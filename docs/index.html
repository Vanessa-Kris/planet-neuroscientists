<p>For the first time,
astronomers may have seen direct evidence of a planet forming around a young
star.</p>



<p>A spiral disk of gas and
dust surrounding the star AB Aurigae contains a small S-shaped twist near the spiral’s
center, infrared telescope images show.</p>



<p>That twist “is the precise
spot where a new planet must be forming,” says astrophysicist Emmanuel Di Folco
of the University of Bordeaux in France. </p>



<p>Previously, astronomers have
seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infant-worlds-carve-gaps-planet-forming-disk">gaps</a> (<em>SN:
11/6/14</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swirling-gases-reveal-baby-planets-young-stars-disk">large-scale spirals</a> (<em>SN: 6/14/18</em>) that are thought to be created by unseen planets
in disks of gas and dust around young stars. Theories of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">how planets coalesce and gather material from these
disks</a> predict that planets’ motions
would further twist the gas around them like swirling skirts, pinpointing a
planet’s location (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>).</p>



<p>Now, Di Folco and colleagues
have used infrared observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array and the Very Large Telescope, both in Chile, to find a spiral and <a href="https://media.eurekalert.org/scipak/gallery/images/2020-05/pashalidou5HR.jpg">zero in on one such S-shaped twist</a> around AB Aurigae. The team describes its findings in
the May <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AB Aurigae and bright knot" class="wp-image-3088255" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052020_lg_baby-planet_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088255">A close-up of the disk of gas and dust (seen here in infrared light) around the young star AB Aurigae (left) reveals a bright knot (right, circled in white) where astronomers think a planet is coalescing. For scale, the blue circle represents the size of Neptune’s orbit.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088255">A. Boccaletti et al/<em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </em>2020, ESO</span></figure>



<p>“It was amazing,” Di Folco
says. “It was exactly as we were expecting from the theoretical predictions of
planet formation.” </p>



<p>The star, about 520
light-years away in the constellation Auriga, is just 4 million years old, about
one one-thousandths of the age of the sun. “It’s really a baby,” Di Folco says.
</p>



<p>The potential planet’s exact mass is not known, but it probably would have to be a gas giant like Jupiter rather than a rocky planet like Earth to make such big waves in the disk. And it might not be alone — there’s a hint of another planet near the disk’s outer edge.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-accelerated-vaccines-treatments-drugs">As we wait for a vaccine, here’s a snapshot of potential COVID-19 treatments</a></h4>

<p>Aggressive public health measures to
stem the tidal wave of coronavirus infections have left people isolated,
unemployed and wondering when it will all end. Life probably won’t go
completely back to normal until vaccines against the virus are available,
experts warn. </p>



<p>Researchers are working hard on that
front. At least six vaccines are currently being tested in people, says Esther
Krofah, chief executive of the FasterCures center at the Milken Institute in Washington,
D.C.  “We expect about two dozen more to
enter clinical trials by this summer and early fall. That is a huge number,”
Krofah said at an April 17 briefing. Dozens more are in earlier stages of
testing.</p>



<p>In unpublished, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people">preliminary results of a test of one vaccine</a>, inoculated people made as many antibodies against the coronavirus as people who have recovered from COVID-19 (<em>SN: 5/18/20</em>). The mRNA-based vaccine induces human cells to make one of the virus’s proteins, which the immune system then builds antibodies to attack. That study was small, only eight people, but a second phase of safety testing has begun. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">vaccines
take time to test thoroughly</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). Even with accelerated
timelines and talk of emergency use of promising vaccines for health care workers
and others at high risk of catching the virus, the general public will likely
wait a year or more to be vaccinated.</p>





<p>In the meantime, new treatments may help
save lives or lessen the severity of disease in people who become ill.
Researchers around the world are experimenting with more than 130 drugs to find
out if any can help COVID-19 patients, according to <a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-04/Covid19%20Tracker%20NEW4-16-20-2.pdf">a
tracker</a> maintained by the Milken Institute.

<h3>Speed it up</h3>



<p>Speed it up The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation proposed a truncated process for COVID-19 vaccine development that replaces the lengthy, traditional linear sequence for testing, producing and licensing a vaccine (top). The new approach (bottom) involves running many steps in parallel, including ramping up manufacturing, even before knowing the vaccine will work.</p>



<h4>Traditional vaccine development</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="graphic illustrating traditional timeline of vaccine development" class="wp-image-3088235" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/060620_ti_vaccine_inline_timeline-traditional.png" /></figure>

<p>Some of those drugs are aimed at
stopping the virus, while others may help calm overactive immune responses that
damage lungs and other organs. Although researchers are testing a battery of
repurposed drugs and devising new ones, there is still a great deal of
uncertainty over whether the drugs help, or maybe even hurt. </p>



<p>The wait is frustrating, but there’s still much doctors and scientists don’t know about how this new coronavirus affects the body. Getting answers will take time, and finding measures to counter the virus that are both safe and effective will take even more. Early results suggest that the antiviral drug remdesivir can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain">modestly speed recovery</a> from COVID-19 (<em>SN: 5/13/20</em>). It is not a cure, but the drug may become the new standard of care as researchers continue to test other therapies.</p>





<h4>Head-on attacks</h4>



<p>Antiviral drugs interfere with a virus’s ability to replicate itself, though such drugs are difficult to create. Remdesivir is being tested in half a dozen clinical trials worldwide. The drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs">mimics a building block of RNA</a>, the genetic material of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 3/10/20</em>). When the virus copies its RNA, remdesivir replaces some of the building blocks, preventing new virus copies from being produced, laboratory studies have shown. </p>



<p>Early results in COVID-19 patients given the drug outside of a clinical trial showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">68 percent needed less oxygen support after treatment</a>, as reported online April 10 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>). The drug went to very sick patients, including those who needed oxygen from a ventilator or through tubes in the nose. Other researchers have disputed those results, questioning the study methods and statistical analyses, which may have given an exaggerated impression of good outcomes. The study’s authors say they have reanalyzed the data and still conclude that remdesivir has benefits.  </p>

<p>Soon after, the U.S. National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced that hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 who got intravenous remdesivir <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19">recovered
more quickly</a> than those on a placebo: in 11 days versus 15. Those findings
had not been reviewed by other scientists at the time of the announcement. The
dug provides researchers with a baseline for comparing other treatments. “We
think it’s really opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability
of treating,” Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID said April 29 in a news
briefing at the White House. </p>



<p>Antiviral medications used against HIV are also being tested against COVID-19. The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir stops an HIV enzyme called the M protease from cutting viral proteins so that the virus can replicate itself. The SARS-CoV-2 virus produces a similar enzyme. But early results from a small study in China showed that the combination <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial">didn’t stop viral replication or improve symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/20</em>), and there were side effects. </p>



<p>For now, the Society of Critical Care
Medicine <a href="https://sccm.org/getattachment/Disaster/SSC-COVID19-Critical-Care-Guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US&amp;_zs=4soSf1&amp;_zl=k1cc6&amp;fbclid=IwAR3JxzPVQMDdqD4Sxt3MDjy0KqR7zrXiqO3zQMc2BCIjMAUO8AifEKh0DIA">recommends
against</a> using the drugs, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America
says patients should get the drugs <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management/">only
as part of a clinical trial</a>. Several large trials may report results soon.</p>



<p>The HIV drugs may not work well against SARS-CoV-2, even though the viruses have similar M proteases: The coronavirus’s enzyme lacks a pocket where the drugs fit in the HIV version of the enzyme.</p>



<p>This illustrates why antiviral drugs are
so difficult to develop. Designing a drug requires knowing the 3-D structure of
the virus’s proteins, which can take months to years. But researchers are
already getting some close-up views of the new coronavirus. A team in China
examined the structure of the coronavirus’s M protease and designed small
molecules that could block a part of the protein necessary to do its job. The
team <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/21/science.abb4489">described
two such molecules</a>, dubbed 11a and 11b, April 22 in <em>Science</em>.  </p>



<p>In test tubes, both molecules stopped the virus from replicating in monkey cells. In mice, 11a stuck around longer in the blood than 11b, so the researchers tested 11a further and found it seemed safe in rats and beagles. More animal tests will probably be needed to show whether it stops the virus, then multiple stages of human tests will have to follow. The drug development and testing process often takes on average 10 years or more, and can fail at any point along the way.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have already recovered from COVID-19, and many are donating blood that might contain virus-fighting antibodies. Clinical trials are under way to test whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-can-plasma-recovered-patients-treat-sick">antibodies from recovered patients</a>’ blood plasma can help people fight off the virus (<em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 6)</em>. More such trials are planned. </p>



<h4>Helping the immune system</h4>



<p>Stopping the virus is only half the problem. In some people seriously ill with COVID-19, their immune system becomes the enemy, unleashing storms of immune chemicals called cytokines. Those cytokines trigger immune cells to join the fight against the virus, but sometimes the cells go too far, causing damaging inflammation. </p>



<p>Some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective">drugs used to calm cytokines</a> in cancer patients (<em>SN: 6/27/18, p. 22</em>) may also help people with COVID-19 ride out the storm, says cancer researcher Lee Greenberger, chief scientific officer of Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Several of those drugs are being tested against the coronavirus now. </p>



<p>Hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved to
treat autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, became a
household word after President Trump touted it as a possible COVID-19
treatment. </p>



<p>The drug is being tested in numerous
large clinical trials around the world to see if it might help calm cytokine
storms in COVID-19 patients as well. But so far, there is no solid evidence that
it works either to prevent infection in people or to treat people who already
have the disease. </p>

<p>And in some studies the drug has caused serious side effects, including causing irregular heartbeats, says Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix. People with heart problems, low potassium or low oxygen levels in their blood are at higher risk of these side effects, he says. And those are exactly the kinds of patients who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. “So, the very sickest COVID patients are those at most risk for these life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiac effects.”</p>



<p>Results of some rigorous clinical trials
of hydroxychloroquine are expected this summer. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration allows the drug to be used when no other treatment is
available and patients can’t join a clinical trial.</p>



<p>Today’s enthusiasm for any drug that
seems promising feels familiar, says Woosley. He remembers the excitement over
AZT, the first drug used to fight HIV in the 1980s. It wasn’t the best drug to
combat the AIDS epidemic, and better ones came later. Likewise, the first
treatments for COVID-19 might be better than nothing, but not the best we will
ultimately get. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, we wait. </p>



<p>With hundreds of clinical trials going on around the world, some answers may come soon. But for now, keeping the coronavirus contained will probably require aggressive testing, tracing and isolating contacts of people who have the virus and continued social distancing.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/05/20/remembering-the-caregivers/">Remembering the Caregivers</a></h4>

<img alt="pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-1-1-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With a rapidly aging population of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) starting dialysis, the demands on caregivers have increased.  The need for help with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing), mobility, transportation, social support and food preparation are often not anticipated.  The burden of these additional roles and lack of support can have a major negative impact on the caregivers physical, social and emotional health.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a> publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01830-9">Shah et al.</a> compared the health related quality of life and the care related quality of life among caregivers of older individuals (&gt;75 years of age) receiving dialysis or conservative care (medical management only).  Caregivers completed surveys that assessed their health related quality of life and experience as caregivers  These surveys addressed areas that healthcare teams often forget such as activities outside care-giving, social support, institutional support, control over caring and relationship with t<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11898 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-300x200.png" width="300" />he care recipient. Utilizing this survey highlights the changes in the caregiver’s life that are often not considered in counseling about end stage kidney disease management with patients and the families. While there was no difference in the HRQoL, the caregivers of dialysis patients reported a worse carer experience, where the survey results of this group reflected the perception of providing an ‘intense’ level of care to recipients in bad health and for more than 20 hours/weeks. This is especially striking considering 70% of the caregivers surveyed had been providing this level of care for &gt;2 years.  These findings highlight the need to expand the dialysis preparations and the support provided to caregivers.</p>
<p>Currently, protocols focus on education about dialysis modality options, early referrals for dialysis access planning/creation and information for the patient about the dialysis procedure.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/15/suppl_3/8/1849543">Most of the data</a> that has helped shape the current approaches have been based on outcomes such as the number of hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality, nutritional status, or infection rates in patients starting dialysis with little or no preparation. While these are important issues to address, this approach does not consider the overall impact of dialysis on the life of the patient or the effects on the caregiver, including changes to their lifestyle, employment and family responsibilities.  As such, many caregivers struggle with how to accommodate the needs of their family member without the skills and resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the increasing number of older individuals needing dialysis support, there is a higher likelihood that they will have comorbidities and thus a potentially greater need for help with care. As a result, caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation. This impact on caregivers was noted in <a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(02)44553-2/abstract">another study</a> of 100 hemodialysis patients and their primary caregivers utilizing the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).  After more than 4 months of dialysis, caregivers were reported to have higher subjective burden scores.  Current practices do not encompass follow-up with the caregivers to see how they are adjusting to the initiation of dialysis and how they are dealing with the transition.  A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/23/12/3960/1888462">systematic review</a> of studies with interventions for informal caregivers demonstrated only three studies with interventions for caregivers and these involved education material to enhance caregiver knowledge.</p>
<p>Our approach to dialysis preparation falls short if providers are not first acknowledging with patients and their caregivers the impact of end-stage kidney disease on their lives and providing the resources and support they need during this transition period.  Understanding what is important to them and what they do on a day-to-day basis in terms of work, family, and social obligations needs to be part of routine discussions.  Discussions about the impact on the family and caregivers also needs to be part of the routine dialysis preparations.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-spiral-disk-galaxy-wolfe-alma">The oldest disk galaxy yet found formed more than 12 billion years ago</a></h4>

<p>The oldest disk-shaped galaxy
ever spotted formed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, a new study
finds. </p>



<p>That’s much earlier than astronomers thought that this type of galaxy could form. Previous observations show that disk-shaped galaxies — including sprawling, spiral systems like the Milky Way — didn’t show up in large numbers until between 3 billion and 4 billion years after the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago.</p>



<p>This precocious galaxy’s
existence suggests that massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2276-y">can grow up relatively quickly</a>, astronomers report in the May 21 <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>By showing that a disk
galaxy could form so early in the universe’s history, the new study “challenges
the accepted paradigm for how disk galaxies form and evolve in the universe,”
says astrophysicist Rachel Somerville of the Flatiron Institute in New York
City, who was not involved in the study.</p>





<p>The earliest galaxies
probably were made when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clumps-dark-matter-could-be-lurking-undetected-our-galaxy">clumps of invisible dark matter</a> pulled in surrounding gas and dust, forming stars and
eventually creating galaxies that were round and blobby, observations and
computer simulations suggest (<em>SN: 1/26/18</em>). Theorists reason that assembling
those early galaxies was a violent process that scrambled and heated gas. Since
hot gas expands, the idea goes, the first galaxies were spherical blobs because
they were too hot for the gas to settle into a disk. Only when gas has had lots
and lots of time to cool off could it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alma-images-starburst-galaxy-star-formation">collapse into bright starry disk galaxies</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/18</em>), researchers thought.</p>



<p>In the last 15 years, however,
computer simulations have showed that cold streams of gas could sneak into ancient,
blobby galaxies, potentially making it easier for disk galaxies to arise more
quickly.</p>



<p>To see if that process,
called the cold accretion method, actually occurs in the universe, astronomer
Marcel Neeleman and colleagues sought the earliest disk galaxies they could
find. Most early galaxies are too far away and thus too faint for Earth-based
telescopes to catch light from their stars. But sensitive radio telescopes can detect
light from even more distant quasars — blazing, white-hot disks surrounding
supermassive black holes — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">filtering through the galaxies’ gas</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>). A bright quasar behind the
early disk galaxy, called DLA0817g, let it show up in silhouette, revealing the
galaxy’s contents and structure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="radio wave image of a spiral galaxy called the Wolfe Disk" class="wp-image-3088231" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051920_lg_olddiskgalaxy_inline-599x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088231">The oldest disk galaxy ever spotted (shown in radio waves) was seen with the ALMA radio telescope in Chile.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088231">M. Neeleman, ESO, NAOJ, ALMA, S. Dagnello/NRAO, AUI, NSF</span></figure>



<p>Neeleman, of the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, and his colleagues <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1285">first saw hints of DLA0817g</a> using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array in Chile, the team reported in 2017.
Follow-up observations in 2019 showed that the galaxy is rotating like a record:
Half of the galaxy’s gas is moving away from Earth, and half is moving toward us.
That motion is a sure sign that the galaxy is a cold, flat rotating disk, and
likely has a spiral shape, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The galaxy is also massive,
at least 72 billion times the mass of the sun. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-active-galaxies-early-universe-may-have-finally-been-found">Behemoth galaxies have been spotted</a> in the early universe before (<em>SN: 8/7/19</em>). Growing
a massive galaxy of any shape so quickly “is challenging enough,” says astronomer
and study coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska of the University of California, Santa
Cruz. “But the shocker is to see one in a nice spiral disk.”</p>



<p>The team unofficially named
the galaxy the Wolfe Disk after astrophysicist Arthur Wolfe of the University of
California, San Diego, <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/in_memoriam_arthur_m._wolfe_1939_2014">who died in 2014</a>. Wolfe was one of the first to suggest that disk galaxies existed in
the universe’s infancy, to widespread skepticism, says Prochaska, who was one
of Wolfe’s Ph.D. students.</p>



<p>“He was right, at least partially,” Prochaska says. “He deserves credit for having planted that flag against all conventional wisdom.”</p>

<p>Scientists
can’t yet rebuild someone with bionic body parts. They don’t have the
technology. But a new artificial eye brings cyborgs one step closer to reality.
</p>



<p>This
device, which mimics the human eye’s structure, is about as sensitive to light
and has a faster reaction time than a real eyeball. It may not come with the telescopic
or night vision capabilities that Steve Austin had in <em>The</em> <em>Six Million
Dollar Man</em> television show,
but this electronic eyepiece does have the potential for sharper vision than
human eyes, researchers report in the May 21 <em>Nature</em>. </p>



<p>“In
the future, we can use this for better vision prostheses and humanoid
robotics,” says engineer and materials scientist Zhiyong Fan of the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology.</p>



<p>The
human eye owes its wide field of view and high-resolution eyesight to the dome-shaped
retina — an area at the back of the eyeball covered in light-detecting cells.
Fan and colleagues used a curved aluminum oxide membrane, studded with nanosize
sensors made of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">light-sensitive material called a perovskite</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/17</em>), to mimic
that architecture in their synthetic eyeball. Wires attached to the artificial
retina send readouts from those sensors to external circuitry for processing,
just as nerve fibers relay signals from a real eyeball to the brain. </p>





<p>The
artificial eyeball registers changes in lighting faster than human eyes can —
within about 30 to 40 milliseconds, rather than 40 to 150 milliseconds. The
device can also see dim light about as well as the human eye. Although its
100-degree field of view isn’t as broad as the 150 degrees a human eye can take
in, it’s better than the 70 degrees visible to ordinary flat imaging sensors. </p>



<p>In
theory, this synthetic eye could perceive a much higher resolution than the
human eye, because the artificial retina contains about 460 million light
sensors per square centimeter. A real retina has about 10 million
light-detecting cells per square centimeter. But that would require separate readings
from each sensor. In the current setup, each wire plugged into the synthetic retina
is about one millimeter thick, so big that it touches many sensors at once.
Only 100 such wires fit across the back of the retina, creating images that
have 100 pixels. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Eye spy</h3>



<p>The design for a new artificial eye (illustrated) is based on the structure of the human eye. At the back of the eyeball, a synthetic retina is embedded with nanoscale light sensors. Those sensors measure light that passes through the lens at the front of the eye. Wires attached to the back of the retina ferry signals from those sensors to external circuitry for processing, similar to the way nerve fibers connect the eyeball to the brain.  </p>

<p>To
show that thinner wires could be connected to the artificial eyeball for higher
resolution, Fan’s team used a magnetic field to attach a small array of metal
needles, each 20 to 100 micrometers thick, to nanosensors on the synthetic
retina one by one. “It’s like a surgical operation,” Fan says.</p>



<p>The researchers’ current method of creating individual ultrasmall pixels is impractical, says Hongrui Jiang, an electrical engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison whose <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-01420-7">commentary</a> on the study appears in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. “For a few hundred nanowires, okay, fine, but how about millions?” Engineers will need a much more efficient way to manufacture vast arrays of tiny wires on the back of the artificial eyeball to give it superhuman sight, he says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-genetic-link-asians-native-americans-siberia">The oldest genetic link between Asians and Native Americans was found in Siberia</a></h4>

<p>DNA gleaned from a roughly 14,000-year-old fragment of a human
tooth suggests that people inhabiting a surprisingly large swath of Asia were the
ancestors of the first Americans.</p>



<p>This tooth, unearthed at a site just south of Lake Baikal in
southern Siberia, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.037">provides
the oldest known genetic link</a> between Stone Age Asians and ancient American
settlers, scientists report May 20 in <em>Cell</em>.
Present-day Native Americans in North and South America are partly related to
those early arrivals, the team says.</p>



<p>Like a previously studied, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-reveals-ancient-siberians-set-stage-first-americans">nearly
10,000-year-old man in northeastern Siberia</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/19</em>), the southern Siberian individual inherited genes from

<p>Using DNA already extracted from human remains at several
ancient Siberian sites, archaeogeneticist He Yu of the Max Planck Institute for
the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and her colleagues conclude that
one of those ancestral populations originated in northeastern Asia, east of
Lake Baikal. The other hailed from north-central Asia, west of the lake.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where and when members of those two populations
met up and mingled. But mating between them produced a mix of DNA that
characterized people who crossed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-ice-free-pathway-americas-heats">a
land bridge to what’s now Alaska</a> perhaps 16,000 years ago or more, the
researchers say (<em>SN: 8/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>Until now, many researchers have assumed that Native Americans’ genetic roots lay only in northeastern Asia.</p>

<p>The correct categorization of scholarly works is vitally important. It helps readers find the information they seek — and assures authors that their research will be found by the right audience. Recently, arXiv released a new user-driven classification tool to help authors choose the correct category for their papers during the submission process.</p>
<p>“I think this is a great addition, and I am already seeing positive effects,” said Frank Simon, Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, Munich, Germany and arXiv moderator. “Since the feature has been in operation, submitters tend to classify things for my category (physics.ins-det) correctly more often.”</p>
<p>When submitting to arXiv, authors select a category for their paper, such as computational geometry or quantum physics. Now, in real time, the automated classifier double checks that selection by comparing the paper to those already hosted on arXiv.org. If the author’s selection doesn’t match the classifier’s recommendation, an alternate category is proposed. The author can review the suggestion, accept or decline it, and continue the submission process, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg"><img alt="This is a screen shot of arXiv's classifier recommendation tool." class="alignnone wp-image-624 size-full" height="378" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg" width="1000" /></a></p>
<p>In the past, only moderators had access to the automated classifier recommendations, after submission. Moderators reviewed the recommendations, and, if necessary, reclassified papers. This added time to the process and often led to delays.</p>
<p>Integrating the classifier recommendations into the submission process empowers authors and increases transparency when reclassification is necessary. Additionally, this feature is expected to reduce the workload for moderators and lower the number of papers put on hold due to misclassification. Improved category selection during the submission process will provide more accurate classification at the outset and therefore reduce delays in announcing papers.</p>
<p>“In my category, the most common issue is the case where instrumentation papers that should have physics.ins-det as primary category are instead submitted to hep-ex, nucl-ex, physics.optics or the like, and subsequently need to be reclassified,” Simon said. “Alerting the submitters that their instrumentation paper should be submitted to the instrumentation category rather than one of the others will reduce moderation workload and speed up the release of the articles, so it is a win-win situation for both submitters and moderators.”</p>
<p>Other moderators have also expressed enthusiasm about the new feature, calling it important, worthwhile, a fantastic idea, and a big step forward, “even if there will be hiccups” in the beginning. In the first four days after release, 17.4% papers received category recommendations and 67.5% of authors accepted the suggested category.</p>
<p>arXiv continues to welcome feedback on this feature, which was first tested by volunteer moderators. Authors who receive a category recommendation will have the opportunity to complete a survey about their experience. Moderators are sharing their observations and experiences with arXiv staff, and staff members are monitoring server log statistics.</p>
<p>Moving forward, arXiv is developing a new version of this machine learning classifier tool that will be trained by feedback from users and moderators in order to provide better category recommendations in the future.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Memory complaints are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02982590">fairly common among elderly people</a>. Together with low participation in cognitively demanding activities, such as reading or doing crosswords, they can predict future declines — including the risk of developing dementia.</p>
<p>It might seem likely, then, that people with poorer cognitive functioning may report more problems, and may be less able to engage in (and so benefit from) reading or other stimulating activities. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-15673-001">new paper</a>, published in <em>Psychology and Aging</em>, suggests that another factor is more important in predicting both these complaints and engagement in stimulating activities: personality.<span id="more-39638"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, led by Patrick Hill at Washington University in St Louis, analysed data from 136 Swiss older adults, with an average age of about 70. (The data came from a bigger study into how the everyday behaviour of older people is linked to maintaining or improving wellbeing and health). The participants first completed a series of lab-based cognitive tasks, including memory tests, and self-report questionnaires, which included an assessment of the “Big Five” personality traits. Then, at the end of each of the next ten days, they used smartphones to report on any cognitive complaints during that day (e.g. “I misplaced or lost an object such as keys or glasses”), and also instances of cognitive engagement (e.g. “I enjoyed thinking about a complicated problem”).</p>
<p>Taking into account each participant’s age, education level and subjective health, the team then looked at how initial cognitive task results and personality trait scores might relate to the subsequent smartphone data.</p>
<p>They found that the number of daily cognitive complaints was significantly correlated with scores on all of the personality traits, but just one of the measures of  cognitive performance (processing speed). Strikingly, scores on the two initial specific memory tests did not correlate with daily cognitive complaints. (This somewhat surprising observation is in fact <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714573">supported by recent work</a> that suggests our cognitive self-perceptions are relatively distinct from our actual performance).</p>
<p>When all of these variables were put into a model, however, only one factor emerged as being key. This was openness to experience, a personality trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits, and a willingness to try new things.  Participants who initially scored higher for openness went on to report, on average, fewer cognitive complaints each day, and also more, and more varied, cognitive engagement.</p>
<p>There may be two reasons for this, the researchers suggest. Firstly, measures of openness tap into a person’s self-perceptions of their intellectual ability and creativity. People with a stronger belief in their intellectual capacities may perceive fewer cognitive issues in daily life. Secondly, people who are more open are of course more willing to engage in varied novel experiences. Because they enjoy intellectual activities, they may be driven to think more, and in more different ways — and this could protect against cognitive decline. In fact, there are other recent findings that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607863.2019.1655705">diversity in cognitive activity</a>, rather than total time spent in these kinds of tasks, may be more beneficial for cognitive performance in older age.</p>
<p>The work also suggests that in understanding why some interventions work better for some older people than others, personality traits should be taken into account. Also, interventions that encourage openness may potentially be more effective.</p>
<p>However, as the researchers themselves add, all of the personality traits, demographic variables and initial cognitive performance measures only account for a small amount of the differences in the level of cognitive complaints and engagement between people. The team would like to see more work to drill into potential links with personality in finer detail. But other factors that are yet to be well-characterised — levels of stress, perhaps — may well turn out to be far more important.</p>

<p>For the fifth year in a row, the number of babies born in the United States has declined. It’s the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-8-508.pdf">lowest number of births</a> — just under 3.75 million in 2019, gleaned from birth certificate data — since 1985, according to the report published online May 20 from the National Center for Health Statistics. Since 2014, that number has been dropping 1 percent on average per year.</p>



<p>There’s been a general
downward trend in births since the Great Recession, which lasted from 2007 to
2009. In periods of economic uncertainty, births tend to drop, says family
demographer Karen Benjamin Guzzo of Bowling Green State University in Ohio. But
rather than rebounding after the recession ended, as would be expected, births
have continued to fall. It’s an indication that not everyone’s prospects
improved as the economy recovered, she says.</p>



<p>People like to feel certain
about their coming years before they have children, says Guzzo, who was not
involved in the new report. But many younger adults struggle with student loan
debt, face soaring home prices and hold jobs that lack health benefits or sick
days, she says. Considering
the costs for childcare and providing for their children’s education on top of
that leads some people to question whether they can afford to be a good parent.</p>



<p>“When the economy
sort of writ large looks good,” Guzzo says, “it doesn’t necessarily mean it
looks good for individuals and particularly for younger folks in their child
bearing years.” Even if young people are
working, she says, “they’re just not in a place where they feel confident in
their future.”  </p>





<p>And, she adds, “this
is all pre-COVID, so you can imagine this [uncertainty] is only going to get
worse.” </p>



<p>The report breaks
down birthrates by age and the percentage change from 2018 to 2019. Women in
their 20s and early 30s saw a drop. For example, women ages 25 to 29 had a
birthrate of 93.7 births per 1,000 in 2019; that’s down 2 percent from 2018. Meanwhile,
the birthrate of women in their early 40s rose slightly.</p>



<p>A bright spot in the report is the teen birth rate, down 5 percent from 2018. It’s now 16.6 births per 1,000 teenaged girls ages 15 to 19. That rate has plummeted by 60 percent since 2007, largely because more teens today have access to effective and long-lasting methods of birth control. </p>

<p>People who test positive again for the coronavirus, despite having already recovered from COVID-19, aren’t being reinfected, a new study finds. </p>



<p>Reports of patients discharged
from hospitals in South Korea testing positive after their apparent recovery had
raised concerns that people could get infected by the virus in the short term more
than once or that the infection could come back. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-where-things-stand-tests-testing-united-states">diagnostic tests for the coronavirus</a> that causes COVID-19 rely on detecting the
virus’s genetic material (<em>SN: 4/17/20</em>).
A positive result does not indicate whether a person is shedding viruses
capable of infecting cells —
which would signal an active infection. </p>



<p>Now, a May 19 report from the
Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that samples from
“reinfected” <a href="https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&amp;bid=0030">patients don’t have infectious viruses</a>. The finding hints that the diagnostic tests are picking up
on the genetic material from noninfectious or dead viruses. That lack of infectious virus particles means
these people aren’t currently infected and can’t transmit the coronavirus to
others, the researchers say. </p>



<p>“It’s good news,” says Angela
Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “It appears people are not
being reinfected, and this virus is not reactivating.” </p>

<p>In the
study, researchers tried to isolate infectious coronaviruses from samples taken
from 108 people who retested positive. All of those samples tested negative. When the scientists examined 23 of those patients for antibodies
against the coronavirus, almost all had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">neutralizing antibodies</a> that can stop the virus from getting into
cells (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>). That immune
response may protect a person from getting reinfected, at least in the short term.
</p>



<p>The team also tracked down
790 contacts of 285 people who retested positive. Of those contacts, 27 tested
positive for the coronavirus. Twenty-four of those were cases that officials
had previously confirmed. Officials also identified three new cases, all of
whom either had contact with the Shincheonji religious group — which was hit particularly hard in
the early days of the pandemic — or a
confirmed case in their family. No new cases appeared to stem from repeat
positive patients, a sign those patients aren’t contagious. </p>



<p>Now, “we can largely stop
worrying about reinfection and address the next big questions,” Rasmussen says.
“How protective are immune responses in recovered patients, and how long does
immunity last?” </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8JlRc1UWymM/">Preprints and the Media: A change to how PLOS handles press for papers previously posted as preprints</a></h4>

<p><em>This post was written by Beth Baker, PLOS’ Senior Media Relations Manager.</em></p>



<p><em>#PowerToThePreprint</em></p>



<p><em>PLOS actively encourages the posting of preprints – please see </em><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/"><em>https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/</em></a><em> for all the ways authors can engage. Posting of preprints and discussion of preprints will never </em><em>affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal</em><em>.</em></p>



<p>From today, articles accepted at PLOS journals that were previously posted as a preprint will be under a press embargo which lifts upon publication. This alters our prior practice of not applying an embargo to articles that were previously posted as a preprint and means that we will be applying a consistent press embargo to all articles published at PLOS. We have made this decision after conducting research revealing the positive impact of press embargoes for PLOS papers. The change will optimize authors’ opportunities to disseminate their work to the public via the press and will ensure that authors who have posted preprints are not disadvantaged by this choice, nor are authors disincentivized to post preprints.</p>



<p><strong>Open communication of research, and the value of embargoes</strong></p>



<p>PLOS’ press embargo policy is designed to positively impact researchers and to aid the communication of their work. We work to facilitate open communication of research wherever possible. PLOS encourages the discussion of research between scientists at all stages in the publication process. Researchers are free to present and discuss their work for scientific purposes prior to publication. This includes talking about research at conferences and on preprint servers.</p>



<p>While we know that preprints play a crucial role in the efficiency of scientific communication, establishing priority sooner, increasing attention, and opening up the review process to all, we also believe that public attention at scale via the media should focus on the most reliable science: published, peer-reviewed research. Press embargoes continue to be the best tool to facilitate that. </p>



<p>Embargoes enable authors to achieve accurate, high-quality media coverage which disseminates their peer-reviewed research to non-expert readers. Since our articles are accessible to everyone, everywhere upon publication, our embargoes also ensure that peer-reviewed published articles are accessible to the public when first reported in the media.</p>



<p>Embargoes provide fair and equal access for journalists to allow them time to research their stories and to speak with experts. They give press officers adequate time to coordinate coverage with scientists at their institutions, and give researchers the opportunity to provide comments.</p>



<p>Discussion of research prior to publication, whether in the scientific community or in the media, will never affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal. Prior coverage in the media may simply affect if and how PLOS promotes that research at the time of publication.</p>



<p><strong>Background to our research</strong></p>



<p>PLOS partnered with preprint server bioRxiv in May 2018 to help authors opt in to preprints. Soon after, we decided not to embargo for media purposes any published papers which had previously been posted as preprints, believing that embargoes might not be meaningful, necessary, or practical for these papers. Instead, we distributed press releases for such research without embargo at the time of publication, and encouraged institutions to do likewise.</p>



<p>Following implementation of this embargo exception for preprinted papers, we heard concerns from journalists, press officers and the UK Science Media Centre about this policy. Some parties felt that releasing preprinted research without embargo could result in less media coverage, or in lower quality, less accurate coverage, as journalists would race to report on research immediately or decide not to cover it at all. Concerns were also raised that not embargoing preprinted research meant forfeiting a valuable tool to help journalists focus on covering peer-reviewed published research rather than non-peer-reviewed preprints.</p>



<p>PLOS’ media team therefore investigated the claim that non-embargoed preprinted papers received less media coverage.</p>



<p><strong>What we researched and what we found</strong></p>



<p>We took all the preprinted papers we’d press released without embargo between October 1, 2018 (when we introduced the policy) and September 11, 2019 and paired each with a paper we’d press released under embargo that published at around the same time. Each paired paper was from the same journal as the preprinted paper, and for our multidisciplinary journal PLOS ONE, we also ensured the paired paper was in the same broad scientific area.</p>



<p>We examined the amount of media coverage each paper had received by measuring the number of mentions of the paper in the media, using media intelligence software Meltwater. We used paired t tests to assess if differences found were statistically significant. </p>



<p>We found that the preprinted papers press released without embargo received significantly less media coverage than the paired papers press released under embargo. This was true both in terms of total media mentions (74.60 more media mentions (19.27 vs 93.87); 95% CI: 14.07 – 135.13) and in terms of media mentions in the highest profile outlets (1.47 fewer high profile mentions (0.07 vs 1.53); 95% CI: 0.55 – 2.39). We note that our sample size was small, comprising 30 preprinted papers press released without embargo and 30 paired papers, and we only examined two broad measures of media attention. However, these results support the anecdotes we had previously heard.</p>



<p><strong>How we are reacting</strong></p>



<p>Our research indicates that embargoed papers receive more media coverage, including in the most high-profile news outlets, than papers which are not embargoed. A practice of not embargoing papers previously posted as preprints therefore risked disadvantaging authors who posted preprints, and/or disincentivizing the posting of preprints, which PLOS actively encourages. We have decided to change our practice to treat all our authors equally, and to maximize authors’ opportunities to work with the press to disseminate their work to the public.</p>



<p>From today, all PLOS publications promoted to the press will be <a href="https://www.plos.org/embargo-policy">embargoed until the time of publication</a>. We believe that this change will enable all our authors to reap the benefits of the embargo system – whether or not they have previously posted preprints – and will facilitate continued high-quality science communication to the public.</p>

<p>As more U.S. states reopen and people return to public life, dance fitness classes in South Korea tell a cautionary tale.</p>



<p>A workshop to train instructors for the classes, which are similar to Zumba, ultimately led to more than 100 people falling sick with COVID-19, a new study finds. Nearly 30 teachers participated in the February 15 workshop, which involved intense physical activity for four hours. Later, it was revealed that eight of the participants were infected with the coronavirus, though none had symptoms at the time. By March 9, scientists had identified 112 cases linked to roughly hour-long dance classes at 12 sports facilities and traced them back to the workshop. </p>



<p>The turbulent air flow caused by <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-0633_article#suggestedcitation">intense physical exercise in densely
populated sports facilities</a> could help spread the virus, the researchers report in the August
<em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. </p>

<p>Curiously, one infected instructor taught Pilates and yoga classes
of about eight people, but none of those students tested positive for the
virus. Those classes’ lower aerobic intensity may be why the virus didn’t
spread as easily, the researchers speculate. Class size may also be a factor. </p>



<p>Some states are letting gyms reopen, but there are lots of unanswered questions about whether that’s safe, as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bv88dw/missing-going-to-gym-coronavirus">detailed by female powerlifter Casey Johnston</a> in <em>Vice</em>.</p>

<p>Stay-at-home orders haven’t
just curbed the spread of COVID-19. They’ve briefly cleared the air. </p>



<p>Daily global <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x">carbon dioxide emissions dropped 17 percent</a>, from about 100 million metric tons to about 83
million metric tons, in early April compared with average daily emissions in
2019, researchers report May 19 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. Among other
changes, the lock-downs grounded planes, reduced traffic and changed peoples’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-actions-reduce-carbon-footprint">patterns of energy consumption</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>). </p>



<p>Quantifying the impact of
those changes on global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in real time is tricky; most
emissions data are reported annually, not day by day or even month by month. So
climate scientist Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia in Norwich,
England, and colleagues used daily data such as electricity demand, city
congestion and readouts from smart meters in homes to estimate emissions for 69
countries. Then, the researchers created a “confinement index” based on the
stringency of government-imposed policies in different locations and over time.
</p>

<p>During the most stringent
confinement periods, when only essential workers were permitted to commute, daily
aviation activity shrank by 75 percent, the team reports. Surface
transportation was reduced by about 50 percent, while power use shrank by about
15 percent. </p>



<p>If the world returns to a pre-pandemic level of activity by mid-June, the researchers say, 2020’s emissions will be about 4 percent lower than in 2019. If some restrictions remain through the end of the year, 2020 emissions could be as much as 7 percent lower.  </p>



<p>This COVID-19–related decline in emissions isn’t sustainable, and comes at a very high cost, says coauthor Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Stanford University. However, it highlights the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">depth of the cuts needed</a> to reach emissions targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). To limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, nations would need to reduce emissions by 7.6 percent each year over the next decade, scientists say.  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-this-tube-worm-slime-goo-mucus-can-glow-blue">Here’s a clue to how this tube worm’s slime can glow blue for days</a></h4>

<p>Predators that tread on a colony of parchment tube worms may find themselves slimed. When threatened, these ocean creatures exude a sticky mucus that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parchment-worms-are-best-pinched-dark">can glow blue for days</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/14</em>). </p>



<p>This sort of light produced by animals, bacteria or algae typically is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silent-sparks-illuminates-fascinating-world-fireflies">gone in a flash</a> (<em>SN: 6/12/16</em>). But with the mucus oozed by <em>Chaetopterus </em>tube worms, “we have easily 16 hours and sometimes 72 hours of light,” says Evelien De Meulenaere, a biochemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. New results suggest that the slime’s <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.04618">own light may help it shine on</a> by triggering chemical reactions that sustain the glow.</p>



<p>Making and sustaining such bioluminescence requires energy. But the slime’s power source is a mystery since it glows outside the body, where it can’t draw energy from the worms. So to unlock its secrets, scientists are dissecting the goo’s complicated chemistry. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="a marine parchment tubeworm in natural light" class="wp-image-3088016" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051120_cg_glowworm_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088016">A marine parchment tube worm, shown here under natural light, harnesses complex chemistry to make a glowing mucus. The slime sticks to predators that threaten the colony and may serve as “burglar alarm” when oozed out by threatened worms.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088016">David Liittschwager</span></figure>



<p>De Meulenaere and her colleagues noticed a spike in the mucus’s light when they exposed the slime to blue light. “That’s the weirdest thing,” she says. “The mucus produces blue light itself. So is it powering itself?” </p>



<p>To find out, the researchers separated molecules from the mucus based on size and other properties to identify proteins, sugars and metals. This process of untangling the slime’s recipe revealed that iron may contribute to the enduring glow. The mucus contains ferritin, a protein that stores iron and releases electrically charged iron atoms, or ions. Those ions can trigger the mucus to emit bursts of blue light, the team found. </p>





<p>The ferritin itself seems to respond to blue light, with the help of another blue light–absorbing molecule, by releasing the ions more quickly, De Meulenaere and her team found. That suggests that light from <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.04618">the slime may help trigger more light production</a> to sustain the glow. The team planned to present the results in early April at Experimental Biology 2020, but the meeting was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>





<p>The goo’s glow was first investigated in the 1960s, and then was essentially forgotten, says biologist Warren Francis at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who was not involved with the study. The new research is shedding light on the slime’s enduring shine, but the data don’t yet paint a clear picture of the roles of blue light and ferritin in the glow’s chemistry, he says.  </p>



<p>“Understanding how it works gives us a big clue to how these animals function in their own world,” Francis says. And it could help humans too. The bioluminescence of jellyfish and fireflies have provided powerful tools that help biologists study the workings of cells. “There’s potentially huge numbers of applications,” he says.</p>



<p>Perhaps someday, the study authors suggest, scientists could use the snot’s secrets to create a long-lasting light that glows on and on. </p>

<p>Physicists have harnessed the aloofness
of quantum particles to create a new type of crystal. </p>



<p>Some particles shun one another because
they are forbidden to take on the same quantum state as their neighbors. Atoms
can be so reluctant to overlap that they form a crystal-like arrangement even
when they aren’t exerting any forces on one another, physicists report May 8 at
arXiv.org. Called a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03929">Pauli crystal</a>,
the configuration is the result of a quantum mechanical rule called the Pauli
exclusion principle.</p>



<p>Scientists had previously predicted the
existence of Pauli crystals, but no one had observed them until now. “It just teaches
us how beautiful physics is,” says quantum physicist Tilman Esslinger of ETH Zurich.
The experiment reveals there are still new phenomena to be observed from a
foundational principle taught in introductory physics classes. “If I wrote a
textbook,” Esslinger says, “I would put that [experiment] in.”</p>



<p>Although the Pauli crystals themselves are
based on known physics, the technique used to observe them could help
scientists better understand certain mysterious states of matter, such as superconductors,
materials that conduct electricity without resistance, or superfluids, which
flow without friction.</p>





<p>Discovered by Austrian physicist
Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/electrons-display-their-antisocial-nature">Pauli exclusion principle</a> forbids electrons within an atom from acquiring
matching sets of quantum properties, such as energy and angular momentum (<em>SN: 4/10/99</em>). Physicists soon realized
that the rule governs not only electrons but an entire class of particles
called fermions, which in addition to electrons includes protons, neutrons and
many types of atoms. As a result, fermions can repel one another without directly
interacting. Whereas typical crystals form their regular arrangements thanks to
electromagnetic interactions, a Pauli crystal forms only due to this repulsion.
</p>



<p>“It’s the most simple state of matter
that you can imagine,” says Selim Jochim of Heidelberg University in Germany.</p>



<p>Jochim and colleagues created their
Pauli crystal out of lithium atoms, corralled by lasers into a two-dimensional
region about a micrometer in radius. The researchers put groups of three or six
atoms in that trap at a time. The atoms were too close together to directly
image their positions to reveal any crystal-like structure. Instead, the team measured
the atoms’ momenta by watching where the particles traveled when released. After
the experiment was repeated many times, the researchers found correlations, or
patterns, in the atoms’ momenta. </p>

Jochim Group/Heidelberg Univ.</span></figure>



<p>Because position and momentum are
closely related properties for these trapped particles, the relationship
between the momenta also means that the atoms formed a regular spatial
configuration akin to a crystal. Different flower-shaped configurations of the
particles’ momenta arose depending on the number of particles in the trap.</p>



<p>“You can really see this pattern,” says Magdalena Załuska-Kotur of the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, part of a team of physicists that had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14952-2">previously predicted</a> that such structures could be observed in this type of experiment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology/">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a></h4>

<p>It’s May and many of us have fond memories of springtime when we were in high school. There was some stress from exams and final papers to be sure, but also more outdoor activities, sports, banquets or awards assemblies, proms, and most of all, looking forward to the summer. High school students today, however, have lost all of that. Seemingly in an instant, they are confined at home, with little access to friends, no organized sports, arts, music, journalism, or other activities. Education via teleconferencing is of variable quality and is no substitute for the interactive learning with other students and a skilled educator. Most of all, our students face an uncertain future. It is especially difficult for teens to foresee or plan for a future with the current disruption. Adolescents may well not be able to deal with these multiple concerns, so it’s predictable and understandable that many high school students are struggling with anxiety and depressed mood. Even before the pandemic adolescents had high rates of clinical anxiety and depression. We are facing an enormous mental health crisis.</p><p>As parents there’s a lot we can do to help support our teens. Here are some practical tips to alleviate anxiety and promote stability during this uncertain time.</p><p>Create a schedule.<strong> </strong>Maintaining a regular schedule can provide a sense of stability for the whole family. Teens still have school; many parents are working and those form the basic skeleton of the day. Online learning can be draining so I suggest periodic breaks, at least 15 minutes of stretching, running in place, or going outside (if possible) every two hours or so. Teens with attentional issue may need more frequent breaks.  Add structured time for meditation, pleasant events, and physical activity. Many schools, online programs, and apps can support a meditation practice.  At the minimum we can teach our children to take just a few minutes to breathe deeply as a break from the stresses of the day. I am partial to Dr. Andrew Weil’s simple 4-7-8 approach, breathing in for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and then exhaling very slowly for eight seconds.  I can feel a sense of relaxation at about number five during the exhale. This small exercise is helpful to everyone and can quell anxiety. Evenings might be a time to reclaim long-forgotten family activities from when the teens were younger: baking, doing puzzles, working on family history projects, or even watching television together can foster connection and emphasize the family as foundational.</p><p>Limit access to the news. Normally I think that high schoolers learn about government and global issues and develop a critical eye from reading or watching the news. Right now, however, it can be overwhelming to see the stories, not only of death and pain but also unemployment and the plight of our most vulnerable citizens. You can share with your teen why watching too much coronavirus or political news can be demoralizing. Everyone is different, but 30 minutes is plenty of time to catch up on the news and you can add some time for discussion. You can also help yourself and your teen by being a good role model of having boundaries about watching the news.</p><p>Help them stay connected. Teens can continue to find ways to relate to their friends even during this time of social distancing and sheltering in place. In the past I viewed too much time on social media as destructive, especially to young women. However, in the current situation, social media can, if used responsibly, provide a sense of connection, shared goals, and distraction. I recommend being more flexible about screen time.  Email, texts, and even writing letters will help (and older relatives will appreciate the letters). In addition to connections to their friends, we can encourage teens to form connections to the larger community. We’ve seen that teens can be creative and generous by volunteering, whether making masks, raising money for charity online or contributing art work.</p><p>Foster self-efficacy. In isolation, it is can be difficult for teenagers to feel any sense of competence other than academics. Teens with learning differences may be having an especially difficult time adjusting to virtual learning. Assign tasks at home, including daily chores and longer-term ones like organizing family photos, building a table, creating new menus, and so on.  Older teens can help their siblings or cousins with schoolwork. Ask your high schoolers how they think they can help out; their creativity may surprise you. All these activities help the family and teens still appreciate your acknowledgment of a job well done. Learning a new skill or completing a project also elicits the “I’ve got this” feeling, that leads to improved mood and can foster independence.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by Anastasia Gepp via<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/girl-teen-caf%C3%A9-smartphone-sorrow-1848477"> Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/624410018/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/" rel="nofollow">How to prepare for death</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/quantitative-thinking-during-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Quantitative thinking during a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/the-life-and-legacy-of-florence-nightingale-timeline/" rel="nofollow">The life and legacy of Florence Nightingale [timeline]</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>We all know that too little sleep is bad for us. Matthew Walker, a UC Berkeley sleep scientist and author of the best-selling <em>Why We Sleep</em>, has gone so far <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p061pxj4">as to declare</a>: “The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life.” However, some researchers fear that our concerns about not getting enough sleep are becoming overblown — and that, ironically, they could be making the problem worse. In this feature, we take a look at evidence that “too little” sleep isn’t always the disaster that it’s held up to be.<span id="more-39623"></span></p>
<p><strong>It’s not always about a lack of sleep</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be familiar with the chronotype concepts of larks (early to bed and early to rise) and owls (late to bed, and late to rise). Most kids start out as larks, but during adolescence, many shift to becoming owls. Waking up late is fine for teenagers at the weekends, but not during the school week. Unsurprisingly, then, various studies have found that delaying the time school starts improves academic results for this age-group, and many sleep scientists and paediatricians <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2014.942666">support such a policy</a>. It’s been assumed that this is because it allows teens to get a decent night’s sleep. But there’s some evidence that this may not be the reason. A recent study of Dutch secondary school pupils, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, found that owls did get poorer exam grades, but this effect <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/17/its-not-just-lack-of-sleep-why-pupils-with-an-owl-chronotype-get-lower-grades/">was largely independent of sleep duration</a>.</p>
<p>This suggests that even when owls get “enough” sleep, they don’t do as well as larks on exams. And this, it seems, is because exams are often administered in the mornings, when owls aren’t at their cognitive peak. When owls took exams in the afternoon, closer to that peak, they achieved similar grades as larks. This was especially true for science subjects. Of course, if the school day starts later, then exams start later — and this could be a better fit for many teens’ chronotype. What this all means, though, is that, in many cases, trying to get teens to go to bed earlier, to sleep for longer, may not make as much of a difference to their performance at school as has been claimed.</p>
<p><strong>Cause or effect?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety, OCD, ADHD, schizophrenia, PTSD… all kinds of mental health problems are associated with sleep problems, too. It’s now recognised that the relationship is circular, with mental illness and insomnia exacerbating each other. It’s not as simple, then, as a lack of sleep causing symptoms. And certainly, there’s evidence that stress early in life can set you up for insomnia much later. One study found that children who grew up in families with high levels of conflict <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/too-stressed-sleep">went on to be more likely to have insomnia as adults</a>. This held even when any sleep problems or depression during childhood were controlled for in the analysis — so it wasn’t a case of participants who’d had trouble sleeping as kids still having these difficulties as adults. And when it comes to depression, the links between sleep and symptoms can be surprising…</p>
<p><b>A surprising therapy</b></p>
<p>Depriving depressed people of sleep works as an effective <em>treatment</em>. This was shown in series of studies starting <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/468269">almost 50 years ago</a>. But it has become a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549913">standard therapy</a> only recently. Healthy people deprived of sleep will generally find that their mood worsens. But for people with depression, staying awake for at least a night can do the opposite (temporarily, anyway). The impacts are rapid, and work on most patients, as a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067264">study in Denmark</a>, for example, has found. Exactly how the treatment works is still debated, but it’s thought to shock a sluggish biological clock.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep doesn’t <em>always</em> improve memory</strong></p>
<p>The evidence that sleep is important for memory is pretty overwhelming. But, recently, at least one study has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/22/getting-some-sleep-doesnt-make-eyewitnesses-any-better-at-identifying-suspects/">challenged the idea</a> that sleep always brings memory benefits. Given the experimental record, the researchers had expected to find that eye-witnesses who were given the chance to sleep would be better at identifying suspects the following day. But they weren’t…</p>
<p>This was a big study: 2000 participants watched a brief video of a man stealing a laptop from an office. Twelve hours later, they were asked to identify him from a line-up. Half had slept during this time, but, contrary to expectations, they were no more accurate than the others at picking out the perpetrator. More work is needed to try to clarify why not.</p>
<p><strong>Effects can be indirect</strong></p>
<p>No doubt you’ve heard that a lack of sleep isn’t just bad for your mental but your physical health. Women who get less sleep are indeed more likely to develop obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, for example. But the major reason for these effects seems to be indirect: women who sleep poorly <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014587">tend to make poorer food choices</a>, going for higher-calorie, energy-dense foods. These choices are certainly related to a lack of quality sleep, but they aren’t an inevitable result of it. The same team behind this finding suspect, meanwhile, that a poor diet can cause poor sleep: “It’s also possible that poor diet has a negative impact on women’s sleep quality”, notes lead author Faris Zuraikat, at Columbia University. “Eating more could also cause gastrointestinal discomfort, for instance, making it harder to fall asleep or remain asleep.”</p>
<p><strong>Some poor sleepers don’t suffer at all</strong></p>
<p>Just how bad is insomnia anyway…? There are a lot of people out there who technically do suffer from insomnia, but who don’t believe, or realise, that they do, and these people experience no distress or anxiety, and are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/26/insomnia-identity-misbelieving-youve-got-sleep-problems-can-be-more-harmful-than-actual-lack-of-sleep/">no more impaired in terms of daily fatigue than those who get good sleep</a>. What’s more, a massive increase in hypertension (high blood pressure) was observed among those who regarded themselves as having insomnia, but not among the “non-complaining poor sleepers”. The same review found that 37% of people who think they have insomnia actually sleep normally, and having an “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796717301638?via=ihub">insomnia identity</a>” was more predictive of daytime impairment than poor sleep. Other research has found, meanwhile, that worrying about not getting enough sleep can itself lead to prolonged insomnia.</p>
<p><span>Headlines that make people worry that they’re not getting enough sleep could themselves, then, cause some of the problems they’re describing. Which brings me back to the start of this feature…. There’s plenty of evidence that a good quantity of regular quality sleep is important. But how we think about the way we sleep is important, too.</span></p>

<p>The Great Recession of 2008 was characterized by an economic and financial crisis with a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), high levels of unemployment, and a great impact on European countries and worldwide. Austerity measures taken by governments as a response to this crisis were characterized by reducing social spending and increasing taxation, although they were neither homogeneous nor similarly implemented at European level; some countries protected public sector programs and systems while others instituted large budget cuts in education, healthcare, and other public services. There was general agreement that some countries such as Greece, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom applied higher levels of austerity. These measures taken by governments would have an impact on the most vulnerable groups, mainly children and youth from disadvantaged families.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08732-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">We conducte<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11883 alignleft" height="212" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/financial-crisis-544944_640-300x212.jpg" width="300" />d a systematic literature review</a> to assess the impact of austerity measures taken by European governments on social determinants of child health, and child health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Our results</strong></p>
<p>The countries that applied high austerity levels showed an increase in material deprivation, child poverty rates, and low birth weight, compared to the pre-austerity period. Higher levels of social protection spending in the period 2008–2013 were associated with lower levels of child poverty. High austerity was reported also to be related to poorer access to and quality of services provided, mainly to disabled children. Reduction of public health expenditure was associated with a reduction of specific vaccination coverage in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>Austerity and COVID-19</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health in the long run</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time when we carried out the review, we had not predicted the current COVID-19 pandemic. Early data suggests, unsurprisingly, that the pandemic is impacting the poor and vulnerable most, with stark socio-economic and ethnic inequalities in outcomes.  Although there are still many uncertainties regarding the pandemic, it seems that children are less prone to severe consequences of infection compared to adults. However, it is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health, particularly poor children, in the long run.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11884" height="216" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/children-63175_640-300x216.jpg" width="300" />In the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, key components of preventive child health services have been negatively affected, e.g. immunization. The unintended consequences of lockdown measures and social distancing are disproportionately affecting poor children, increasing hunger, mental health problems and the risk of abuse, neglect and non-accidental injury. Especially, closure of schools and (day)care facilities may have contributed to lower ‘visibility’ of neglect and domestic violence. In the long run, sustained austerity measures to be expected after the acute phase will damage the capacity of social welfare and health systems to respond.</p>
<blockquote><p>We recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent the negative consequences of austerity measures</p></blockquote>
<p>On the basis of our review, we hypothesize that those areas and countries that applied less austerity measures are in a better condition to respond to the healthcare and social needs of both children and the general population. Moreover, we recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent such negative consequences of austerity measures. In the near future important research challenges will be to see if the countries with fewer cuts in expenditure on public healthcare and social services are better able to protect health and well-being of children and families, especially in disadvantaged populations, from the consequences of the pandemic.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people">Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine stimulates an immune response in people</a></h4>

<p>An experimental vaccine may help protect
against a coronavirus infection, preliminary results from people and mice
suggest.</p>



<p>One or two doses of an mRNA vaccine prod
people’s bodies to <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine">make
as many or more antibodies against the coronavirus</a> as are made by people
who have recovered from COVID-19, researchers from Moderna, Inc., announced May
18. </p>



<p>Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., and
the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda,
Md., <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">worked
together</a> to develop the vaccine, known as mRNA-1273 (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). </p>



<p>Their approach uses messenger RNA, or
mRNA, a genetic molecule that cellular machinery reads in order to build
proteins. In this case, the mRNA contains instructions for building the
coronavirus’ spike protein, which helps the virus enter human cells. The
vaccine induces human cells to make the spike protein. The immune system then makes
antibodies to latch onto the spike proteins. Should a vaccinated person
encounter the virus later, those vaccine-stimulated antibodies may prevent the
virus from infecting healthy cells.</p>





<p>Mice vaccinated with these mRNAs were
protected against lung infection when researchers later exposed the rodents to SARS-CoV-2,
the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, the researchers also report. None of the
data has been reviewed by independent scientists, and has not yet been made
publicly available.</p>





<p>The new data “give us confidence that
mRNA-1273 has a high probability of providing protection against COVID-19
disease in humans,” said Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer at Moderna. </p>



<p>Researchers in Seattle and Atlanta began
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-volunteer-sophia-upshaw">injecting
human volunteers</a> with the experimental vaccine in March (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). This first phase of
testing was designed to determine safety, help researchers determine what dose
to use, and to measure people’s immune response. </p>



<p>The study tested three doses: 25
micrograms, 100 micrograms and 250 micrograms. People in each dosage group got
an initial injection, followed a month later by a booster shot. Although 45
people participated in the study (15 in each group), antibody results for only the
first four people in the 25-microgram and 100-microgram groups are available.
Some preliminary results for people in the 250-microgram group were also
reported. </p>



<p>Levels of antibodies called neutralizing
antibodies, which can block the coronavirus from infecting human cells,
measured two weeks after the booster shot were equivalent between the 25-microgram
vaccine group and in people who had recovered from a COVID-19 infection. Levels
of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of the 100-microgram group were even
higher than in people who had recovered from the disease. </p>



<p>“These data are extremely promising, but they are
in eight people,” says Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University in
Madison, N.J. “I agree with Moderna and NIAID that they should keep going” with
the vaccine, she says. “But I don’t know that we fully know yet that this is
going to be a home run.”</p>

<p>Other scientists also say that the available data
are too minimal to draw firm conclusions. Neutralizing antibody levels in blood
can vary widely, says Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at the Rockefeller University
in New York City. “So when Moderna says ‘levels matching or exceeding the level
found in [recovered people],’ that’s almost meaningless.” And no one yet knows
what level of antibody production is necessary for protection in people, nor
how long such protection might last.</p>



<p>The study measured only one type of immunity, that
produced by neutralizing antibodies. The researchers didn’t measure whether
other immune cells called T cells also rev up virus defenses in response to the
vaccine, Barker says. Such T cells may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-t-cells-patients-immune-system">protect
people from developing severe cases</a> of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 5/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>One person in the 100-microgram group
developed redness at the injection site, and three people in the 250-microgram
group developed some severe flulike symptoms, including muscle aches, headache
and fatigue, after the second injection. Those symptoms are probably
indications that the immune system is responding to the vaccine, said Tal Zaks,
Moderna’s chief medical officer, during a May 18 briefing with reporters and
investors.</p>



<p>But those symptoms could be cause for
concern. The injection site redness was classified as severe, or grade 3.
That’s a red spot 10 centimeters in diameter, says Mark Slifka, a viral
immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. The next
step is death of the tissue. Milder side effects are typically common with
vaccines, “but if there are a consistent number of grade 3s, that’s a concern
for a vaccine you want to use broadly.”</p>

<p>The company has already gotten
permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to go ahead with the
second phase of human safety tests. The company will eliminate the
250-microgram-dose arm and add a 50-microgram group. Lower doses may offer
equal protection against the virus and stretch limited supplies of the vaccine,
Zaks said.</p>



<p>The initial tests were in people 18 to
55 years old. The next phase of testing will also include people 56 to 70 years
old, and an over-70 group.</p>



<p>A much larger third phase of testing,
which would continue safety testing and measure antibody responses, will also
determine whether the antibodies actually protect against infection. That phase
may begin as <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-receives-fda-fast-track-designation-mrna-vaccine-mrna">early

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-lunar-exploration-cement-urine-urea-3d-printing">Astronauts may be able to make cement using their own pee</a></h4>

<p>Future astronauts could make
lunar buildings out of moon dust and pee.</p>



<p>That’s the suggestion of
chemist Anna-Lena Kjøniksen and her colleagues, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619340478?via%3Dihub">who made a cement from urea</a> — a major component of urine — and faux lunar soil.</p>



<p>When humans take up
long-term residence on other planets or the moon, they will need to pack light,
in part because shipping materials from Earth is expensive. NASA has estimated
that every pound of material sent into orbit around the Earth costs around
$10,000.</p>



<p>Tapping into local resources
could keep costs down. Researchers have suggested using lunar soil to make
concrete or cement to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-d-printing-revolution">3-D print dwellings for astronauts</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/13</em>). But most cement recipes require
a lot of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-showers-dig-water-moon-nasa">water, which is scarce on the moon</a> and awfully heavy to blast into space (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>).</p>





<p>On Earth,
adding a chemical called a superplasticizer to a cement mix reduces the amount
of water needed by keeping a drier mix from getting too crumbly, while leaving
it flexible enough to be used in a 3-D printer. But most superplasticizers are
organic compounds, also in short supply on the moon, says Kjøniksen, of Østfold University College in Halden, Norway.</p>



<p>Then it
hit her. “I was thinking, what’s available on the moon? If you add humans, then
what do you have available?” she says. Maybe human waste could turn into
something useful.</p>



<p>Kjøniksen
had previously used urea to make plastic mixtures less viscous. Urea breaks
hydrogen bonds between molecules, reducing friction and letting the molecules
slide past each other more easily. She’d never heard of someone using it in
cement, “but I thought it was worth a try.”</p>



<p>A silica
and aluminum oxide powder — a stand-in for lunar dust — is the main ingredient
in Kjøniksen’s cement. Its chemical content is similar to fly ash, the main
component of common cement mixtures, but with larger and more crystalline
grains. The team mixed that powder with powdered urea bought from a chemical
supply company, not distilled from real urine, along with some water to make
the cement. Compared with two other superplasticizers used in construction on
Earth, “the urea worked very well,” Kjøniksen says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="sample structures 3D-printed with cement" class="wp-image-3088101" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051520_lg_astronaut-pee_inline_680-616x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088101">Scientists 3-D printed these miniature walls with a cement containing urea — the second most abundant compound in human urine — and simulated lunar dust. Future astronauts could use a similar mixture to build their own habitats, the researchers say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088101">© S. Pilehvar, ESA</span></figure>



<p>The
mixture held its shape under light weight and withstood temperature changes. Extruding
the cement through a tube and stacking several layers on top of each other using
a 3-D printer made a tiny, stable wall, the team reported in the Feb. 20 <em>Journal
of Cleaner Production</em>.</p>



<p>Kjøniksen
plans to test the cement in more extreme temperatures and in a vacuum chamber
that mimics the moon’s lack of atmosphere. Then, the next step would be scaling
the wall up to a more realistic size. She also wants to investigate whether
future astronauts would have to purify urine, or if they could use pee in
cement directly. </p>



<p>In real
life, making urea cement will probably be more complicated than just peeing in
a bucket, says materials scientist Belinda Rich of the European Space Agency in
Noordwijk, the Netherlands, who was not involved in this study but is working
with Kjøniksen and colleagues on follow-up experiments. But overall, making
cement with urea on the moon could be practical, she says.</p>



<p>“It sounds like such a daft idea,” Rich says. “But here we are — it works.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-ancient-plagues-pandemics-lessons-society">Past plagues offer lessons for society after the coronavirus pandemic</a></h4>

<p>It was an optimistic time. A healthy economy showered wealth
on elites and allowed many ordinary citizens to live comfortably. Local goods and
exotic imports filled shops and markets. Political leaders ruled a vast network
of cities and trade routes.</p>



<p>Then the enemy attacked. An infectious disease leapfrogged
from one population center to another. People died in droves. Political leaders
scrambled to recover from a dizzying sucker punch to public and economic health.</p>



<p>This is not a tale about the United States or any other
nation besieged by the new coronavirus. Instead, it’s a story about the ancient
Roman Empire, where a contagion known as the Antonine Plague felled victims throughout
the realm, from Egypt to continental Europe and the British Isles in the late
160s.</p>



<p>Accurate mortality data for the Antonine Plague don’t exist.
But written accounts from that time point to mass deaths. Physician and
philosopher Galen described victims as suffering from open sores in the
windpipe, rashes of dark blisters, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and other symptoms
of what may have been smallpox. Perhaps 7 million to 8 million people perished
in what some consider to be history’s first pandemic, says Kyle Harper of the
University of Oklahoma in Norman. Harper is a historian of the Roman Empire and
ancient epidemics.</p>





<p>The Antonine Plague and other epidemics and pandemics that struck
before 20th century vaccines and medical knowledge hold lessons, but no easy
answers, for governments and people today grappling with COVID-19.</p>



<p>One lesson looms large: Societies can’t indefinitely avoid
outbreaks, but they can withstand even severe pandemics. Past political systems
have found ways to bounce back from mass illness and unthinkable numbers of deaths.</p>



<p>The extent to which deadly outbreaks have altered the course
of civilizations is controversial, though. Some scholars, such as Harper,
contend that pandemics often changed political systems in big ways. Other
investigators argue that pandemics, though deadly, caused relatively little
political and economic havoc. </p>



<p>Whatever the political and economic fallout, pandemics and
epidemics have typically had social consequences, for better or worse. For
instance, devastating yellow fever outbreaks in the 19th century bolstered the
institution of slavery in New Orleans, whereas in Haiti the disease actually
helped slaves seeking freedom from French colonists.</p>



<p>“Sometimes [infectious diseases] accelerate history or
reveal where a society was already going, while sometimes they fundamentally
change the trajectory of societies,” Harper says.</p>





<h4>Diseased empire</h4>



<p>Sometimes pandemics do both in the same society. Widespread
infectious disease influenced both the expansion and decline of the Roman
Empire, Harper argues. In his 2017 book <em>The
Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease and the End of an Empire</em>, he contends that pandemics
interacted with climate fluctuations to induce resilience at first and later
irreversible weaknesses in the Roman Empire.</p>



<p>Humans of course suffered from infectious diseases well
before Roman times. In particular, the origin of cities, starting about 6,000
years ago, brought people into closer quarters, where bacteria and viruses
could more easily spread, especially through contaminated food and water
supplies in a time before proper sanitation. </p>



<p>But it wasn’t until the rise of Rome that the elements
needed to bring about pandemics appear to have come together for the first time.
Population growth and long-distance trade in the Roman Empire proved a boon to
diseases that jumped from animals to people, such as smallpox and measles. </p>



<p>The Antonine Plague struck during the reign of Marcus
Aurelius in the late 160s. Though millions died, the empire was big enough to
absorb those losses, which still left roughly 90 percent of the empire’s
population intact, Harper says. Political reorganization and power sharing were
required to counteract food shortages and an economic decline in the wake of the
pandemic. Marcus Aurelius invited civic leaders from throughout the empire to
join his imperial government. Their wealth and knowledge helped Roman elites to
improve conditions in the empire’s provinces, and provincial governments were
given greater power to resolve local issues.</p>



<p>Roman society rebounded, at least for a while. </p>

<p>Then, in the mid-200s, a poorly understood pestilence known
as the Plague of Cyprian swept through the Roman Empire. Eyewitness accounts,
including that of the disease’s namesake, Cyprian the Bishop of Carthage,
described painful deaths preceded by days of fatigue, bloody stool, fever,
bleeding from the eyes, blindness and hearing loss. An influenza virus or a
viral hemorrhagic fever similar to yellow fever and Ebola may have caused this
deadly outbreak, Harper suspects.</p>



<p>Combined with drought, foreign invasions, infighting among
generals and a rapid loss of coin values, the Plague of Cyprian brought the
Roman Empire to its knees. For over a decade, the disease spread and likely
killed a larger percentage of the population than the Antonine Plague had,
Harper says, though precise numbers are hard to establish. As the central
government reeled, a series of emperors were chosen — and sometimes quickly
deposed — by the military based on an aspiring ruler’s popularity with generals.
But the empire never regained its former prominence, Harper says. </p>

<p>By the early 400s, the western half of the Roman Empire gave
way to foreign invaders. In the east, the empire held on for a bit. But in the
mid-500s, an outbreak of bubonic plague known as the Justinianic Plague, caused
by the bacterium <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5000-year-old-mass-grave-harbors-oldest-human-plague-case"><em>Yersinia pestis</em></a><em> </em>(<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>), spread through Roman
territory just as volcanic eruptions caused substantially cooler global
temperatures, likely leading to lower Mediterranean crop yields, Harper
contends. Death rates likely reached 50 percent or more of the population, he
suspects. Soon after, the Roman Empire suffered military losses to Islamic
armies and was reduced to a minor state.</p>



<p>Rather than swiftly destroying the Roman realm, plague and
climate change “sapped the vitality of the empire,” Harper says.</p>



<h4>Political resilience</h4>



<p>Harper’s reconstruction of Roman history rings hollow to
environmental historian Merle Eisenberg. Even given large mortality rates, the
plagues that hit the Roman Empire had limited social and political fallout, Eisenberg,
of the University of Maryland’s National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center
in Annapolis, contends. </p>



<p>Written and archaeological <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/an-ancient-outbreak-of-bubonic-plague-may-have-been-exaggerated">data
recently analyzed by Eisenberg and colleagues</a> (<em>SN: 12/2/19</em>) indicate that life during the Justinianic Plague, for
instance, proceeded much as it had before the outbreak in some places. Roman
legislation continued to be issued, the monetary system remained stable and
farmland continued to be cultivated, as indicated by ancient pollen collected
from lake beds. “Plague certainly struck the Mediterranean, but it did not seem
to impact the lives of most people,” Eisenberg says.</p>



<p>If a majority of Roman subjects had died, there should have
been less time to bury plague victims with inscribed tombstones and less money
to erect new buildings with inscriptions detailing who built them and why. But
the number of such inscriptions in Syria, a region hit hard by the plague, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/51/25546">stayed stable during the
pandemic</a>, Eisenberg’s group reported in December in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences</em>. Eisenberg concludes that substantially less than half of the
Roman Empire’s population must have succumbed to the Justinianic Plague.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Yersinia pestis bacteria" class="wp-image-3088137" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051820_bb_pandemic-history_inline2_680_rev.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088137"><em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacteria (yellow in this scanning electron micrograph of the spines, purple, lining a flea’s digestive system) caused a series of plagues in Europe, including the Justinianic Plague in the Roman Empire [ok]and the medieval Black Death.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088137">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH</span></figure>



<p>That estimate is based on limited evidence that doesn’t tap
into the Justinianic Plague’s broad political and social effects across the
Roman Empire, Harper argues. But given considerable gaps in what’s known about
how that outbreak played out from one region to another, this debate will be
difficult to resolve. </p>



<p>For his part, Eisenberg says true devastation from a
pandemic didn’t arrive until the medieval Black Death, which killed perhaps 75
million to 200 million people — half of Europe’s population — from 1346 to
1351. Recurrences of the Black Death, caused by the same bacterium as the
Justinianic Plague, lasted until the 18th century in Europe and the 19th
century in the Middle East. But even the Black Death fell far short of causing
civilization to collapse, Eisenberg says.</p>



<p>Harper and other historians have suggested that the Black Death
spared so few farmers and other laborers that survivors successfully demanded
better working conditions from the ruling class. John Haldon, a Princeton
University historian of ancient Europe and the Mediterranean, agrees that mass
deaths spurred economic shifts, such as a gradual loosening of the feudal
system in which peasants received parcels of land in return for serving a lord
or king. “Yet there were no political collapses at all,” says Haldon, who
supervised Eisenberg’s graduate research but did not participate in his
Justinianic Plague study. Western European states and kingdoms stayed largely
intact during medieval times.</p>



<p>In modern times, better medical care and vaccines have
generally kept pandemic mortality rates below those suffered centuries ago. But
a modern, globalized world in which many nations are economically intertwined
and communications flash instantly across continents is especially vulnerable
to financial disruptions when pandemics strike, Eisenberg suspects. </p>



<p>“Premodern plagues generally caused more deaths than
infectious diseases today do,” he says. “But pandemics today, such as COVID-19,
have larger political and economic impacts than those in the past.”</p>



<p>From his perspective, history’s lesson for people now is to
stay vigilant: Once the coronavirus has been medically contained, the hard work
of dealing with the pandemic’s shocks to our way of life must accelerate.</p>





<h4>Certifiably immune</h4>



<p>Those shocks sometimes run deep. Unrelenting outbreaks of
infectious disease can modify an existing social order or even help to bring it
down, historians have found. </p>



<p>Consider yellow fever. The mosquito-borne viral disease
aided a successful rebellion of black slaves in Haiti against French colonial
rule. Yale University historian of science and medicine Frank Snowden describes
that event in his 2019 book <em>Epidemics and
Society: From the Black Death to the Present.</em></p>



<p>Haiti’s slave uprising lasted from 1791 to 1804. When
Napoleon sent more than 60,000 soldiers to put down the rebellion, many
European newcomers quickly succumbed to yellow fever because they lacked immunity
that black Haitians had already acquired. Yellow fever ended up helping Haiti’s
slaves win their freedom.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Haitian rebellion" class="wp-image-3088133" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050520_bb_pandemic-history_inline5_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088133">Previous exposure to yellow fever helped surviving Haitians launch a successful slave rebellion against French soldiers who lacked immunity to the infection. An 1802 battle in that struggle is illustrated here.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088133">Auguste Raffet/Wikimedia Commons</span></figure>



<p>The disease also thwarted Napoleon’s ambitions to expand his
empire into the Americas, Snowden says. In 1803, as a humiliating military
defeat fast approached in Haiti and prospects of war with Britain increased, the
cash-strapped French ruler sold Louisiana to the United States. That
transaction, which expanded slavery’s reach in the U.S. South, set the stage
for yellow fever to instigate entirely different social changes in 19th century
New Orleans.</p>



<p>Yellow fever killed more than 150,000 people there between
1803 and the Civil War’s start in 1860. No cure or vaccination existed for a
disease that killed about half of those it infected. Yellow fever deaths were
painful and horrifying. Many victims vomited thick, black blood before
succumbing after several days. Those who survived the infection became immune,
or what people at the time called “acclimated.”</p>



<p>In a city with stark divisions between rich and poor, men
and women and within racial groups — whites, “free people of color” and slaves
— acclimated citizens held special status, says Stanford University historian
Kathryn Olivarius. That immunity-based social system <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/124/2/425/5426380?redirectedFrom=fulltext">produced
New Orleans’ most powerful and wealthy families</a>, many of which are still
prominent, Olivarius concluded in the April 2019 <em>American Historical Review</em>. Her analysis included written accounts,
official documents and medical articles from the pre–Civil War era.</p>



<p>White people who survived yellow fever could receive a
certificate of acclimation, ensuring them access to good jobs, bank loans and
houses in the best neighborhoods. Many immigrants arriving in New Orleans in
the 1840s, especially Irish and Germans, saw infection as a path to success and
were willing to risk death to become acclimated.</p>

<p>Black people received no such benefits. Not only did the
slave economy withstand repeated epidemics, but resistance to yellow fever and
the likelihood of a long working life increased a slave’s monetary value to an
owner by 25 to 50 percent, Olivarius estimates.</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">someone
who recovers from COVID-19 gains immunity</a> (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>), as with yellow fever. Even so, possibly immune
individuals are drawing attention in this year of the coronavirus. Countries
such as Chile, Germany and the United Kingdom are considering issuing “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765836">immunity
passports</a>” — documents certifying that a person has recovered from COVID-19
— that would let these individuals go back to work early.  Immunity passports might become an
increasingly attractive strategy as it takes a year or more to develop a coronavirus
vaccine. “If so, we should heed lessons from the past and beware of potential
social perils,” Olivarius says.</p>



<h4>Forgetting pandemics</h4>



<p>A final lesson to glean from the past is perhaps the hardest
to follow: Don’t forget what happened. Don’t let the next generation forget,
either, because another outbreak will surely arrive when it is least expected.</p>



<p>Snowden observes that the influenza pandemic of 1918 and
1919, which killed an estimated 50 million people or more worldwide, was put
out of mind by many people soon after it burned out. “It’s curious how such a
major event could be so quickly forgotten,” Snowden said on April 2 during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30eayXdhYE">online interview</a> hosted
by <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists have warned for the last 20 years — as a series
of infectious diseases including SARS, MERS and Zika emerged — that new
pandemics and epidemics are on the horizon, Snowden said in the <em>JAMA</em> interview. Yet the United States
and other countries were woefully unprepared for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Perhaps pandemic forgetfulness is as contagious as
infectious diseases. In his 1722 book <em>A Journal
of the Plague Year</em>, Daniel Defoe, also the author of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, used historical accounts to construct a fictional
man’s experiences during an actual 1665 bubonic plague outbreak in London.</p>



<p>Defoe presents harrowing accounts of plague deaths and
forced isolation of the infected in their homes. Yet as infections waned,
people flocked into the streets and “cast off all apprehensions” when they
encountered individuals limping from plague-caused groin sores and exhibiting
other symptoms that “were frightful to the last degree, but the week before.”</p>



<p>In any age, a return to the soothing certainty of daily routines can help erase memories of having dodged a viral killer. Time will tell if this “viral amnesia” repeats itself when COVID-19 finally retreats.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Some attempted online scams are pretty obvious: those of us who are internet savvy, for example, are unlikely to reply to emails promising us millions of pounds worth of Bitcoin, no matter how often they land in our inbox.</p>
<p>Others, however, are harder to detect — and we may be overestimating our ability to do so, according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2020.1756240">new study</a> in <em>Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology </em>from E. Blair Cox and colleagues at New York University. It finds that people tend to believe they are less likely to fall for such scams than others, and that this assumption can actually put them at more risk.</p>
<p><span id="more-39620"></span><em> </em>First, 146 participants were presented with 12 phishing emails, based on real examples: one invited participants to test a new iPad, for example, whilst another said that the user’s Amazon password needed updating. Participants were either asked to indicate how likely <em>they</em> were to partake in the requested action (e.g. clicking a link or downloading an attachment), or how likely “someone like them” — a student of the same age and gender at the same university — would be to do so. In the first half of the experiment, participants were told the emails were phishing attempts, and in the second were told the emails were legitimate opportunities.</p>
<p>Participants also saw “base rates”: true percentages of a similar student population that had engaged in each behaviour, such as “37.3% of undergraduate students at a university clicked on a link to sign an illegal movie downloading pledge, because they thought they must in order to register for classes”.</p>
<p>When the emails were described as phishing attempts, participants predicted they were less likely to engage with the email than someone like them. Participants also showed no signs of using base rates to predict their own behaviour, while those who rated others’ behaviour did seem to use this figure as a guide. When told the emails were legitimate, there was no difference between the two groups. Two follow-up studies found the same results.</p>
<p>Next, the team looked at how (and how often) people use base rate information to make judgements about themselves and others, replicating the methods of the first three studies and adding eye gaze tracking. A total of 160 participants were presented with the same 12 phishing emails from the previous studies, and their eye movement was tracked as they estimated how likely they would be to engage with the emails. They were then asked to indicate how many times they had looked at the base rate information when considering their answers.</p>
<p>Again, participants believed they were less likely than others to fall for an online scam. And, as the eye tracking confirmed, they were also less likely to look at base rate information when considering their own choices, compared to when predicting someone else’s behaviour. However, they didn’t seem to be aware of this.</p>
<p>This, the team suggests, leaves many of us less than secure when it comes to our online lives: if we don’t take into consideration how often people fall for scams, we are unlikely to realise how susceptible we are ourselves. Companies may also do well to take heed — base rates are often shared with employees to encourage better security practices, but these results suggest that may not work. New approaches may be more successful.</p>
<p>There are also millions of people who don’t have digital literacy skills: in the UK alone, 8% of people (4.3 million) are <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/articles/exploringtheuksdigitaldivide/2019-03-04">estimated to have no basic skills at all</a>. But even if you are someone who knows their way around the internet — or even if you genuinely <em>are</em> unlikely to fall for a scam — the results are a reminder that it’s never good to make assumptions when thinking about our own vulnerabilities or assessing our levels of risk.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2020.1756240">Stuck on a phishing lure: differential use of base rates in self and social judgments of susceptibility to cyber risk</a></p>

<p>Less pizza
topping and more toothy hunter, ancient anchovy kin once had quite the bite. </p>



<p>Fossils show
that these fish were armed with <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.192260">a mouthful of fearsome teeth</a>. Each of the two newly analyzed
specimens sport spiky teeth along the lower jaw and one giant dagger jutting
down from the top jaw. Stranger still, the single sabertooth sits off-center. Such
chompers suggest that the now-extinct fish were predators, possibly feeding on
other fish, scientists report May 13 in <em>Royal
Society Open Science</em>.</p>



<p>Today’s
anchovies feast mostly on plankton. “They have super tiny teeth. They look
nothing like these things,” says paleontologist Alessio Capobianco of the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The ancient fish were also large compared
with their modern relatives, which top out at around 37 centimeters. One of the
fossil fish may have stretched nearly a meter long, the researchers estimate. </p>



<p>Using CT
scans to peer into the fossils, Capobianco and his team discovered shared
physical features that tie the ancient fish to their modern kin. Just like
today’s anchovies, which open wide to gulp food, these fossil fish had a gaping
maw, Capobianco says. “Probably that mouth opening helps to catch fish … because
those teeth are so large.” </p>



<p>The fossils,
which date from roughly 50 million years ago, are helping fill in a picture of
marine life during the Eocene Epoch. At that time, predatory fish like these
may have evolved to fill voids left by the massive extinction event that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-show-how-mass-extinction-scrambled-shark-evolution">wiped out the dinosaurs</a> along with many marine species about
66 million years ago (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>). </p>



<p>Fish from groups still around today, such as tuna, barracudas and mackerel, also swam the seas with the anchovies. “There were sort of failed experiments going on at the same time,” Capobianco says, including “these saber-toothed anchovies that didn’t survive to the modern day.”</p>

<br /><p>After the recent release of the <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro">Computational Neuroscience installable OS
image</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team
is looking to work on to the next set of deliverables. For this, we need to
expand the team.</p>
<p><em>I want to note that we are not only looking for people that may already have
the necessary skills. We are looking for anyone interested in working in these
areas that would perhaps like to acquire the required skills. We will teach the
skills that we can, and where we cannot, we will involve experienced members of
the Free/Open Source software community to help us. All one really needs is a
few hours a week of free time.</em></p>
<p>We are looking for people interested in:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scientific communication, marketing, outreach, and community engagement:<ul>
<li>To spread information on the staggering amount of Free/Open Source Software
that is available for Neuroscience to researchers and the community in
general,</li>
<li>To disseminate the progress that the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team makes regularly to
the community.</li>
<li>To just generally monitor our various communication channels to answer
queries and participate in discussions with the team and users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software development:<ul>
<li>There are still about <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues">200 tools</a> to include in
<a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, so still lots of work to do here. Some tools related to
computational neuroscience remain, so we are working on those. However, we
want to start making some headway on the next deliverable that will be
focussed on neuroimaging and data analysis. Not only do we need to build
these tools from source, we also need to test them regularly, and push new
versions to our users when developers make new releases.</li>
<li>We also want to provide easy to use containers for all the tools that we
are including in <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neuro-imaging and data analysis in Neuroscience:<ul>
<li>A lot of tools on our list are related to Neuro-imaging and data analysis.
To effectively integrate these with the rest of <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, we need more
people with domain knowledge. If you work these areas or want to work in
them and would like to learn more about these tools, <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is a
great informal environment to start in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common knowledge that joining Free/Open source communities is an excellent
way to pick up skills and experience. So, I especially encourage students to
join one, even if it is not <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>.</p>
<p>I also have first hand experience of how busy a PhD candidate can get, but in
my experience I also found it possible to free up a few hours a week to work on
developing general skills that one may not necessarily be able to learn from
daily research work. So, I also strongly encourage undergraduate/postgraduate
research students and Ph.D. candidates to do the same.</p>

<p>People infected with the
coronavirus carry immune cells known as T cells that help the body fight off
the infection, a study suggests. These cells may help people recover from
COVID-19, but their exact role is still unknown.</p>



<p>Researchers found <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3">T cells that target SARS-CoV-2</a>, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the blood of
people who had recovered from a coronavirus infection. Some people who had
never been exposed to the virus also had T cells that could recognize the virus,
researchers report May 14 in <em>Cell</em>.
That finding suggests that previous infections with other coronaviruses, like
the ones that cause common colds, could provide some level of protection
against the new coronavirus, such as keeping people from developing severe
disease.</p>



<p>It remains unclear whether these defenses can protect people from a reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and, if so, for how long.</p>



<p>A key part of the immune
system, T cells can recognize fragments of viruses. When the cells identify a
viral protein, helper T cells release chemical signals that trigger other parts
of the immune system to kick into gear. Others, called killer T cells, hunt
down and kill infected cells. </p>

<p>The team first predicted
which viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2 might represent the best target for T
cells to recognize. Then it mixed those viral fragments with immune cells
extracted from blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients who had recovered from
the disease as well as 11 healthy people. Those healthy people had participated
in unrelated studies from 2015 to 2018 — before the pandemic began — and could not have been previously exposed to
the coronavirus when their blood was sampled. </p>



<p>Around 70 percent of the
COVID-19 patients harbored the cell-killing T cells, and all carried helper T
cells. The immune cells recognized a variety of proteins from the coronavirus,
including ones that help it break into cells or coat its genetic material. </p>



<p>About half of the
healthy people also had helper T cells that recognized bits of SARS-CoV-2, and
about a third had the killer T cells. All of these people tested positive for
antibodies that attach to two coronaviruses that cause common colds, a sign the
participants had been previously infected by those viruses. </p>



<p>It’s “tempting to
speculate” that the cells could help people never exposed to the new
coronavirus, the researchers write. But to know for sure, experts would need to
test T cells from someone both before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scream-painting-munch-moisture-light-cadmium-deteriorating">Moisture, not light, explains why Munch’s ‘The Scream’ is deteriorating</a></h4>

<p>New
insight into paint preservation could help “The Scream” show its face in public
again.</p>



<p>Edvard
Munch’s 1910 version of this iconic artwork has rarely been displayed since
2006 because the painting’s cadmium sulfide pigments are so fragile. Cadmium
yellow brushstrokes in the sky and central figure have faded to off-white, and
thick paint in the lake is flaking off. To prevent further decay, the Munch
Museum in Oslo almost always keeps “The Scream” in storage, under carefully
controlled lighting and about 50 percent humidity. </p>



<p>Now, a
chemical analysis of the painting shows that <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/20/eeaay3514">moisture is the main reason for the
deterioration</a>,
while light plays only a minor role, Letizia Monico, a chemist at the Italian
National Research Council in Perugia, and her colleagues report online May 15
in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Researchers
analyzed microscopic flakes of paint from “The Scream” along with paint samples
with similar chemical composition that were artificially aged in the lab.  </p>



<p>X-ray probes
of the paint samples revealed cadmium sulfate, a breakdown product of cadmium
sulfide, in paint flecks from “The Scream.” Cadmium sulfate also showed up in
artificially aged paints that were exposed to at least 95 percent humidity in
both light and darkness,
but similar samples exposed to light in 45 percent humidity didn’t show signs
of decay. This suggests that moisture
is the main culprit in aging “The Scream,” and that although the painting may
be fine under normal lighting, it should be kept at 45 percent humidity or
below.</p>



<p>This new
understanding of the artwork may inform the preservation of other paintings by
Munch’s contemporaries, such as Matisse and van Gogh, which also contain decaying
cadmium sulfide pigments. But Monico cautions that every painting is a unique,
complex chemical landscape, so conservation strategies must be devised on a
case-by-case basis. </p>

<p><strong>Once again for <em><strong><em>Ra</em></strong></em></strong>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/once-again-ra"><em>Science News</em>, </a>May 16, 1970 – </p>



<p>Last year … a seven-man international crew was abandoning a disabled boat made of papyrus that in two months had taken them 2,700 miles westward in the Atlantic toward Mexico…. Nevertheless explorer-anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl, designer and pilot of the <em>Ra</em>, refused to admit defeat…. Late this week, Heyerdahl and his crew were awaiting suitable weather to set off on a second attempt at an Atlantic crossing. </p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>On July 12, 1970, Heyerdahl’s crew crossed the Atlantic in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/second-time-success">second papyrus vessel called <em>Ra II</em></a>. Heyerdahl wanted to show that ancient Egyptians could have reached the Americas centuries before Europeans did. No evidence of ancient New World Egyptians has been found. But the idea that early civilizations traveled long distances by sea was right. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-egyptian-blue-glass-beads-reached-scandinavia">Egyptian and Mesopotamian glass beads</a> reached southern Scandinavia via sea trade by around 3,400 years ago.

<p>Climate change is increasingly becoming part of
everyday conversations. For those who want to join the discussions, there is no
shortage of books that give detailed background and context on the subject. The
question is, which to read? </p>



<p><em>Science News </em>staff members have reviewed several books published this year to guide you
to which ones you might like. Many of these offerings address perhaps the most
press­ing question: With limited time to act, what’s the best way to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to avert the most dire impacts of climate change? </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3faA80i" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Future We Choose</a><br /><em>Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac<br />Knopf, $23</em></p>



<p>Four and a half years after 195 nations agreed
to limit global warming by 2100 to 2 degrees Celsius, the world <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">has
fallen behind</a> on its commitments (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>).
But all is not yet lost, two architects of the 2015 Paris Agreement argue in
this bracing call to arms aimed at those who fear it’s too late. Christiana
Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac paint two side-by-side visions of the world in
2050: a hot, pollution-choked hellscape rife with water wars and nationalist
paranoia, and a hopeful, forested world of high-speed trains, energy efficiency
and community-based agriculture. </p>



<p>Achieving that second future requires a mind-set
shift away from pessimism and the idea of resource availability as a zero-sum
game, Figueres and Rivett-Carnac say. They offer 10 general actions for readers
to take, including avoiding fossil fuels and engaging in politics. The final
chapter provides a template for actions readers can take today, this week and
all the way out to 2050. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3aLalZc" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Future Earth</a><br /><em>Eric Holthaus<br />HarperOne, $22.99</em></p>



<p>In this imagined history of the next 30 years,
meteorologist Eric Holthaus plots a path toward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-roadmap-shows-how-united-states-could-be-carbon-neutral-2050">zero
carbon emissions</a> (<em>SN:
1/31/20</em>). We won’t get there with solar panels and electric vehicles alone,
he says, criticizing those as market-based mechanisms that reinforce the status
quo. Instead, success requires a political and economic revolution. Holthaus
imagines natural disasters as catalysts for collective action, global systems
for climate migration and reparations, and economies driven by human need
rather than want. </p>





<p>Critics have long dismissed
such a vision, arguing that it would upend society, cost too much and require
an ambitious global agreement that seems politically impossible. But those
arguments ignore the fact that doing nothing to address climate change will be
even costlier and more politically damaging down the road, Holthaus says. (And
those criticisms may be crumbling now as the coronavirus pandemic shows
societies engaged in expensive and disruptive collective action for the public
good.) </p>



<p>The book ends with a series
of tips, exercises and checklists to help readers imagine this new future and
create their own action plans.</p>

<p>After running a campaign focused on climate change, Solomon
Goldstein-Rose was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in 2016 at the age
of 22. He served one term and then turned to climate activism full time. In
this concise book, he draws on his experiences to draft a five-pillar framework
for reaching negative carbon emissions by 2050.</p>



<p>Because most new emissions come from rapidly developing countries,
solutions must be economically viable for everyone, Goldstein-Rose points out.
He argues that a “World War II–style mobilization” of technology development
can get us there. Central to his plans, which he claims are feasible to achieve
in the next 30 years, are scaling up nuclear power, improving battery storage
and rolling out “greener” industrial processes. </p>

<p>If thinking
about climate change makes you (a) depressed, (b) worried, (c) guilty or (d)
all of the above<em>, </em>this book<em> </em>might be for you. Drawing on her expertise as an environmental
humanities scholar, Sarah Jaquette Ray outlines how environmentally conscious
citizens can cultivate a healthy mind-set and strong interpersonal
relationships for taking action on climate change. </p>



<p>To
deal with climate change–related fear and sadness, she suggests mindfulness
practices. To avoid burnout, she advocates setting attainable goals, like
reducing personal emissions or collaborating on environmental projects
with local community members.</p>



<p>Emotional
intelligence is important for engaging with other people’s feelings about
climate change, too. Ray reminds readers that people react to information based
more on how they feel about the messenger than the message. So prioritize
building trust and common ground — perhaps by focusing on local issues or
framing climate change as a public health problem — over simply winning
debates with skeptics. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/35dEcZ3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Story of More</a><br /><em>Hope Jahren<br />Vintage, $15</em></p>



<p>Paleobiologist Hope Jahren’s succinct
examination of “how we got to climate change” is both sweeping and
straightforward. Ranging across human history, and everywhere from Mesopotamia
to Minnesota, the book explores how the same ingenuity and industrious spark
that has allowed humans to squeeze ever more food and energy from the Earth
also set the stage for the current climate crisis. </p>



<p>Jahren relays the enormous scale
of human consumption conversationally: “Since 1969 the nations of the globe
have burned enough coal to fill a grave the size of Texas.” But she’s frank
about who exactly is responsible for the lion’s share of this consumption and
its consequences. Again and again, she ties the developed world’s insatiable
thirst for more to our imperiled planet. </p>



<p>The end of the book touches on several big
interventions that might curb climate change, such as mass tree planting or
geoengineering, but Jahren argues these won’t fix the root cause of climate
change: overconsumption. So she offers practical actions individuals can take
that all fall under the umbrella of using less and sharing more.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2yVubnm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Beyond Global Warming</a><br /><em>Syukuro Manabe and Anthony J. Broccoli<br />Princeton Univ., $35</em></p>



<p>In 1894, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius
made a startling announcement. His calculations suggested that a two- or
threefold increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide could alter global
temperatures on a scale comparable to the difference between cold glacial and
warm interglacial periods.  </p>



<p>Climate scientists have since devised <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">increasingly
complex models</a> to understand humans’ impact on
climate, weaving together observations and equations to simulate changes on
land, in the oceans and in the atmosphere (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). Climate modeler
Syukuro Manabe and atmospheric scientist Anthony J. Broccoli describe the
evolution of these models.</p>



<p>Packed with data and graphs, and based on a graduate course taught by Manabe, the book is not a light read. But it gives an in-depth, science-rich understanding of this crucial field. </p>

<p>The
parasites that cause malaria may march to the beat of their own drum. </p>



<p>New
genetic analyses suggest that <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba2658">possess their own circadian
rhythms</a>,
and don’t depend on a host for an internal clock, researchers report May 15 in <em>Science</em>. Figuring out how <em>Plasmodium</em>’s clock ticks may lead to ways to
disrupt it, potentially adding
to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/compounds-defeat-malaria-every-step">growing arsenal of
treatments for malaria</a> (<em>SN: 11/27/13</em>). In 2018, the mosquito-borne
illness <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/malaria/index.html">sickened an
estimated 228 million people worldwide</a> and caused more than 400,000 deaths.</p>



<p>A
malarial infection is a series of cyclical symptoms. Depending on the <em>Plasmodium</em> species involved, fever and
chills return roughly every 24, 48 or 72 hours, thanks to the parasites’
synchronized reproduction within and destruction of a host’s red blood cells. </p>



<p>Researchers had long thought that the rhythmic nature of an infection was likely driven by a host’s circadian rhythms, says molecular parasitologist Filipa Rijo-Ferreira, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute associate at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Circadian clocks help organisms anticipate regular, cyclic changes in their environment, like day and night cycles and daily fluctuations in temperature. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cracking-body-clock-code-wins-trio-nobel-prize">clocks are made up of genes and proteins that drive daily rhythms</a> (<em>SN: 10/2/17</em>), such as the release of hormones, and typically operate on 24-hour cycles in many animals. </p>





<p>Rijo-Ferreira
and colleagues recently showed that the <em>Trypanosoma</em> parasite behind the
illness known as sleeping sickness has its own internal clock. So the team
decided to look for a similar ability in <em>Plasmodium</em>. </p>



<p>The
scientists tracked rhythms of how genes were turned on and off in malaria
parasites in infected mice hosts. The researchers put some mice in constant
darkness, eliminating day and night cues and throwing off the animals’
circadian rhythms. But the timing of changes in the parasites’ gene activity
levels in those mice was similar to that of mice exposed to regular day-night
cycles.  </p>



<p>Next,
to see if the parasites used a host’s feeding schedule to orient their clock,
the team provided mice with food spread evenly throughout the day. But the <em>Plasmodium</em>
in those mice kept the same internal rhythms as those in mice that were fed
once daily. </p>



<p>And
when the parasites were in hosts engineered to lack a clock entirely, the
pathogens’ timekeeping ability ticked right along unhindered. These findings reveal
that the light and feeding cues that set the hosts’ clocks don’t affect
parasites’ rhythms, suggesting that the parasite has its own independent clock.</p>



<p>What’s
more, in mutant mice genetically engineered to have a circadian clock slightly
longer than 24 hours, the parasites attempted to synchronize their own clocks to
that of their host’s, slowing their pace. While malaria parasites can
parallel their host’s schedule, they don’t depend on their host for a clock,
the team concludes, suggesting that the parasites use their own clocks to align
with the host’s during an infection. </p>



<p>But
while individual <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites appear to have an internal clock
independent of a host’s, syncing up all the clocks in a population of parasites
inside of a host does apparently require input from the host’s rhythms, the
researchers say. In mice lacking an internal clock, the synchrony within an entire
parasite population slowly decayed, falling apart after eight or nine days.
This is similar to what happens to internal clocks in groups of mammalian cells
without any external cues, such as sunlight or chemicals.</p>



<p>“That
is quite reassuring, because we really think that [<em>Plasmodium</em>’s clock]
behaves just as another circadian system that we know very well,” Rijo-Ferreira
says. </p>



<p>Rijo-Ferreira
says she wasn’t surprised by the findings, given how many times internal clocks
have independently evolved in nature in organisms ranging from bacteria to fungi
to animals. “It’s almost unbelievable that an organism wouldn’t have a clock,” she says.</p>



<p>Further
support for <em>Plasmodium</em>’s internal clock comes from a separate study, also
in the May 15 <em>Science</em>, led
by molecular biologist Steven Haase at Duke University. Haase and his team
isolated a species of <em>Plasmodium</em> entirely from a host, growing four
different strains of the parasite in the lab. They tracked the parasites’
patterns of gene activity levels too, finding that as much as 92.6 percent of
the known genes for <em>Plasmodium </em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba4357">appear to be clock
controlled</a>,
keeping time in the absence of a host. </p>



<p>Now
that the existence of some kind of clock is confirmed, Haase says, the next
steps are revealing its molecular underpinnings, and how the clock interacts
with that of the host. </p>



<p>Uncovering “the components of the parasite’s timekeeping mechanism” could help determine if, in fact, the parasites have their own independently and consistently ticking clock, says Sarah Reece, an evolutionary parasitologist at the University of Edinburgh not involved with either study. While the findings suggest that some form of clock is at work here, “it’s still possible [the parasites] keep time in a simpler way,” she says, for instance reacting to some other external stimuli.</p>

Choosing the ‘right’ minimum legal age for legalized non-medical cannabis</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/cannabis-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>An increasing number of jurisdictions including Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Luxembourg and several US states are looking to legalize non-medical cannabis. The decision to legalize cannabis however comes with a contentious question for policymakers: What should be the minimum legal age (MLA) for cannabis consumption? While a low MLA can discourage the underground cannabis market, cannabis consumption before age 25 is said to negatively impact brain development. Policymakers, thus, face a difficult tradeoff between curtailing illegal economic activity and safeguarding adolescents’ well-being.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08639-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> shows that there is merit in choosing 19 as the MLA for non-medical cannabis use. We reached this conclusion by looking at how Canadians, who started using cannabis at different young ages, differ in several important outcomes (educational attainment, cigarette smoking, self-reported general and mental health) later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this study?</strong></p>
<p>Canada was the second country in the world to legalize non-medical cannabis in October 2018. Ahead of the legalizatio<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11887 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/marijuana-300x200.jpg" width="300" />n, the federal government recommended a MLA of 18 years. However, after public consultations and for harmonization with the existing minimum legal ages for alcohol and tobacco use, most Canadian provinces set 19 as the minimum legal age; the two exceptions were Quebec and Alberta which opted for 18. Two years into legalization, the policy on MLA for cannabis use in Canada is still evolving. In particular, Quebec revised its MLA to 21 in October 2019 and there have also been calls to raise minimum legal age to 21 in Ontario. Notably, evidence that could shed light on the merits of different proposed MLAs was lacking.</p>
<p><strong>What do our findings imply?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Individuals starting cannabis at age 19 have later life outcomes that are better than those starting it ate age 18</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that most later life outcomes are better for individuals starting cannabis at age 19 than those starting it at age 18 but not worse than those starting cannabis between age 20 and 25. These results imply that age 19 is the optimal MLA for cannabis use.</p>
<p>This finding of MLA of 19 is different from the Canadian federal government’s recommendation of 18 and stands in contrast with medical community’s support for age 21 or 25. Yet, it appears to be plausible: age 19 is high enough to address concerns over potential adverse outcomes associated with using cannabis at young age while low enough to discourage the illegal market for the underage.</p>
<p>Our findings will be useful for policymakers in jurisdictions planning to legalize non-medical cannabis. Meanwhile, in Canada, as the post-cannabis legalization era evolves, it will be important to watch trends in youth’s and young adults’ use and monitor harms over time while ensuring that the legal market is tightly regulated and that cannabis companies do not stray from restrictions on marketing, sales, and packaging that might make products more appealing and accessible to children.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>It’s hard to find a clearer example of moral hypocrisy than this: in 2015, Josh Duggar, a family values activist and director of a lobby group set up “to champion marriage and family as the foundation of civilisation, the seedbed of virtue, and the wellspring of society” was outed as holding an account with a dating service for people who are married or in relationships.</p>
<p>As Kieran O’Connor at the University of Virginia and colleagues point out in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-28138-001">new paper</a> in the J<em>ournal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition,</em> Duggar’s apparently virtuous public image was in stark contrast to his private behaviour. This was a classic case, then, of hypocrisy. But as the team now reveal through a compelling series of seven studies, another type of discrepancy is seen as being hypocritical too. That’s when individuals are perceived to use private <em>good</em> deeds to assuage their guilt over morally dubious public works.</p>
<p><span id="more-39603"></span>In expanding understanding of what constitutes hypocrisy, the work has practical as well as theoretical applications. As the researchers observe: “Understanding how people think about hypocrisy is important because individuals and organisations suffer severe consequences when they are perceived as hypocritical.” A scandal that involves hypocrisy is extra damaging for a politician or an organisation, the team points out.</p>
<p>The initial studies dug into the circumstances in which we judge inconsistencies in people’s behaviour as hypocritical. In one study, for instance, 317 participants of more than 60 different nationalities (all living in London) each read three vignettes about organisations that cause harm, and people publicly associated with them who acted virtuously in private. In some cases, these private acts seemed inconsistent with the individual’s public behaviour. In others, they did not. For example, a vignette featuring a factory farm that abused animals was tweaked into two different versions, so that an employee made anonymous, lump-sum donations to improve animal welfare, or donated to help high-school students instead. The participants were asked to what extent, in each case, the behaviour was hypocritical.</p>
<p>The results showed that being bad-in-public but good-in-private <em>is</em> perceived as hypocrisy. And when  good private behaviour was inconsistent with an individual’s public role, they were seen as more hypocritical than when that behaviour was completely unrelated . So a donation by a tobacco industry employee to a fund for lung-cancer research was regarded as being more hypocritical than a donation by the same individual to an animal welfare charity, for example.</p>
<p>In another study, 409 online participants each read excerpts of similar case studies. As before, they rated the featured individual’s hypocrisy. But this time, they also rated the extent to which they felt the individual was using private virtuous behaviour to try to alleviate their guilt, and completed a questionnaire assessing how praiseworthy they felt the individual to be.</p>
<p>The team found that good private behaviour that was inconsistent with their public role (rather than simply unrelated to it) made the individual appear more motivated by guilt, which in turn predicted higher hypocrisy ratings. And, in turn, this predicted lower praise for his good deeds.</p>
<p>A final study on 1,275 English-speaking participants living outside the US found that the extent to which an individual <em>successfully</em> reduced their guilt was important for perceptions of hypocrisy. In this case study, a man who experienced guilt at selling harmful opioids was reported as feeling prompted to make a donation to the arts. When this brought “no relief”, he was perceived as being less hypocritical than when this private act was said to have fully cleansed his conscience. The participants also reported that, in this second version, he felt better than he deserved to feel, and rated him as being significantly less praiseworthy. As the researchers write, “At least in this context, using good deeds to alleviate your guilt was tantamount to claiming an undeserved moral benefit.”</p>
<p>This work shows that people conceptualise hypocrisy more broadly than had been thought, write O’Connor and his team. It also provides clear evidence for one of two competing theories of hypocrisy: that it relates to perceptions of undeserved benefits (rather than, as has also been suggested, the sending of false signals to others).</p>
<p>More work is now needed to explore whether more drastic private virtuous actions — giving away one’s entire wealth to fund a new museum, perhaps, rather than merely making “a donation” — might be deemed to compensate for at least certain types of morally dubious public behaviour.</p>
<p>As the researchers write, “The question of what behaviors will convince observers that a clear conscience does not imply hypocrisy must await future research.”</p>

<p>This summer, the arXiv development team will begin work on the next major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which will be based on the official <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> update. TeX is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.</p>
<p>This year’s update will provide enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team will also use this opportunity to address outstanding bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.</p>
<p>arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new TeX Live release is expected to become available Fall 2020.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>The way parents feel and behave often rubs off on their children. Kids’ own life paths can be influenced by the strength of their parents’ <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/24/the-quality-of-the-relationship-between-parents-can-shape-their-childrens-life-paths/">romantic relationship</a>, for example, or <u><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/">how often their parents lie to them.</a></u></p>
<p>We may also pick things up as our parents try to hide them, as <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000664">new research</a> published in the <em>Journal of Family Psychology </em>suggests. Even when parents try to hide their stress, the team finds, they can still pass on those feelings to their children anyway.</p>
<p><span id="more-39598"></span>To examine how stress is passed on from parent to child, Sara Waters from Washington State University Vancouver and colleagues looked at the physiological responses that occur when parents suppressed their anxiety. A total of 107 parents and their children aged between 7 and 11 were first fitted with ECG sensors to measure the heart’s  “pre-ejection period” (PEP), a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation, before spending five minutes listening to soothing music through headphones.</p>
<p>Parents were then separated from their children and completed a stress test, in which they were asked to give a five minute speech about themselves and then answer five minutes of questions in front of two evaluators. During the test, evaluators provided negative, non-verbal feedback, shaking their heads, crossing their arms and frowning.</p>
<p>The stressed-out parents were then assigned to either a “suppression” or control condition, before being reunited with their children. Those in the suppression condition were asked to mask their emotion, behaving in such a way that their child would not be able to know they were feeling anything at all, while those in the control condition were told to act naturally, as they would at home. Parent and child were then asked to engage in a six minute conversation about a source of conflict in their relationship, a six minute cooperation task in which they built with blocks, and six minutes of free play.</p>
<p>Trained observers who rated these interactions found that parents and children were less warm and engaged with each other in the suppression condition. There was also a significant link between a mother’s physiological stress and that of her child: mothers’ PEP reactivity at one time point was related to children’s reactivity shortly thereafter. In the control group, however, stress was not transmitted from mother to child.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, stress wasn’t transmitted from fathers to their children, which the team believes is down to how men deal with stress outside of laboratory conditions. Because men are more likely to say they’re fine when they’re not, while women are more likely to show how they’re feeling, the team argues that children were more used to emotional suppression in their male caretakers and were therefore less affected. However, fathers in the suppression condition did become linked to their children’s physiology in the opposite direction: they picked up stress from their children, not the other way around.</p>
<p>As the study focused purely on pairings between a single child and parent, future research could focus on emotional suppression and stress in larger groups or family systems, exploring how a second parent, sibling or other family member affects this physiological link, for instance. Researchers could also examine the techniques that parents use in the control condition: their warm and engaging interactions may stem from specific, positive emotion regulation strategies rather than simply being the result of not suppressing their emotions.</p>
<p>Hiding stress from your children is entirely understandable — you may wish to protect them from negative feelings and see emotional suppression as the best way to do that. But, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/wsu-ein042020.php">as Waters says</a>, it may be more comforting for children “to have their feelings honoured” — listening to them honestly, rather than brushing over them altogether.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When my 9-year-old has his best friend over to play, the house is filled with the sound of giggles. Yes, this friend plays fair, is outgoing and shares my son’s interests. But he’s also good <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Any parent knows that kids this age are obsessed with having fun (something that’s in short supply for many home-schoolers right now). And yet “being fun” has been overlooked as an indicator of a child’s social status, argue the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12546">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality</em>. Their new studies are, they say, the first to establish it as a unique factor important for understanding social hierarchies among kids.</p>
<p><span id="more-39593"></span>Within groups of children, social status is fluid, note Brett Laursen at Florida Atlantic University and colleagues. So far, researchers have identified and studied two factors that are the main drivers of a child’s potentially fluctuating status: likeability and popularity.</p>
<p>There is some overlap between the two. Both involve being outgoing and prosocial, for instance. But there are also some differences. For example, a popular kid <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/">might sometimes be physically aggressive</a>. This can raise their social status while reducing their likeability.</p>
<p>However, being “fun to be with” is conspicuously missing from the list of traits associated with being well-liked or popular, the authors argue. And yet, as they note, having fun is not only intrinsically socially rewarding but could bring other benefits — fun experiences promote creativity, and being perceived as fun could protect a child from peer rejection.</p>
<p>To investigate this, the team devised two studies. The first was conducted on 611 school kids aged 9 to 12 in Colombia. These children were asked to identify up to four same-sex classmates who best fit descriptions of likeability, popularity, and also fun. (Fun was measured with two items: “It is fun to hang out with him/her” and “Someone you can have fun with at a party”.)</p>
<p>The children also named classmates who they thought best fit seven other categories: academic achievement, athleticism, justice (fairness), leadership, physical aggression, prosocial behaviour (eg. being compassionate and caring for others) and relational aggression.  These variables are known to correlate with likeablility and popularity, and the team thought they could potentially also correlate with fun.</p>
<p>The results showed positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity: children who received more likeability nominations, for example, also tended to receive more nominations for being fun and popular. These variables were also positively correlated with all the potential confounding variables, except physical and/or relational aggression, depending on the age group.</p>
<p>The researchers then turned to 662 children of the same ages at two schools in southern Florida, who completed a similar peer-nomination questionnaire to the previous study. To look at changes over time, the team also asked the kids to complete the task again eight weeks later. (Eight weeks might sound like a short period of time to adults, but, at more than half a typical UK term, it’s a substantial amount of time for a kid, the team argues.)</p>
<p>Again, there were positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity. But the team also found that being perceived as fun at the first time point predicted increases in popularity and likeability eight weeks later: higher initial fun ratings were linked to bigger increases in both these other measures.</p>
<p>In their statistical analysis, the team removed the contribution of the variables already known to influence likeability and popularity (such as pro-social behaviour, leadership, physical attractiveness and relational aggression). And they found that the associations between initial fun ratings and later changes in status remained. Being perceived as fun, then, seems to act an independent factor contributing to social status.</p>
<p>Laursen and colleagues also found that higher likeability and popularity scores at the first time point were linked to higher fun scores at the second, “suggesting that, in the eyes of peers, fun begets status and status begets fun”.</p>
<p>The study didn’t explore what makes for a fun kid. But the team suggests that such children are equipped with a “constellation of traits”. They are likely socially adept and benefit from “ego resilience” (characterised by high levels of extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low neuroticism). They’re also probably enthusiastic and excitable, but able to regulate these traits.</p>
<p>The team would now like to see much more work to explore “being fun”. “Anecdotally, we know that children are intensely focused on having fun,” they write. “Scholars should be similarly focused on understanding the contributions of fun to success in the peer social world.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></h4>

<p>“You never write…you never call….” The guilt-tripping mother is common stereotype in movies and TV. But how many adult children harbor feelings of guilt toward their aging parents? Who experiences this guilt, and why?</p><p>About one in five adult children experience feelings of guilt toward their ageing mothers, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 2,450 Dutch adults in 2015 who have a mother aged 55 or older. Feelings of guilt in the family have rarely been measured in a systematic fashion but researchers have long argued that guilt is not only something moral, but also a fundamental social emotion. Guilt refers to negative feelings that arise from having done something that is – or is perceived to be – wrong. Guilt is not the same as shame; guilt is the awareness that one has done something wrong, shame is the translation of that feeling to one’s self-image: the feeling of not being a good person. Guilt and shame are emotions that have been linked to depression and low self-esteem.</p><p>People who have negative feelings about their relationships with their mothers more often report feelings of guilt. Surprisingly, people who have both negative and positive feelings about their mothers have more guilt. This may be because children who have negative feelings about their mothers are afraid that this will hurt their mothers’ feelings. This fear of hurting a person is more difficult if one also cares about that other person. Most people have positive feelings about their mothers. However, cultural expectations about positive and warm relationships with mothers leave little room for irritation, anger, and embarrassment, and it is exactly when such feelings arise in a warm relationship that people may feel guilty.</p><p>Adult children are an important source of support for their ageing parents. However, even at older ages, parents continue to support their adult children. The flow of support does not necessarily shift from downward (from parents to children) to upward (from children to parents) with age and for that reason, some children with older parents may feel that they are not doing enough to help. Feelings of guilt are associated with a lack of reciprocity in the support relationship. The less support people give to their mother, in comparison to how much support they receive, the stronger the feelings of guilt. With an increasing number of ageing parents in most high-income societies, demand for social and practical support from children increases and this may create more occasion for guilt to develop. It also seems that children who have strong norms about what people should do for their parents feel guilty more often. People set high standards for themselves, which in turn may lead to a feeling of not having done enough.</p><p>It was expected that infrequent contact would be associated with guilt but while people who had only monthly contact with their mothers feel guiltier, people with less than monthly contact did not report significantly more guilt than those with weekly contact. That primarily the monthly-contact group feels more guilt fits with a pattern of a good relationship that carries a cultural expectation of more frequent contact than can be achieved.</p><p>In psychological theory, guilt is often seen as a negative emotion that motivates positive behavioral change. This theory can also be applied to the mother-child bond. For example, guilt that arises from not visiting enough may motivate children to visit more, hence, reducing guilt. But guilt may also be reduced when parents exercise moderation in their downward support, letting the stream of support turn more quickly in the expected upward direction, from children to parents. Guilt is not always productive. When guilt arises from negative emotions such as anger and irritation, both of which are measured in this study, it is less clear which productive changes a person could make. Guilt that stems from ambivalence may therefore be perceived as more awkward. Adult children may visit their parents more often or offer more support when they feel guilty, but changing the way they feel about their parents is a different matter. This would require a change of expectations and a change in norms. Such mental and cultural changes are more difficult to achieve.</p><p><em>Featured image by congerdesign via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/623518132/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/" rel="nofollow">How to prepare for death</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/the-life-and-legacy-of-florence-nightingale-timeline/" rel="nofollow">The life and legacy of Florence Nightingale [timeline]</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>What happens to people when they lose their religion? Do they start to think and act just like people who have never believed — or do they keep some psychological and behavioural traces of their past?</p>
<p>Given the number of people worldwide who report no current religious affiliation (more than 1 billion) and predictions that this will <a href="http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org">expand into the future</a>, it’s important to explore just how homogenous, or otherwise, this group is, argue the researchers behind a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17410-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences</em>.</p>
<p>Daryl R. Van Tongeren at Hope College, US, and his colleagues conclude from their studies that there is in fact a “religious residue” that clings to people who cease to identify as religious. “Formerly religious individuals differed from never religious and currently religious individuals in cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes,” the team reports.</p>
<p><span id="more-39578"></span>Why might such a residue exist? Because for people who are religious, the kinds of attitudes and behaviours that go along with religion are likely to be important to the way those individuals see themselves. Picture someone who grew up in a strongly Christian household, for example, with parents who promoted Christian morals, and who volunteered their time through the church. Even if that person later no longer identifies as Christian, these experiences may have enduring psychological impacts. Our social identities <em>can</em> change, the researchers note, but this usually only happens slowly.</p>
<p>For their first study, the team recruited just over 3,000 nationally representative online participants from the US, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. These people were asked about their religious identity, beliefs and practices, and the extent to which they were exposed to religious behaviours during childhood. Then they completed a (very brief) measure of their subjective prosociality (their perception of their helpfulness towards other people, for example), a scale that measured their social values, and also a test that assessed their attitudes towards God.</p>
<p>The team found that a sizeable proportion — 20.94% — of the participants reported being formerly religious. And, they argue, their data revealed evidence for a religious residue effect. On various measures, including religiosity, self-reported prosociality and prosocial orientation (such as wanting everyone in a group to do well, rather than aiming for individual success), currently religious participants scored the highest, followed by formerly religious and finally never religious people. This was true for each of the three nationalities sampled.</p>
<p>To explore this further, the team ran a second study on 1,626 men and women from the same countries. This time, there were equivalent numbers of never-religious, formerly religious and currently religious participants. And as well as repeating the steps in the first study, these people were given the option of donating a percentage of their participation payment to Save the Children, and also of volunteering to complete another short survey (they could offer anything between 5 and 15 minutes of their time).</p>
<p>Among those who agreed to volunteer for the extra survey, the currently religious gave up more time than both the other groups. Currently religious people also donated more of their money to charity than formerly religious people — but this group in turn donated more than the never religious. This shows that formerly religious people don’t just say they are more prosocial but act in a more prosocial way than never-religious types, the team says.</p>
<p>Well, this particular study seems to show that. But, remember, the participants in both these studies were all first asked about their religious identity. If, as the researchers argue, being prosocial is an important element of being religious, then currently religious, and even previously religious, participants had all just been primed to think of religion, and (whether consciously or not) everything that goes with that. Van Tongeren maintains that as the participants were asked a host of different questions, this is unlikely to be an issue. But I don’t think they can rule out the possibility that this inflated these groups’ prosociality scores.</p>
<p>For the final study, the team shifted to data from New Zealand collected between 2009 and 2017 as part of an annual, longitudinal national sample of registered voters. This revealed that volunteering was about twice as common among religious vs non-religious people. It also showed that the annual chance of a participant losing their religion but still spending time in voluntary or charitable work was much higher than the chance of someone losing their religion and stopping volunteering. This supports the religious residue hypothesis, the researchers argue.</p>
<p>But plenty of non-religious people also volunteered their time. Being the kind of person who volunteers could constitute an important aspect of anyone’s social identity, in and of itself, and so be resistant to change, whether you are religious or not. However, Van Tongeren maintains that the data provides evidence for the “lingering effects of prosociality, even after people stop identifying as religious”.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has been <a href="https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/">no exception</a>, and in fact, has highlighted how misinformation and disinformation can damage public health response efforts.  In particular, damage to trust, heightened confusion, and intensified discord can widen the gap between effective public health interventions and public willingness to support them.</p>
<p>Misinformation about disease outbreaks spreads rapidly in information voids, when there is little true information to ground viewers in the reality of the current situation. While we are learning more every day, there are many unknowns about COVID-19. As a result, the continued lack of definitive information on the virus and its spread has created an opportunity for misinformation and disinformation to take root.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent research published by our team takes a close look at misinformation during October 2014, when cases of Ebola were identified in the US. We sought to understand misinformation in the context of an emerging, fear-inducing disease in order to draw lessons for future outbreaks or epidemics that might similarly frighten the public. Little did we know that we would be publishing this research in the midst of one of the largest and most severe pandemics in recent history.  The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11863 alignleft" height="183" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/question-3385451_640-300x183.jpg" width="300" />First, we learned that misinformation can come in many forms, making it harder for people to determine what information is correct. While about 5% of the tweets we reviewed were false, another 5% were partially true or subtle misinterpretations of true information. While it may seem simple to label information as either true or false, we found making this distinction to be incredibly nuanced. In the process of hand coding thousands of tweets, even trained coders with public health expertise sometimes found that distinguishing between true and misleading information was challenging and required the combined judgement of several people.  Many people may not be able to take the time to carefully and objectively verify nuanced half-truths, instead making judgements based on their own knowledge, experiences, and worldview.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found a strong tie between misinformation and political content</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, we found a strong tie between misinformation and political content. We had initially, and perhaps naively, thought that misinformation during a health event like an Ebola outbreak would primarily be framed in a health context. Instead, we observed great overlap in misinformation, political tweets, and tweets that seemed designed to induce societal <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567">discord.</a> Additionally, both the 2014 Ebola outbreak and COVID-19 have occurred during contentious US election years, and there are indications that COVID-19 misinformation has been <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/03/18/knowledge-and-perception-surrounding-covid-19/">politicized.</a> An important lesson emerging from this is that public health events, response activities, and communication efforts, while often apolitical in their inception, can be vehicles for messages that serve goals beyond ensuring the health of the public.</p>
<p>Finally, we found a several different misinformation types or tropes. Government conspiracies, false rumors of concerning viral characteristics (eg airborne transmission of the Ebola virus), and fake cures were the most frequent types. Today, we see these same <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/what-can-coronavirus-tell-us-about-conspiracy-theories/610894/">rumor tropes</a> appearing during the COVID-19 epidemic. In our sample of Ebola-related tweets, some rumors were refuted, but many were not, casting some doubt on the ability of social media to self-correct effectively. More research must be done to determine the best ways to protect the public from these specific types of rumors and misinformation.</p>
<p>Developing solutions to reduce the spread of misinformation and disinformation from div<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11862" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/social-300x200.jpg" width="300" />erse sources, including public figures, will not be easy. Further research is needed to understand how best to reach populations resistant to traditional public health messaging and health authorities. While essential efforts must be taken by social media platforms to control the spread of misinformation, the suggestion that technology companies should simply act to stop the dissemination of often nuanced and subtle misinformation overlooks the role of many other important stakeholders – and our own need to take a hard look in the mirror and improve the ways that we, as members of both the public and scientific community, consume and provide information to others.</p>

<p>Much of the discourse surrounding mental health over the last few years has focused on stigma: breaking down those unhelpful myths around mental illness that both prevent people seeking help and, sometimes, lead to outright discrimination.</p>
<p>What part culture has to play in this mission is an interesting question. Both the “madman” and the asylum have been a ubiquitous presence in cinema, literature and television, often to the chagrin of those who have had such stereotypes directly affect their lives. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2764842?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=042420">new study</a>, published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>, has looked at the impact one recent film, <em>Joker</em>, might have had on prejudice.<span id="more-39570"></span></p>
<p>The film is a gritty retelling of the origin story of Batman’s nemesis, the Joker, inspired by classic 1970s cinema. Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is depicted as having unspecified mental health problems: after his medication supply is cut off, he goes on a violent rampage and becomes the antihero we know from the comics.</p>
<p>Whether or not the film was stigmatising was subject to great debate at time of release: in <em>T</em><em>he Guardian</em> a pair of doctors  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/21/joker-mental-illness-joaquin-phoenix-dangerous-misinformed">argued that the film perpetuated damaging stereotypes</a>, for instance, whilst another piece in the same paper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/27/joker-makes-great-disability-art-by-letting-its-hero-bite-back">described it as an authentic depiction</a> of someone misunderstood by an uncaring society.</p>
<p>To investigate whether watching the film influenced people’s attitudes towards those with mental illness, Damian Scarf from the University of Otago and colleagues held screenings of <em>Joker</em> for 84 participants and of <em>Terminator: Dark Fate, </em>a film with no depiction of mental illness, for 80 participants. Demographic data was taken for all participants, including whether or not they had personal experience of mental health problems.</p>
<p>Before and after both screenings, participants completed the Prejudice Toward People With Mental Illness (PPMI) scale, which gauges how much the respondent fears or avoids people with mental health problems, and how much they view them as unpredictable or malevolent .</p>
<p>Results suggested that watching the film did increase negative perceptions of mental illness. Participants watching <em>Joker</em> had a mean score of 2.99 before watching: this increased to 3.20 after having seen it. Those watching <em>Terminator: Dark Fate, </em>on the other hand, had a mean score of 2.91 before and 2.88 after watching the film. Unsurprisingly, those with a history of mental illness had lower PPMI scores across the board.</p>
<p>There were a few limitations to the research. Sample size was extremely small, to start: future research could look at a larger sample, and at a wider range of media. The study was also unable to probe how often prejudicial attitudes lead to tangibly discriminatory behaviour towards people with mental health problems: though discriminatory behaviours are included in the PPMI scale, self-reporting such behaviours may not be a fully accurate way of linking perceptions and related actions.</p>
<p>No matter what you think of <em>Joker</em> itself, it’s hard to deny that cinema hasn’t always been kind to mentally ill people, whether that’s in schlocky asylum-based horror films or in less antagonistic but intensely pitying alternatives. As society tries to leave stigma behind, however, it may be time for the stereotypes to be retired completely in favour of the richly drawn and complex narratives that are truly deserved.</p>

<p>A study by <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01822-9">Ma <em>et al.,</em></a> published this week in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a>, sought to examine the predicative role of the AACS for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and mortality in PD patients.  This study was a single-center, prospective, cohort study utilizing lateral lumbar radiography to determine the AACS for 292 PD patients.  The patient population had a median PD duration of 28.4 months.  One-fourth of patients had a history diabetes and one-third had a history of cardiovascular disease.  The average AACS was 2.0.  The patients enrolled were categorized into tertiles of low (meaning AACS = 0), medium (meaning AACS = 1-4) and high (meaning AACS &gt; 4). The duration of follow-up averaged 43.6 months and there were 65 MACCE and 84 deaths.  It was noted that the AACS was associated with age, PD duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.  Ma <em>et al.</em> observed that there was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MACCE and all-cause mortality in the upper AACS tertile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?  I might strongly consider starting.  An x-ray is a low cost, noninvasive test that could potentially help with risk stratification.  Those patients with a high AACS should have immediate referrals to cardiology for cardiovascular disease prevention and evaluation.  The frequency of testing and the initiation of testing would need to be clarified. Additionally, there is a potential use in kidney transplantation evaluations.  Many transplant centers utilize a non-contrast CT as part of the transplant work-up addressing the site of anastomosis.  Findings often prompt further cardiovascular disease testing.  These CT results could help triage those who needed more extensive testing.  Those with a high AACS might need to go directly to cardiac catheterization for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Whereas those with a low AACS might go directly to a stress test or coronary CT.  This stratification could eliminate unnecessary testing, prevent complications, and save money.</p>
<p>The more passive approach would be using the information when abdominal aortic calcification is incidentally found.  Then patients could proceed to a cardiology referral or further testing.  However, in this population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, I would tend to take a more active role in prevention.</p>

About <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html">30 percent</a> of older adults in the U.S. live on incomes that are near the poverty threshold and about <a href="https://paa2012.princeton.edu/papers/121818">one third</a> of older adults in the U.S. report financial strain, meaning they have difficulty making ends meet. Importantly, financial challenges are modifiable social determinants of health that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Older adults facing financial challenges may find it difficult to meet basic needs. They may run out of food or medications near the end of the month when funds run low. They may not be able to afford housing that is properly heated or that meets their needs to safely age in place in their own homes. In addition to lacking basic necessities, individuals face greater day-to-day stress managing household finances. There is good evidence that older adults facing financial challenges are more likely to become disabled and die earlier than their wealthier peers.</p>

We compared four different measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial strain, education, and professional occupation) to see which of these predicted new cases of dementia.</p>
<p>In our study, older adults who experienced either low income or financial strain were more likely to develop dementia than those who didn’t. Education, which has already been linked to dementia in other studies, predicted dementia in our study as well. In fact, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31363-6/fulltext"><em>The Lancet</em> Commission on Dementia</a> identifies low education as a key dementia risk factor. However, when we compared education to income and financial strain we found similar results for all three socioeconomic measures. This suggests that low income and financial strain may be just as important as low education with regard to risk of dementia.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11868 aligncenter" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/figure-300x124.png" width="510" />
<p>These results are important because financial challenges may actually be more modifiable for older adults than education. Most adults complete their educational training early in life, but financial challenges could be addressed at any point in the life course.</p>
<p>Many programs and policies are already in place that are intended to support older adults facing financial challenges. Public benefits, entitlement programs, and tax credits may alleviate financial challenges. However, these programs are often under-utilized. For example, the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides money to buy food but only about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/charts/snap-participation-rates/">40 percent</a> of eligible older adults use the program.</p>
<p>Results from this study complement results of <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1340-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">another study</a> our team published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a> last year, which highlighted the importance of housing quality for financially strained older adults. In that study, we used the same national sample of U.S. older adults to track changes over time in both financial strain and markers of home disorder such as tripping hazards, pests, or broken furniture and flooring. We also tracked mobility over the same time period.</p>
<blockquote><p>Efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults.</p></blockquote>
<p>In that study, financial strain and home disorder interacted with each other over time – financial strain predicted more home disorder and home disorder predicted greater financial strain. Importantly, both financial strain and home disorder predicted mobility limitations among older adults, suggesting that both play a role in functional decline. These results suggest that older adults with financial strain may slip into a downward spiral of worsening home conditions and worsening financial strain that leads eventually towards disability.</p>
<p>These results highlight the importance of early intervention to alleviate financial strain in order to prevent disability for healthy older adults. Also, these results suggest that interventions should include improving home conditions for financially strained older adults, which may break the link between financial strain and disability.</p>
<p>Together, these two studies add to a growing body of evidence linking financial challenges, including low income and financial strain, with poor health outcomes for older adults. As populations age around the world, we should pay greater attention to supporting older adults facing modifiable financial challenges. Our research suggests that efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults. Existing resources for food, housing, and health care supports should be strengthened to meet the growing needs of populations aging with financial challenges.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/alcohol-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Whether we are meeting friends in a bar, eating out, or planning a night in at home, one of our first thoughts is often: ‘What shall I drink?’. The choice in bars, restaurants and supermarkets is often overwhelming, with long menus, details of tasting notes, and special offers to review. The one consistent feature is that alcohol is everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018#data-sets">In England</a>, the majority of adults drink alcohol, and around half do so every week. While the risk of harm remains low for many people, 1 in 3 men and 1 in 7 women drink above the current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-consumption-advice-on-low-risk-drinking">UK low-risk drinking guidelines</a> (14 units/week). This <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/">increases the risk</a> of developing alcohol-related illnesses, including mouth, throat and breast cancers, stroke and heart disease.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11865 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/drinks-2578446_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Making alcohol less affordable is one way to reduce consumption <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616324205">effectively</a>. However, we are interested in other potential approaches. Specifically, we were interested in whether changing the drinking <em>environment</em> could influence drinking behavior.<a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3/abstract"> Previous research</a> has shown that people are more likely to buy and eat healthier food if a proportion of less healthy meal or snack options are replaced with healthier options. Our study investigated whether altering the availability of non-alcoholic compared to alcoholic drink options would similarly impact people’s choices.</p>
<p>We asked 808 adult weekly beer drinkers to take part in an online study. They were asked to choose 1 drink, that they would like to have today, from a display of both non-alcoholic (soft drinks and alcohol-free beer) and alcoholic (beer) options. They were shown 1 of 4 possible drink displays that either had the same proportion of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks (2 of each, or 4 of each), or a higher or lower proportion of non-alcoholic drinks (6 non-alcoholic and 2 alcoholic, or 2 non-alcoholic and 6 alcoholic).</p>
<p>In real-world environments – such as a supermarket or busy bar – people often have to make quick choices about which drink they choose. Therefore, we also asked half of the drinkers to make their choice under a high time pressure.</p>
<blockquote><p>The odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that the odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased, and 48% higher when the proportion of non-alcoholic options was increased. There was no evidence that increasing the number of non-alcoholic drinks increased their selection when the proportion of drink types remained the same. There was no evidence that giving drinkers a time limit affected the type of drink they chose.</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, this is the first evidence to suggest that interventions to increase the availability of non-alcoholic drinks – particularly their proportion relative to alcoholic drinks – could support a reduction in alcohol selection.</p>
<p>Although many bars and restaurants offer at least one type of alcohol-free beer, this is often kept in the fridge behind the bar, or at the back of a menu, and the range of non-alcoholic drinks is often <a href="http://nudgingpubs.uk/pubs-and-bars-are-constrained">limited</a>. These alcohol alternatives lack visibility and it requires greater effort for customers to choose them. However, the market for these drinks is <a href="https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2019/05/20/How-much-has-the-no-alcohol-category-grown">growing</a>, which is providing greater choice, and over time, increasing exposure to non-alcoholic drinks could help shift social norms around drinking these products.</p>
<p>Interventions to increase the proportion of non-alcoholic drinks available are timely and of interest not only to policy makers, but also license holders and drinks manufacturers. Research in real-world settings is needed now to understand the potential impact on alcohol consumption.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/_TmJ9Pc-sTE/">What are your priorities for data sharing?</a></h4>

<p><em>This blog was written by <span lang="EN-US">Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, </span><span lang="EN-US">Publisher, Open Research, PLOS.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been working to identify important problems faced by researchers in the practice of open research. And, to deepen understanding of researchers’ priorities with regards to sharing research data, we’ve launched a new study. If you are a researcher residing in the US or Europe who has shared or reused research data please </span><a href="http://sgiz.mobi/s3/PLOS-Research-Data-Survey?S=B"><b>take a few minutes to take part in the survey</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the survey will also help determine if and how well researchers’ needs are met by existing tools and services for sharing research data, and inform future PLOS initiatives and partnerships – beyond the publication of open access journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers’ experiences and attitudes about sharing research data are arguably already well studied. The annual </span><a href="https://www.digital-science.com/resources/portfolio-reports/the-state-of-open-data-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of Open Data reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Digital Science, and </span><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9056-8251"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Tenopir’s research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are valuable, recurring examples. And a bibliography of studies we’ve read, or re-read, recently is included below </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1–24]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why do we need another survey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the results of numerous studies, researchers’ concerns about misuse and scooping are amongst the most common concerns about, or barriers to, data sharing. These concerns are followed, in their frequency, by the more practical concerns about copyright and licensing (ownership) and the time and effort required to make research (data) openly available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In principle there are numerous solutions available for some of the problems, barriers and concerns represented by these findings – from repositories, institutional research support, training programmes, to journal policies and procedures. Yet in practice — to give one example of assumed good practice in open research — today only </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about a fifth of researchers use repositories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to share data supporting published papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having reviewed this prior research and having spoken with different groups of researchers ourselves in the last few months, we’ve concluded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is considerable evidence for various cultural and practical concerns with sharing of research data, and growing evidence of how sharing and reusing data can benefit research, the economy and researchers’ careers. But, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are less certain about how </span><b>important </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">each of these problems are, and if and </span><b>how well existing tools, products, and services help solve these problems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data sharing, research data, and open data are very important at PLOS — reflected in our long-standing policies on data sharing. But there is more that we can do to enable research data sharing and reuse, which may help realise more of its benefits. We expect that this study will help identify researchers’ priorities, which in turn will guide our priorities for new initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re very grateful for any time researchers can lend to completing the survey and, naturally, we plan to share data from the survey publicly in the future.</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>Photo: A child looks at a Darth Vader mask at an exhibition in the Louvre, Paris, in 2015. Credit: Chesnot/Getty Images</em></p>
<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Watching <em>Return of the Jedi</em> with my kids the other night, I found myself quite liking Darth Vader. After all, he’s<em> s</em>elf-disciplined, determined, conscientious, and uncompromising — while also being (almost) entirely evil…</p>
<p>It’s no secret that we can <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/02/can-evolutionary-psychology-explain-why-we-love-to-hate-evil-villains/">find fictional villains fascinating</a>. It’s been argued that that’s because we are evolutionarily drawn to understanding bad guys, as well, of course, to seeing the good guys prevail. But <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620909742">new research</a>, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests that this is not the full story.</p>
<p><span id="more-39564"></span>In real life, we do tend to like people who are similar to us in positive ways — who are also conscientious, say, or agreeable. But research has found that we recoil from others who are similar to us in positive ways but possess antisocial traits, too — they’re intelligent but deeply manipulative, for instance. This is thought to be because it’s uncomfortable for us to see any similarities between ourselves and “bad” people.</p>
<p>Rebecca Krause and Derek Rucker at Northwestern University wondered if the same was true when it came to <em>fictional</em> characters, who may not pose the same potential threat to our self-image.</p>
<p>To explore this, the pair first analysed data from a company called CharacTour, an entertainment website with more than 230,000 registered users at the time of the study. CharacTour staff had identified thousands of characters as villains (such as Maleficent and the Joker) and as heroes (such as Sherlock Holmes and Yoda) and sidekicks. They had also used scales to rate these characters on mini-spectrums for various traits — from chatty to reserved and highbrow to lowbrow, for example. Users could also rate themselves on these traits, using the same scale, and become “fans” of characters they were most drawn to.</p>
<p>Krause and Rucker found that characters with a higher score on any given trait tended to have a greater percentage of fans with that trait. Strikingly, the similarity effect was even stronger for villains than non-villains. The normal aversion that we feel towards similar, but bad, individuals had vanished.</p>
<p>The pair also found that villains and their fans didn’t share only positive traits. Compared with non-villains, villainous characters had a greater percentage of fans who rated themselves as dishonest, rude, manipulative and selfish. Fiction seemed, then, to free people to be drawn to the darker sides of our characters. (A finding that made me wonder which dark traits, exactly, I might share with Lord Vader…)</p>
<p>The pair then sought to firm up their findings, and dig into potential explanations, using a series of online studies.</p>
<p>The first, which involved 100 student participants, confirmed that it was more discomforting to be compared to a real-life villain than to a fictional one. Further work meanwhile supported the idea that fiction typically frees us from the threat of negative social comparisons — but not in all contexts. When a group of participants was told that they were “weirdly” similar to a “super-creepy” fictional villain in a new film, they reported being perfectly happy to watch the film while alone. But as an option for a first date, it became distinctly unappealing. First dates of course involve potentially important social judgements. The risk of being likened in any way to a “super-creepy” villain clearly represented a threat to those participants’ self-image.</p>
<p>But a first date is a special case. “Our research suggests that stories and fictional worlds can offer a ‘safe haven’ for comparison to a villainous character that reminds us of ourselves,” comments Krause. This can open us up to learning more about darker parts of the self that we don’t normally explore, the pair thinks.</p>
<p>Stories might not be the only way to mitigate threats to self-perceptions, they add. Having a secure attachment figure — someone who we know loves us — might also act to protect us from the discomfort caused by feeling at least partly similar to a morally undesirable person, perhaps.  “Although stories were used in the present approach, our findings invite a more general exploration of other factors that might mitigate threat and thus attract people toward comparison with similar but negative others,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>But, as they warn in their paper, there could be dangers here. If, for example, a person were to see a reality-TV star, say, as a “fiction-esque” and appealing villain, “this could have potentially sinister implications for people’s choice of role models.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/04/aspiring-to-be-rich-may-damage-your-relationships/">Aspiring To Be Rich May Damage Your Relationships</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Daydreaming about an ideal life, it can be easy to slip into fantasies about wealth <em>—</em> there’s a reason, after all, that “winning the lottery” is the ultimate dream for so many people. The <em>reality</em> of being rich, however, often doesn’t match that dream, with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/04/people-who-prioritise-time-over-money-are-happier/">some research</a> suggesting that people who prioritise time are much happier than those who prioritise money.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220910872">new study in the <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a> drives home the message that money really isn’t everything. The team finds that “financially contingent self-worth” <em>—</em> self-esteem based on financial success <em>—</em> can leave people feeling lonely and disconnected.</p>
<p><span id="more-39559"></span>Deborah Ward of the University at Buffalo and colleagues first asked 345 participants to rate themselves on various statements  related to financially contingent self-worth, such as “my self esteem is influenced by how much money I make” and “I feel bad about myself when I feel I don’t make enough money”. Next, participants reported how much they felt time pressures in their life, rating statements including “there are not enough minutes in the day” on a scale of one to seven.</p>
<p>Participants then estimated what percentage of time they spent being alone and with others (either working or socialising), and stated how often they felt lonely and isolated and how connected they felt to other people. The team also measured participants’ sense of autonomy <em>—</em> how much control and choice they felt they had in life.</p>
<p>As expected, participants whose self-worth was tied to their financial success reported feeling more time pressure <em>—</em> which, in turn, was related to greater feelings of social disconnection and loneliness. Participants’ sense of autonomy also partly accounted for this relationship: those whose self-worth was more financially contingent reported a lower sense of autonomy, which was related to worse social outcomes.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the same factors on a larger scale, with 940 participants completing the survey. Again, results suggested that financially contingent self-worth was associated with both lower autonomy and worse social outcomes; lower autonomy was also associated with spending less time with family and friends.</p>
<p>In a final study, 246 participants completed daily diary measures at home examining the same concepts as before; this time, however, participants reported how they’d felt or behaved <em>that day</em> rather than in general.</p>
<p>On days when participants reported particularly high financially contingent self-worth, both autonomy and social outcomes were far worse. Those who regularly reported high financially contingent self-worth were also more likely to report lower autonomy and worse social outcomes in general. These people also reported feeling more concerned about their finances.</p>
<p>We already knew that basing self-worth on financial achievements can have pretty negative consequences <em>—</em> financially contingent self-worth can lead to higher anxiety, increased feelings of pressure, and a higher likelihood of unfavourably comparing oneself to others.</p>
<p>The new study suggests that there are also social repercussions: if we believe money is the ultimate meaning of success, it makes sense that we’ll spend more time focusing on work than we will our relationships, that we’ll have less free time and that we’ll therefore feel less in control of our lives than we might want.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the data is correlational <em>—</em> the direction of cause and effect may not be as straightforward as this. But either way, if your self-esteem is financially contingent, working towards <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/29/people-who-try-to-be-environmentally-friendly-by-buying-less-stuff-are-happier-study-claims/">less materialistic</a> forms of validation may be a worthwhile long-term goal.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/dMBlQCMXynw/">A Selfish Reason To Share Research Data</a></h4>

<p><em>This blog was written by</em> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giovanni Colavizza, Isla Staden, Kirstie Whitaker and Barbara McGillivray of the Alan Turing Institute and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS and first appeared on their <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/selfish-reason-share-research-data">website</a>.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of us adapt to the benefits of remaining connected with our peers and colleagues digitally, new evidence suggests that scholarly papers might get increased citations by staying digitally connected to the research data that support their results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote open, reproducible research, many journals have </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1629/uksg.463"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started to encourage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or even mandate that researchers share their research data and provide statements about the availability of their data in their published papers. These Data Availability Statements (DAS’s) in published papers (see Table for examples) provide a way to study if and how researchers share their data, and if data sharing correlates with citations of research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous studies have explored researchers’ data-sharing practices and their associations with citation counts in specific journals, or in specific research disciplines only. We analysed more than half a million papers across multiple journals and research disciplines, to explore the following questions: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are authors taking up the challenge of data sharing? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this beneficial for them as well as for the scientific community? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We analysed published articles from the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PubMed Open Access collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help answer these questions, and made all our </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3470062"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code and data available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for replication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an automated approach designed for the study, we classified different kinds of data availability statements, according to their main categories (illustrated in Table 1). The outcome is important as statements that contain a link to research data available in a public repository (category 3) are considered to be preferable over all other types of statements. However, depositing data in a repository may be more time-consuming for researchers than other approaches.</span></p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found that data availability statements are now very common in published papers. We also found that journal mandates to include these statements are effective, with big increases in the number of statements in 2014 and 2015, when </span><a href="https://plos.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Public Library of Science) and </span><a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BioMed Central), respectively, mandated them. When journals only encourage that authors provide a statement, only a small percentage of papers include them. In 2018 93.7% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Yet, </span><b>data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository are just a fraction of the total</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8% of PLOS publications and 12.2% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. Figure 1 gives an overview of data availability trends over time in PLOS journals, while Figure 2 exemplifies distinct approaches to data sharing from two BMC journals.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 1: Data availability statements over time in PLOS. The histogram shows the number of publications from specific subsets of the dataset and DAS categories: No DAS (0), Category 1 (data available on request), Category 2 (data contained within the article and supplementary materials), and Category 3 (a link to archived data in a public repository).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also find that </span><b>papers that link to data in a repository can have up to 25.36% (± 1.07%) higher citation impact on average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using a citation prediction model. While our results show that higher citations to a paper are correlated with linking to data in a repository, we cannot be certain this is the cause for the higher citations. However, this result may be encouraging for researchers, journals, publishers, funders and policymakers who are interested in data sharing and reproducible research. It suggests there might be a further incentive—beyond increasing transparency and reproducibility of results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to authors to make their data available using a repository.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be a variety of reasons for this effect. More efforts and resources are put into papers sharing data, thus this choice might be made for better quality articles. It is also possible that more successful or visible research groups have also more resources at their disposal for sharing data. Sharing data likely also gives more credibility to an article’s results, as it supports reproducibility. Finally, data sharing encourages re-use, which might further contribute to citation counts.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers are </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9980783.v2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there are insufficient resources and incentives to share their research data, and that more effort is required to publish data when publishing papers. However, this extra effort is really an investment rather than a cost. It is an investment in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.295"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more reliable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reusable research for the scientific community, and this new evidence suggests it could also be a reasonable, “selfish” investment in researchers’ own reputations. </span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology/">A pandemic of boredom</a></h4>

<p>It was just the two of them: on a raft, lost, floating off the coast of Africa—the lone survivors of a shipwreck. Years before, struck with stupendous boredom, Hymie Basteshaw decided to become boredom’s master. He read what others wrote about boredom, studied its physiology, and discovered its secrets in the wavering folds of human cells. Mid-sea, he now shares with Augie March his first and “obvious” findings. Boredom is “the shriek of unused capacities, the doom of serving no great end or design, of contributing to no master force. The obedience that is not willingly given because nobody knows how to request it. The harmony that is not accomplished.” Basteshaw is but a minor character—a psycho-biologist, a carpenter, a genius, a “maniac”—in Saul Bellow’s long picaresque novel, <em>The Adventures of Augie March.</em> He offers not a minor or obvious feature of boredom, but a discerning appraisal of its intimate nature. Boredom, Basteshaw tells March, although not in these exact words, is hybrid, both personal and social.</p><p>Our current situation is one of crisis, of resources, values, and priorities. It’s also a crisis for the study of boredom. It’s a call to understand boredom both as a psychological and social phenomenon. If our aim is to capture what it means to experience boredom right now—the boredom of social distancing, quarantine, and the pandemic—we can’t rely exclusively on lessons that we’ve drawn from willing participants in on-line or in-person studies. Yes, we are bored with more or less the same things that previously bored us. But we are bored because of our newfound and newly imposed social condition. In social distancing, we find ourselves in an unusual position. Both restrained and acutely aware of the meaninglessness of our everyday actions we are under the threat of a new boredom—a boredom that looks and feels just like our ordinary boredom, but which has grown out of a much different and more fertile ground.</p><p>What is boredom most fundamentally? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-017-9515-1">Boredom</a> is an unpleasant state that signals to us the presence of an unsatisfactory situation and which, at the same time, contains a strong desire to do something else. During boredom, we feel both <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02497.x?casa_token=_BCyupis9P0AAAAA:H6yd-UBkp3cjgUwfzp3lxDYk8FMAuT0r0vSbJQmW9VoQewZqlo17-H-V5tZGMHatenq63d23ysmtQw">frustrated and listless</a>. We’re disengaged from and dissatisfied with what we do. Our situation doesn’t hold our <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612456044?casa_token=StKmthlMIE4AAAAA%3ATtU3bwoycH54kqiCpwnOM2q2cGhirea80YUGx5oJcjvhJxw24NxB3PQsb5vUTwU91716zdieELpW">attention</a>. It doesn’t interest us and doesn’t strike us as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">meaningful</a>. In a state of boredom, we’re moved to think of alternative situations and goals, ones that are more interesting, engaging, and meaningful to us than our current ones. We itch to leave boredom behind and are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/books/edition/Propelled/MG0lzQEACAAJ?hl=en">propelled to try to do just that</a>.</p><p>Boredom is a problem—a disruption of agency, a deficit of meaning, or a block in our ability to engage cognitively and satisfactorily with our situation at hand. And yet, it’s also a solution. Or better, it’s the promise of a solution. The unpleasantness of boredom, along with its effects on our psychological processes and behavior, offers us a possible way out. Boredom is that disagreeable reminder that we should be doing something other than what we are currently doing. It’s also a repellent force, a drive that could, under the right conditions, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2017.1346240">allow us to overcome our discontent</a>.</p><p>What I have just described sounds a lot like a psychological state that exists in a social vacuum, but that isn’t so. Boredom can arise out of a perceived dissatisfaction with our situation, a mismatch between our wishes and reality, or even a lack of sufficient engagement with the task at hand. All of these prompts of boredom can be both personal and social. Any social condition that either begets or supports them would be one that promotes boredom.</p><p>We are currently experiencing a change in social order. Compared to our recent past, the present of the pandemic is one characterized by excessive order. Out of necessity, caution, concern, or fear, we are constrained. There’re real and tangible limits to our opportunities and obstacles to free action. And so, out of this new social order, boredom grows. “Boredom arises when we must not do what we want to do, or must do what we do not want to do,” psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-00161-018">once observed</a>. In <em>Melancholy and Society</em>, German sociologist Wolf Lepenies warned us of how socially frustrated agency is a fertile ground for boredom. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2010-15712-001">Experimental studies</a> agree that conditions over which individuals have little control can give rise to boredom. And <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820v2">a recent study</a> examining the attitudes of people living in quarantine in Italy appears to confirm it.</p><p>There’s another element of our social condition that contributes to the rise of boredom. Boredom is related not just to the perceived control or autonomy that we have over a situation but also to how meaningful our situation strikes us. Studies report that perceived meaninglessness is both a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">component</a> of and a likely <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2009.28.3.307">antecedent</a> to boredom. While social distancing, we often feel that our actions and activities are lacking in meaning. Why? In the face of the pandemic, our everyday activities seem insignificant. For those of us who are not nurses, doctors, first respondents, essential workers, or actively involved in helping others or fighting the spread of the virus, our actions seem to have little effect on the situation.</p><p>When faced with the boredom of the pandemic it helps to bring to mind the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01245/full">function</a> of boredom. It offers us a productive way to think about our boredom, for it underlines its existential import. We are fortunate not for this or that experience of boredom, but for the capacity to experience boredom. Boredom—in its non-chronic form—is a valuable tool and perhaps now, more than ever, a privilege. It’s both an affective reminder that we are stuck with ourselves and a call to become more than what we are right now.</p><p>But boredom can only do so much. Once it has made itself known to us, we are on our own. We have to decide how to act and what to do. We can turn to diversions or reflection, act rashly or prudently, give up or stand up, help others or look after ourselves. The possible outcomes of boredom are many and varied.New habits, opportunities, and careers often start with the thought “I am bored.” But so can unhealthy eating habits, binge drinking, drug use, or even <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/09/boredoms-push/">destruction</a>.</p><p>One hopes that in times like these boredom’s call can be put into productive and compassionate use. To borrow Voltaire’s words, one hopes that we can cultivate our garden: the ground out of which our personal and social existence can grow and flourish—not as an act of quietism but as a sign of resilience and as way to realize change.</p><p>It’s worth a try, even if it is done out of boredom.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@rhett_noonan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rhett Noonan</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dark-bedroom?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/">A pandemic of boredom</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622979590/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/quantitative-thinking-during-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Quantitative thinking during a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-children-going-viral-is-shaping-our-world/" rel="nofollow">How children going viral is shaping our world</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>One of our most popular posts here at <em>Research Digest </em>looked at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/">whether we all hear an inner voice while reading</a> (spoiler: most of us do <em>—</em> but 10% or so seem not to). Now researchers have found that readers aren’t the only ones to hear voices: authors themselves do as well. </strong>Almost two-thirds of authors surveyed at the Edinburgh book festival reported hearing their characters speaking while they were writing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/majority-of-authors-hear-their-characters-speak-finds-study">reports Alison Flood</a> at <em>The Guardian.</em><span id="more-39552"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Researchers have traditionally thought of autistic people as having “social deficits” when it comes to expressing emotion <em>—</em> but this ignores the fact that communication is a two-way street, </strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/research-on-facial-expressions-challenges-the-way-we-think-about-autism-134053">write Connor Tom Keating and Jennifer Cook</a> in <em>The Conversation</em>. Instead, their research suggests that autistic and neurotypical people use different facial expressions, and it is this mismatch between the two groups that can lead to difficulties in conveying or understanding emotion. “This is really crucial as it takes the element of blame away from the autistic person and instead proposes that these difficulties are a product of autistic and neurotypical differences,” the pair writes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Autism research is also often conducted without any input from people who are actually autistic. </strong>That’s beginning to change, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/autistic-voices-should-be-heard-autistic-adults-join-research-teams-shift-focus-studies?rss=1">reports Emily Willingham at <em>Science</em></a>: teams are increasingly including autistic researchers and focusing on studies that can improve the lives of autistic people, rather than searching for a cause or “cure”.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>At <em>Discover Magazine</em>, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/do-peer-reviewers-prefer-significant-results">Neuroskeptic reports</a> on a study providing further evidence that reviewers are more likely to accept psychology publications that report positive results. </strong>Researchers gave 127 reviewers for a media psychology conference an abstract that either reported a significant or non-significant finding. Overall, the reviewers gave higher ratings to the version with the significant result, although the effect was only small.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>As the lockdown continues, many of us have been left with a strange sense of time, with days seeming to blend together. </strong>That could have a negative impact on our later memory of this period, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/lockdown-distorting-memories-daily-landmarks-brains-false-memories">writes Julia Shaw at <em>The Guardian</em></a> (we also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/28/were-not-good-at-spotting-when-someone-has-a-false-memory-of-committing-a-crime/">covered Shaw’s work on false memories</a> this week). Shaw suggests staging memorable “landmark” events at home: new experiences which require a bit of effort to create and may be particularly interesting or emotional.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Physical contact is an important part of the human experience <em>—</em> so lockdown can be particularly hard for those who live alone.</strong> And it turns out there’s a name for that craving for hugs, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skin-hunger-coronavirus-human-touch">writes Sirin Kale at <em>Wired</em></a>: “skin hunger”.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Some parents may be worried about children’s screen time increasing during the</strong> <strong>pandemic</strong>. But at <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/dont-despair-if-your-child-is-glued-to-a-screen-it-may-be-keeping-them-sane">Amy Orben argues</a> that instead of worrying about time spent on screens, parents should instead look at what activities kids are engaging in <em>—</em> many of which may be providing them with an alternative way of socialising. And after reading her story, why not check out our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">recent PsychCrunch podcast</a> with Orben.</p>

<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>
<p>Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is similar to learning new motor skills, for example learning to play tennis, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance. However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge to date.</p>
<p>The proposed project will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is being developed by the Biocomputation Research Group (biocomputation.herts.ac.uk) to optimise robotic rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm. This has led and is still leading to the development of a rapidly increasing number of computational models of cerebellar learning, and to the successful applications of these cerebellar models to controlling simulated and real robots. The PhD project will involve the development and application of personalised cerebellar models in order to optimise rehabilitation robots for individual subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Applicants</strong> should have excellent computational and numerical skills and a very good first degree in computer science, biology, maths, physics, neuroscience, or a related discipline. Successful candidates are eligible for a research studentship award from the University (GBP 15,285 per annum bursary plus payment of the student fees). Applicants from outside the UK or EU are eligible.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>In basic terms, online status indicators convey availability: whether someone is on or offline, or when they last logged into a particular app. But if you’ve ever anxiously awaited a response from a prospective partner or suspected your friend might be ignoring you, you’ll be painfully aware of just how much weight that indicator can actually hold.</p>
<p>Now a new study has found that many users are not only aware of all that online status indicators can convey, but also change their behaviour accordingly. The research is <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/04/13/how-online-status-indicators-shape-our-behavior/">due to be published</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the 2020 ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>.<span id="more-39547"></span></p>
<p>Previous research has already shown that such indicators can inadvertently reveal a lot about our lives: <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/privacy-implications-of-presence-sharing-in-mobile-messaging-appl">one 2014 study</a> found that online status on WhatsApp was enough to identify daily routines, unusual messaging patterns, or even who users were talking to.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, Camille Cobb and her team recruited 200 participants to answer questions about their experiences with online status indicators. First, participants were presented with a list of 38 apps and asked to select those they use at least once a week. They were then asked a series of questions to gauge their familiarity with the design of status indicators and knowledge of how to control their visibility in apps.</p>
<p>Finally, participants were asked questions about their own experiences adjusting their visibility online (“is there anyone who would notice if you were offline for longer than usual?” or “have you ever changed your behaviour because you didn’t want to appear online?”) and behaviour towards others (“have you ever been surprised to notice that someone was online?” or “have you ever opened an app specifically to check if someone was online?”).</p>
<p>Use of apps with online status indicators was hugely common: 99% of participants reported regular use of at least one app with the feature, with Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger the most widely used.</p>
<p>Many participants wanted to control their online status, and had changed behaviour in order to do so: 23% had changed settings, 37% had avoided opening an app or quickly signed out to avoid a specific person, and three participants deleted an app from their phone altogether so that they didn’t appear “online”. This behaviour was usually aimed at a specific person: 43% had changed settings to avoid a particular person — often a current or former partner — versus just 25% who were trying to avoid people in general. Many stated that online status indicators had led them to feel under surveillance, aware that friends, partners or family members would be watching to see if or when they had signed in.</p>
<p>Checking for others’ online status was also prevalent: over half of participants said they had signed into or opened an app just to check somebody else’s status, and 41% said they had been “surprised” to see someone online, which in turn led to inferences about real-world behaviour and well-being and feelings around being ignored.</p>
<p>Online status indicators can be useful: as participants noted, they can be handy for working out when somebody might be available to chat or play a game, or knowing whether it might be better to message someone or call them instead. But the frequency with which participants anxiously checked others’ online status or sought to hide their own suggests that platforms should be offering better ways to meet user needs. Settings could be more transparent, for a start, or users could select not to appear online altogether — an option which many apps don’t yet offer.</p>
<p>Running into someone you really don’t want to see or speak to is an unfortunate fact of life, both on and offline: eliminating that altogether is probably unlikely to happen. But ensuring that users are able to adequately manage their online status may be something apps or messaging platforms could improve upon. Until then, it’s likely that online statuses will be a source of both community and anxiety.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Children who are victims of bullying often suffer a sense of helplessness. They don’t know what to do during bullying episodes and they don’t really believe anything will change or anyone can intervene effectively. Children subjected to bullying say it makes them feel sick, afraid, and helpless. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety, anger and depression. We know that as adults former victims can undergo similar feelings in the right circumstances.</p><p>Due to my research in the area of childhood bullying, I am contacted by many people about their own bullying incidents as children. They describe how they coped at the time. Often, they comment on how they’ve managed their lives in the wake of bullying.   The great majority have survived and gone on to live productive lives. However, during this world-wide COVID-19 crisis, adults relate that their mental state is similar to how they felt as children. I have received messages describing the reactivation of childhood memories of being captive to someone while feeling powerless.  In the face of the uncertainty generated by the coronavirus, the same emotions are rekindled: fear, anxiety, anger, and a certain amount of depression. While most are doing what they can in terms of preparedness and health precautions, helplessness is once again a prevailing emotion. Substance abuse held at bay has reemerged as a problem.</p><p>By this point, perhaps the majority of people are aware of a sense of helplessness while trying to outwait and outwit COVID-19 by using every best effort. It is a helpless feeling to see the numbers of deaths and to witness the struggles in the healthcare system. While everyone may feel some amount of anxiety related to the virus, survivors of bullying experience a heightened degree of fear, anxiety, and depression based on triggered childhood feelings. Helplessness is a familiar but unwelcome manifestation impacting their daily mood. Sheltering-in-place is difficult emotionally in general. But for victims of childhood bullying it is reminiscent of and activates the loneliness that was an everyday burden.</p><p>Trauma is an aspect of this health crisis. The loss of family and friends, and the fear of their loss, is overwhelming. Trauma results when such overwhelming stress exceeds one’s ability to cope. There are three distinct types of trauma: acute, chronic, and complex. Acute trauma describes what people are living through now, meaning the trauma is the result of a single event- the corona virus. Trauma can become chronic depending on the duration of an event; in this case how long people are required to shelter-in-place with all the problems attendant to that (loss of income, lack of childcare, family violence, etc.). Chronic bullying is traumatizing for children and it leads to changes in the brains’ ability to think clearly. At the very least, bullied children worry and their worries influence their actions. They try to hide and they learn to avoid their bullies. They often become worried, anxious adults. For those who endured bullying victimization as children, the trauma is complex. Those adults deal with childhood trauma and its effects in an ongoing way. Now they are dealing with the very personal nature of the fear of the virus as well.</p><p>Children can do very little when they are helpless. They don’t have the tools, the wisdom, the resources, or the maturity needed to ameliorate adverse childhood conditions. Adults by virtue of greater years, greater resources, and greater mental capacity are able, much of the time, to deal with difficult circumstances. But COVID-19 extracts its toll despite wisdom, years, or great resources. The virus is an equalizer in this respect. It exerts power over its victims. It is relentless in pursuing a host to control. It searches for any weakness to exploit. COVID-19 acts exactly like a bully. For those who have already been a victim in childhood, this new terror is another bully forcing people to stay inside hiding from its power. In this way, victims of childhood bullying, even with their adult resources, are revisited by an age-old sense of helplessness unique to them.</p><p>For adults intimidated and threatened throughout childhood, helplessness is not new. It has come back again in the shape of something even more powerful and intimidating.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@foxfox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Natalia Y</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/depression?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622804842/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/" rel="nofollow">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/quantitative-thinking-during-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Quantitative thinking during a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/envisioning-a-post-crisis-world/" rel="nofollow">Envisioning a post-crisis world</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>This blog post was written Dylan Roskams-Edris, Open Science Alliance Officer, Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, The Neuro.

<p><strong>Open Science Easing the Transition from Lab to e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of COVID19, the world is scrambling to figure out how to continue the functions of normal life while confined to a much smaller world of couches and home offices. Work, family and friend relationships, exercise, entertainment, and all the other elements of normalcy have been upended. The effort to maintain productivity (and, to be frank, sanity) has initiated a mass digital migration; a movement from life to e-life.</p>
<p>If you are a researcher you are likely dealing with your own unique micro-version of the predicament: how to continue working when you and your lab are self-isolated? In other words, how to replicate as many of the normal functions of a lab as possible in a digital environment; a movement from lab to e-lab.</p>
<p>Lab meetings have <a href="https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/covid19-zoom-lab-meeting/">migrated to video-conferencing</a> with relatively little friction; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00786-y">conferences have gone virtual astoundingly quickly</a>; manuscripts are being drafted and figures created – perhaps a tad earlier than originally planned; grants and proposals are being written. These are, however, only a small portion of what researchers do, and leave a huge swath of scientific work untouched and in stasis.</p>
<p>Those most able to continue useful work are those who, for whatever reason, have access to as much of their work as possible from home. Pictures of researchers lugging multiple work computers home in order to continue data analysis were common in the early days of the crisis.</p>
<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42994" height="512" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-1.png" width="496" /></a></p>
<p>There is a subgroup of researchers, however, who can continue work without having to cram several computer towers into the trunk of a car: those who created an up-to-date digital, online representation of their research activities right up to the moment they had to be abandoned. These lucky few, who put in the time and effort to create a comprehensive e-lab prior to the crisis, are for the most part those who already commited to open science. This is, of course, no accident.</p>
<p><strong>Open Science and e-Labs</strong></p>
<p>Open science is, at its most practical base, the effort to (1) create an accurate and well organized digital representation of research activities and (2) share that representation with as few barriers as possible so others can effectively check, replicate, rework, reuse, and remix findings. Even the concentration within open science on sharing physical materials – like cell lines, biospecimens, and model organisms – is to enable replication and follow-on research when sharing the information about those materials does not to allow others to generate them themselves due to the unique nature of the material or an inability to make materials locally.</p>
<p>Researchers who have incorporated open, online sharing of research resources throughout their work – sharing experimental designs and protocols, lab notebooks, data, software, etc – have, in effect, created a digital representation of a significant portion of their activities that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>Not to oversell things, open sharing of research resources does not mean that researchers and labs can continue functioning without a hitch in their experimental stride. Much of the actual physical work has necessarily halted. It does mean, however, that many of the inputs to and outputs of their research are available in a digital form; accessible from a couch, desk, or apartment window-sill. While the emphasis from open science advocates in the past has been on ensuring that these digital representations exist so they can be shared, an added advantage has now jumped to the fore: the ability to share your e-lab with your quarantined-self.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Yourself</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-2.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42996" height="148" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-2.png" width="461" /></a></p>
<p>Labs that have, for example, stored experimental data immediately upon collection on open science platforms such as the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://www.synapse.org/">Synapse</a>, <a href="https://openneuro.org/">OpenNeuro</a>, and <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a> now have seamless access to the last bit collected before retreating into quarantine. Analyzing this data may be impossible if the requisite software only exists on a work computer, or you don’t have a license to use it at home; if, however, research software has been openly shared via a platform like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> then it can be accessed from a park bench (assuming a decent wifi signal).</p>
<p>If the collected data needs to be put into the context of how it was collected, perhaps to elicit input from other lab members about the best way to analyze it, there is no easier way than accessing the relevant protocols through <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or an <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/">Open Lab Notebook</a>. Need to know exactly what reagents or model organisms were used in an experiment? If one cannot go check the freezer, cage, or delivery invoice, then checking the relevant <a href="https://www.rrids.org/">Research Resource Identifier</a> (RRID) listed in your shared protocol or notebook is the next best (if not better) thing.</p>
<p>The list of unanticipated advantages continues. Perhaps you need to get input from a normally-down-the-hall colleague about how to improve your protocol for the future, or eliminate an artifact from some data, or iron out a persnickety bug in analysis software. In the lab you could invite them to pull up a chair as you took them through the issue. Now that is, obviously, impossible. If the protocol, data, or software were shared, however, you could email them the link (or, better yet, <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-">persistent identifier</a>), open a videochat window, and collaborate from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Your Research Community</strong></p>

<p>One of the most heartening things I have seen while scrolling through my twitter-feed-turned-emotional-roller-coaster is that self-isolated researchers are engaging with openly shared research resources.</p>
<p>This is of course the case with COVID19 research, where openly shared software, data, manuscripts, and protocols relevant to the virus are being shared, collected, curated and adapted with blinding speed; but it goes farther than that. Every day I see someone in the neuroscience research community tweet something along the lines of “thank goodness for X piece of openly shared software/data that I can learn about and use from home!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-4.png"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-42998 aligncenter" height="1081" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Tweet-4.png" width="1059" /></a></p>
<p>When people are cut off from their physical labs and don’t have an e-lab of their own, it is wonderful to see them being able to pick up the tools and resources shared by others. The lessons we are being forced to learn about the fluidity, dynamism, and capacity for collective creativity enabled by sharing research resources will serve us well in the future.</p>
<p>My sincere hope is that those working with these new found tools and resources take the open ethos to heart and openly <em>reshare</em> any modifications, derived data, and new insights with the research community. Doing so closes the loop, creating a community-based feedback mechanism that encourages further sharing in the future and, more importantly, uses the expertise of the world-wide research community to create ever better science.</p>
<p><strong>Benefiting the Public and Less Well-off Researchers with an Open e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>Some of the people involved in shaping (see: arguing about) what open science is quail at the idea that open science has anything to do with equity and equality. They say that it is merely about replicability and transparency and that is it, harumph. What I hope this situation brings to light – as you swear at your institutional VPN for once again dropping you, or find yourself unable to download important papers because of paywalls your institutional account would normally breeze through – is that you are receiving a taste of what it is like outside the gilded ivory tower.</p>
<p>Such restrictions on access and use are what interested members of the public, or those at research institutes that cannot afford staggering subscription prices, or those in labs not well funded enough to pay for the licenses to fancy analysis software, face every day. The act of openly sharing a paper, a piece of software, a dataset, an equipment design, or whatever else is not just about replicability. Doing so is an act that expands the borders of science, allowing the participation of the previously excluded. It is an act of inclusion not in some abstract post-modern sense, but in the very real sense of choosing where and why to put the fences.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Open e-Lab with the World</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the fact that open sharing is useful to the isolated-sharer and their research community, shared research resources have taken on an unprecedented importance in the COVID19 crisis. Stories abound of how <a href="https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/covid-19-how-unprecedented-data-sharing-has-led-faster-ever-outbreak-research.html">sharing genetic sequences</a> and <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">protein structures</a> have led to the discovery of novel treatment targets, diagnostic testing protocols, and the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/record-setting-speed-vaccine-makers-take-their-first-shots-new-coronavirus">initiation of clinical trials</a> on a timescale that, in the pre-COVID19 era, would be unbelievable. Moreover, the rapid release of results via preprints has allowed the creation of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">competitions to apply machine learning</a> to generate yet more insights. Though similar mass sharing has occurred during previous outbreaks (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/plea-open-science-zika">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966">Ebola</a>), the fact that COVID19’s impact has been global (and, not to put too fine a point on it, has impacted the global north) holds the hope that this time it will stick.</p>
<p>There is no reason that the same strategies cannot be applied to the ongoing crises in neurological disorders, antibiotic development, and the treatment of rare diseases, to name only a few. Indeed, the kind of massive online collaboration to solve issues around testing, creating ventilators and personal protective equipment, solving protein structures, and identifying novel treatment targets in the context of COVID19 is <em>exactly</em> what open science advocates have been dreaming of for years.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to e-Labs and Global Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Open science has laid the groundwork for the creation of e-labs and for them to be linked up to enable global collaboration. The COVID19 crisis has, on so many levels, highlighted the importance and promise sharable, digital representations of research activity hold for the future of research. More people than ever are glimpsing the potential that e-labs interlinked into a global digital research ecosystem represents.</p>
<p>This bright future does not, however, come free of complications. Just as open science reveals the potential of sharing, it also reveals difficulties of coordination and consensus. If research is going to be conducted collaboratively on a global scale we need to make sure that shared resources are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (e.g. <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples">FAIR</a>). Doing so can be made easier through technology and sharing platforms, but what it requires most are education, communities collaboratively setting norms around standards and sharing practices, and a commitment to embed open science practices throughout the research lifecycle. The necessary changes in behaviour will require social and cultural innovation on the part of research communities at least as important as any technical advance.</p>
<p>Another big coordination problem has to do with eliminating research redundancies. Individual researchers within the global community need to coordinate so as to pursue different but complementary efforts. Doing so requires researchers to move past the stage of sharing resources in the hopes that those in their community will find it to engagement with that community. In the old, closed model such coordination was handled (albeit inefficiently) through journals and conferences where community members would be apprised of the work being done by others. The same task now must be undertaken in the digital world. Those of us interested in advancing open science are busily documenting how this is being done for COVID19 research in the hope that we can, after this is over, present an iron-clad case for how research communities can be rebuilt with digitally-mediated coordination planted deep in their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Making an Open Future to Benefit Everyone</strong></p>
<p>I would ask you to deeply consider how you can begin adopting open, collaborative, community based approaches in the future of your research, once the world is rightside-up again. Doing so isn’t just about some abstract idea of openness; it has real benefits for you, your lab, your research community, and the world. COVID is, it is true, producing never before seen destruction of research efforts from which many projects may never recover. Within this destruction, however, lay clues to how research can be remade better, more collaborative, more coordinated and, of course, more open.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>One of the biggest political challenges of this era is getting powerful people to take the threat of climate change seriously. The most straightforward way to do that would be with bottom-up pressure: if the people who vote demand that their leaders take assertive action against climate change, then politicians will have no choice but to do so (at least if they want to get into office, or to stay there). The major challenge to this, in turn, has been the lingering influence of climate denialism: disbelief in the reality that humans are the cause of climate change, or in the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p>What can be done to combat climate denialism? Back in 2011, the researchers Jonathon P. Schuldt, Sara H. Konrath, and Norbert Schwarz published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776">an article in </a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776"><em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em></a> which suggested one possible partial remedy: framing the issue a bit differently. They found that 75.0% of Americans expressed belief in “climate change,” but only 67.7% in “global warming.” It was Republicans driving this effect: among this more politically conservative subset of Americans, the difference was 60.2% versus 44.0%.</p>
<p>Those findings suggested that environmental campaigns and policy initiatives might do better if they refer to “climate change” rather than “global warming”, write Alistair Raymond Bryce Soutter and René Mõttus in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376">new paper in the </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376"><em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em></a><em><u>.</u></em> But while some follow-up studies had been conducted on this issue, with fairly mixed results, no one had yet carried out a direct, pre-registered replication. So Soutter and Mõttus attempted to both replicate the original result and expand it to two other countries: the United Kingdom and Australia. (This gave them a total sample size of 5,717, about double that of the original study.)</p>
<p><span id="more-39542"></span>As in the first study, the researchers simply asked respondents about whether they believed in climate change in one of two conditions — one which referred to the climate “changing”, and one which referred to it “warming” (see full wording below). This time around, though, the researchers found no statistically significant difference between the two conditions (88.8% registered agreement that “climate change” was occurring, while 88.0% said “global warming” was.) That pattern repeated itself in the study’s three main subgroups: in neither the US, the UK, nor Australia did word choice matter. Interestingly, and contrary to the original experiment, word choice didn’t matter among political conservatives, either. One aspect of the 2011 finding — unfortunately — was replicated: in all countries, conservatives were less likely than liberals to believe in climate change.</p>
<p>Why the generally different results this time around? The researchers explain that there’s no way to know, but they speculate it could be some combination of causes: one is simply that the American sample was a bit different, politically, with more self-identified Democrats and Republicans and fewer Independents and Others than in the 2011 sample (though it’s hard to imagine that having much of an impact on what had been such a giant-sized effect on Republicans). Perhaps more importantly, the 2011 study drew on data collected in 2009, and “[s]ince then there have been major social, political, and indeed environmental changes.” The terms might simply mean different things to people today than they did back then.</p>
<p>There’s one arguably questionable aspect of the original study’s methodology — and, since it was a direct replication, the follow-up as well — that bears mentioning. Here’s the language presented to the two groups, with the differences bolded by me:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature <strong>may have been changing</strong> over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘climate change’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature may <strong>have been going up </strong>over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘global warming’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>It could be argued that this doesn’t capture exactly what researchers are interested in. What matters is whether and to what extent people agree that the planet is <em>warming</em>, and the first passage doesn’t mention that concept at all due to the fact that <em>two</em> word choices, not just one, are different. So a different rate of agreement with the two statements could just reflect the fact that they are saying two different things — the first is asking the respondent whether the planet’s climate is merely “changing” (up, down, up and then down over time, whatever), while the second specifically points out “warming”. A cleaner test would have mentioned the temperature going up in both conditions, only swapping out “global warming” versus “climate change.”</p>
<p>Setting that aside, this partially failed replication is compatible with belief held by many researchers: when issues become politicised, people cling more tightly to their opinions. It could be that word choice matters more for issues that don’t have much of a bearing on someone’s ideological or social allegiances. But once an idea becomes politicised, it feels threatening to have the ‘wrong’ view on it, which suggests subtle matters like word choice likely matter less. And climate change (or global warming, if you like) has certainly become more politicised since 2009, unfortunately.</p>
<p>All of which suggests that something as minor as word choice is rarely going to nudge people’s beliefs on as contentious an issue as this one.</p>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, April 29, at 9am Pacific</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Iowa State University Library and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue our support for Open Access publishing with PLOS under this new agreement,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communications and Collections at Iowa State University. “Preserving and growing the diversity of scholarly publishers has never been more important, and this agreement reaffirms our commitment to seeing that pure Open Access publishers like PLOS thrive.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Iowa State University Library will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. Iowa State researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS’ mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies.</p>
<p>“The agreement with Iowa State University Library is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreement with the University of California,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”</p>

Sounds absurd, doesn't it? But not really. Not any more. Here's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trumps-first-deepfake/610750/" target="_blank">David Frum</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">April 26, 2020, was an especially manic day in the presidency of  Donald Trump.  <b>...</b>  something was gnawing at him. Perhaps his  business troubles were weighing on him.  <b>...</b>  Or perhaps Trump was still seething at the widespread  ridicule of his press conference of April 23, when he suggested using  disinfectant “<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahcpr/status/1253474772702429189" target="_blank" title="you must watch this parody by Sarah Cooper">by injection</a>.” Or perhaps something else had shifted his  mood from its usual setting of <i>seething aggrievement</i> to <i>frothing fury</i>.<br /><br />Whatever  the cause, between early afternoon and near 9 o’clock eastern time,  Trump fired off a sequence of crazy-even-for-him tweets and retweets. He  demanded that reporters be stripped of the <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>“Noble prizes”</b></span> they had  supposedly been awarded for their reporting on Trump scandals,  apparently conflating them with the Pulitzers—and then pretended that  his misspelling of <i>Nobel</i> had been intentional.  <b>...</b>  He retweeted an increasingly wild and weird range of  supporters’ Twitter accounts.</blockquote><br />Trump shows no compassion for the suffering around him, no sympathy for the families devastated by the loss of their loved ones, and only hollow praise for the health care workers, the bus drivers, the home delivery drivers, the grocery store clerks, and the sanitation workers who put their lives on the line every day.<br /><br />Eternal optimists say “we're all in this together” while sitting at home on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/" target="_blank" title="oh boo hoo, 'Zoom Fatigue'">Zoom meetings</a>, placing endless orders on Amazon, and fretting about their sourdough starter. I'm only marginally better, but I realize I'm privileged. {I've tried to help financially <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> contributing to homeless organizations, a fund for unemployed hourly workers, bookstores, museums, etc.}<br /><br />And obviously I'm way more pessimistic. <br /><br />How does this rant honor my cat??<br /><br /><br /><b>Case History </b><br /><br />Max was diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma in August 2019 at the age of 16. He also had a murky ailment that made it difficult for him to eat (“his tongue is inflamed” or later, “he has a mass at the base of his tongue”), but the true cause was never confirmed. He was prescribed oral chemotherapy pills three times a week and an <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/steroid-treatment-long-term-effects-in-cats" target="_blank">oral steroid</a> (prednisolone syrup) twice daily. I declined the chemo pills, opting for quality of life for both of us. Max's oral steroid became unworkable after four doses.<br /><br />This was not fair, especially after my wife suffered through Stage 4 cancer for a year. <br /><br />Another vet started bimonthly / monthly injections of Depo-Medrol (<a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/methyl-prednisolone" target="_blank">methyl prednisolone</a>) to reduce the inflammation in his mouth, and as a partial treatment for his lymphoma. It worked wonders (for a while). He ran up and down stairs, played with his toys, and jumped over the red chair!<br /><br />He started getting worse in January. His weight was down to 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg), a 2 lb loss in two months. He was prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine" target="_blank">buprenorphine</a> as needed for pain and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/mirataz-mirtazapine-transdermal-ointment-veterinarians" target="_blank" title="Ha! mirtazapine is an antidepressant for humans that causes -- you guessed it -- weight gain">transdermal mirtazapine</a> as an appetite stimulant. My quest for palatable foods became more and more challenging. I spent hours walking the aisles of pet superstores.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="405" data-original-width="720" height="225" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><b>ADDENDUM (April 28, 2020):</b> How could I forget his stint on an all-chicken diet (KFC </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> no skin of course </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> or grocery store roasted chicken), which he enjoyed for a few weeks until he could no longer eat chicken... </span></span><br /><br />His last regular appointment was March 9. And then the shelter-in-place orders were issued.<br /><br /><br /><b>Pet Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic</b><br /><br />Max's condition was getting worse. Depo-Medrol was less and less effective, and he needed injections every two weeks. The veterinary practice enacted stringent measures to protect its essential workers. In-person appointments were reserved for animals showing signs of extreme pain and suffering. Virtual Vet was used for consults and for recommending treatment plans. We had an appointment on March 27. Max was prescribed his usual meds. I picked them up curbside (calling upon arrival) and paid via contactless transaction. I watched a helpful <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS815US815&amp;oq=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.8839j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> and then administered his subcutaneous injection of Depo-Medrol.<br /><br />By April 16, I had grown desperate. The poor fellow was having a severe bout of diarrhea that lasted for days. I tried scheduling a Virtual Vet appointment and called for a refill of buprenorphine. Finally I got through and picked up more meds the next day. These included oral <a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/metronidazole" target="_blank" title="chicken flavor!">metronidazole</a>, a hideously bitter and distressing medication that made his mouth foam.<br /><br />He improved slightly. I was up for hours in the middle of the night, trying to coax him to eat. Some "meaty morsels" and "flaked' varieties were palatable for their gravy. I got out the food processor and whirled them into a very soft format, which he mostly rejected. “But you were just licking the gravy off these meaty morsels!” I told him. Finally I came up with a winning concoction. But this was only a palliative interlude before the inevitable.<br /><br />Then I realized I'd established a Palliative Care Unit for my cat.<br /><br />On April 23, I could no longer care for him myself. I brought him to the ER for severe dehydration. He had blood work and an "incidental" ultrasound, neither of which he'd had since his initial diagnosis. The results were devastating. Anemia due to suspected blood loss from his GI tract. Elevated white blood cell count (no surprise). Emerging diabetes mellitus (e.g., glucose in his urine), a known side-effect of steroid treatment. He weighed only 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs).<br /><br />Most concerning was “free fluid in the abdomen and what looks like masses, possibly lymph nodes and fluid distended bowel loops.”  /  “If he does not improve in the next few days to a week, humane euthanasia should be considered given what we know.”<br /><br />I picked him up and brought him home. He hated car rides much more than actual visits to the vet or treatments of any sort. Veterinary staff all loved him. The report from his ER doc even said, “Max is a very good cat.” <br /><br />He was withdrawn for several hours. Then he got over it and sat on my lap in the red chair, purring. Here he is, as beautiful as ever.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="414" data-original-width="720" height="230" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The change in Max from that day to the next was astounding. He couldn't  hold his head up any more. He tried to drink some water but couldn't manage to do it. I don't think  any additional intervention would have improved his condition. I  didn't want to wait any longer and had to act quickly.<br /><br />I was fortunate  to find a caring and compassionate vet who made house calls, and wasn't  ridiculously overboard on COVID-19 restrictions. Some said they wouldn't  enter the main living area — it had to take place outside or in the  garage or in their mobile van. But Max was in a comfortable and familiar  environment, at least. And then he didn't have to suffer any longer.<br /><br /><br />Max  was such a sweet, loving, affectionate cat. He sought me out until the  end, until his very last day when he was too weak to do so.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="212" data-original-width="432" height="157" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />This is another story of love, and of loss.

<br /><p><a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora 32</a> was released today after a full six
months of development. There are a lot of improvements and new changes included
in this release. You can read the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-32-2/">announcement here</a> and the complete
release notes <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release is particularly exciting for the NeuroFedora team. It also marks
the first release of our first deliverable: the CompNeuro Lab ISO image! The
aim of developing such ready to install ISO images that are packed with the
necessary tools is to enable users to quickly set up their computers and get
down to work, instead of wasting precious time and effort on installing tools
individually by hand. While we hope that this will enable researchers by
providing them easy access to Free/Open Source research tools, we also hope
that the platform will serve as a teaching aid in Computational Neuroscience
courses.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Our memories are not always reliable. But sometimes they’re rich, textured and vivid — even if they didn’t happen. Research has suggested false memories <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.993&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">often have the descriptive, multisensory elements of real memories</a>, a fact that obviously poses both interesting questions about memory itself and difficulties for those relying on eyewitness encounters for evidence.</p>
<p>But beyond the question of <em>how </em>people remember is another quandary: are we, as observers, able to tell whether someone’s memory is true or false? It’s a question tackled by UCL’s Julia Shaw <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00650/full">in a new study</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology —</em> and she finds that not only are we susceptible to having memories planted, we’re not very good at working out when someone else’s memory is false either.</p>
<p><span id="more-39534"></span>Shaw has worked on false memory and our susceptibility to it before. In 2015, she co-authored a paper that claimed to have successfully implanted false memories of having committed a crime in 70% of participants; these crimes ranged from petty theft to the much more serious assault with a weapon. Videos of these participants recalling true and false memories formed the stimuli for the new work.</p>
<p>(It’s important to note that the findings from Shaw’s 2015 study have been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/15/psychologists-clash-over-how-easy-it-is-to-implant-false-memories-of-committing-a-crime/">subject to much debate</a>, with some psychologists arguing that the coding scheme used in the study led to wildly inflated results. However, all videos of false memories included in <em>this</em> paper were also classified as false memories in a re-analysis by critics.)</p>
<p>In the first study, 124 participants saw videos of someone recalling both a real and a false memory of events that had (supposedly) happened during their adolescence. In one condition, participants saw the person recalling an emotive false memory (e.g. being attacked by an animal, being bullied or the death of a parent) while in the other condition, the false memory related to committing a crime (e.g. an assault with a weapon). Participants were told before watching the videos that “all, some, or none of the videos” involved memories of real accounts. Afterwards they were told one memory was real and one was false, and were asked to identify which was the false one.</p>
<p>In the second study, participants were shown the same videos <em>—</em> only this time, one set of participants watched the video with sound, one listened just to the audio, and a final set watched the video without audio.</p>
<p>The results suggest that participants are not better than chance at classifying false memories <em>—</em> about 57% of false memories were identified in the first study, and only 44% in the second. Numbers were similar across conditions: criminal false memories were identified 55% of the time in study one and 44% in study two. In study two, accuracy was highest when participants were given video with audio (53% accuracy) and worst with just audio (32%) .</p>
<p>Shaw argues that the study’s results demonstrate that false memories look real to an observer: even though participants knew that one memory was false and one was true, they were still unable to accurately tell the difference.</p>
<p>This could have serious implications for judges, police officers, lawyers and others involved with gathering evidence and interviewing eyewitnesses. Shaw <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/apr/false-memories-crime-appear-real-when-retold-others">points to judges in particular</a>, who should “never assume they can tell when someone has a false memory … and should consider the entire process to see if there was any risk of contamination of a defendant or witness’ memories.”</p>
<p>The results should almost be beside the point <em>—</em> judges, lawyers and police officers should <em>already</em> try to assume they can’t always tell whether someone’s memory is accurate or not. So it will be interesting to see exactly how these findings are taken by legal and law enforcement officials. Memory, for better or worse, is a key part of evidence; being cautious before we make any firm conclusions about it may be vital to ensuring that evidence is as watertight as possible.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though it may vary based on context or mood, most of us have a fairly steady belief in how intelligent we think we are. Whether that belief is in any way accurate or even helpful is a different questio<span>n</span><span> — one 2019 study found that </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/">people who were happier to admit they don’t know something actually had better general knowledge</a><span>, whilst a survey from the year before found that the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/">majority of Americans believed they were smarter than average</a><span>. We’re also susceptible to the same foibles when it comes to those close to us, tending to </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">rate our romantic partners as more intelligent than they actually are</a><span>. </span></p>
<p>But how early do our ideas about our own intelligence start, and how do they relate to other facets of our personality? In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new research published in </a><em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">Personality and Individual Differences</a>,</em> Marcin Zajenkowski looks at just that.</p>
<p><span id="more-39531"></span></p>
<p>The way we perceive our intelligence seems to have an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976">important</a><u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976"> effect on both academic achievement and how we feel about ourselves</a></u>. Though studies have largely focused on adults, Zajenkowski argues that this is also likely to be the case amongst teenagers, too, where some evidence has already suggested that self-perceived ability in Maths and English is correlated with actual achievement.</p>
<p>First, Zajenkowski asked 428 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 to rate their own intelligence compared to other people on a scale from 1 (very low) to 25 (very high). Next, they completed a test of objective intelligence which measured abstract and non-verbal reasoning.</p>
<p>Participants also completed a measure of the Big Five personality traits, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory was used to assess grandiose narcissism: participants rated themselves on 34 statements such as “I have a natural talent for influencing people” and “I will be a success”. Finally, participants rated their life satisfaction, rating how much they agreed or disagreed with sentiments including “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”.</p>
<p>Zajenkowski found that teenagers with higher levels of narcissism and those who scored higher on the “intellect” personality trait tended to make higher assessments of their own intelligence. These participants also showed greater levels of life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gender also played a part, with male students scoring significantly higher than female students on self-assessed intelligence, as well as narcissism, extraversion and life satisfaction. But, importantly, there was no gender difference in <em>objective </em>intelligence.</p>
<p>This mirrors what had already been found in adult populations (one researcher dubbed it the “male hubris, female humility” effect). It’s not clear when in development self-assessed intelligence starts to become associated with gender, though studies looking at only slightly younger children have found no gendered difference.</p>
<p>But unlike in studies on adults, there was no correlation between self-assessed intelligence and objective intelligence. Zajenkowski argues that this may be down to the way objective intelligence was measured: the test used in this study looked at abstract thinking, and  previous research has suggested that people may not see this kind of thinking as an aspect of intelligence until they’re of university age. Teenagers, therefore, may not value it or even see it as a facet of intelligence.</p>
<p>It could therefore be useful to include a wider range of IQ tests in future work. Firstly, this could provide a more comprehensive picture of intellect with which to compare self-assessed intelligence; secondly, it may be a better fit when it comes to how teenagers perceive what intelligence actually means.</p>
<p>Effort must also be made by educators and families to ensure that girls are just as confident and sure in their abilities and intelligence as boys. Not only might this increase well-being, it could disrupt negative gender stereotypes as it does so.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new urgency to openly and rapidly share and review COVID-19 research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organizations, are committing to work together on a cross-publisher rapid review and review transfer initiative. With the endorsement of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) we are making the following calls to reviewers, editors, authors, and publishers in the research community, in order to maximize the efficiency and speed of the triage and peer review process of COVID-19 research.</span></p>
<p><strong>To reviewers and authors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on volunteer reviewers with suitable expertise relevant to COVID-19 from all career stages and disciplines, including those from industry, to sign up to a “rapid reviewer pool” and commit to rapid reviewing times, along with an upfront agreement  that their reviews and identity can be shared among publishers and journals if submissions get rerouted. Please sign up in this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7MILluJtO9xV2QXznWVd66UQU4puow4wSk7iwLz7iYcykfA/viewform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on volunteer reviewers (whether or not they have signed up for rapid review) to identify and highlight important and crucial COVID-19 preprints (e.g. by using </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as early as possible, to optimise the limited time of expert reviewers who are subsequently invited to review the most important and promising research by a journal/platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on authors to support reviewers and publishers in this endeavour by ensuring the deposition of their submission as a preprint, and by working with publishers to make the peer-reviewed article and associated dataset, software, and model available for reuse as rapidly as possible.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To publishers and editors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers to actively facilitate posting of COVID-19 preprints to preprint servers with the agreement of the authors, if authors have not already posted a preprint. This should be after confirming the submission warrants further review. (It is understood preprint servers are also doing their own checks and triage.)  Preprint servers include, but are not limited to </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSF Preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://preprints.scielo.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SciELO Preprints etc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on research scope.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers and editors to consider comments on preprints during the journal peer-review process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers to ensure all COVID-19 submissions include a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data availability statement, if they do not already do this for all submissions. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers should aim to facilitate the stewardship of </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIR data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and software code sharing underlying prioritised COVID-19 papers (and associated preprints) during the pandemic by working with </span><a href="https://fairsharing.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIRsharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Research Data Alliance and Force11 via the joint </span><a href="https://rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RDA/Force11  FAIRsharing Working Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (e.g. providing recommendations to appropriate repositories and use of relevant data and metadata standards).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This call is in addition to supporting these Wellcome Trust-coordinated calls: “</span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers make coronavirus (COVID-19) content freely available and reusable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology/">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></h4>

<p>The scars of emotional abuse are invisible, deep, and diverse; and unfortunately, emotional abuse likely impacts more students than we think.</p><p>Emotionally abusive behavior broadly consists of criticism, degradation, rejection, or threat. Emotional abuse (also known as psychological maltreatment or verbal assault) can happen anywhere, both within and outside of families, and can refer to a single severe incident or a chronic, ongoing pattern. Educators, caregivers, coaches, school mental health professionals, administrators, and peers are all capable of acting emotionally abusive toward school-age youth. That is part of its insidious invisibility; despite emotional abuse being highly involved in childhood abuse cases, it is often forgotten and overlooked. This type of interpersonal trauma is typically chronic and cuts deeply, as it is associated with mental and physical health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, self-harm) during the school years and beyond.</p><p>Even with this existing knowledge, emotional abuse remains misunderstood, minimized, unseen, and unreported by many, including school professionals. We outline three things teachers need to know about emotional abuse and three things they can do to meet the needs of students experiencing emotional abuse.</p><p><em><strong>What to know</strong></em></p><p><strong>The impact on the student determines the occurrence of emotional abuse more than the behavior that caused it. </strong></p><p>There is no legal or clinical universal definition of emotional abuse. For example, two students with a parent teasing them about their appearances may react differently, in part based on context and relationship with the parent. Emotional abuse would be determined by the impact on the student, rather than the teasing alone.</p><p><strong>Emotional abuse is detrimental to both a student’s way of thinking and feeling. </strong></p><p>Children create their sense of self from stories that others construct about them. Students may believe the destructive narratives that are told to them. That is, these harmful words may impact students at their core—shifting how they think about themselves and the world, and how they feel about themselves and others.</p><p><strong>There are numerous ways that emotional abuse may manifest. </strong></p><p>Emotional abuse is not simply hearing harmful words. The context around the experience of emotional abuse are varied and diverse. A student may internalize or externalize their behaviors, or something in between. If a school-aged youth is repeatedly told that she is worthless, then the student may be meek in class. If a student is threatened repeatedly, then she may act aggressively toward others.</p><p><em><strong>What to do</strong></em></p><p><strong>Take care of your emotional needs and your emotional health.</strong></p><p>Educators cannot support students if they cannot support themselves. As some students may constantly hear emotionally destructive words in their home environments, teachers certainly do not want to bring any semblance of that into their schools. Nevertheless, working with students can be tiring and frustrating. If their emotional energy is low, teachers may react rather than respond to difficult situations that unexpectedly arise. Rather than taking a breath, teachers might begin to punitively scold or admonish a student. Teachers need to take care of their emotional needs so that they do not parallel any unhealthy at-home behaviors in the classroom.</p><p><strong>Foster sharing through strong relationships. </strong></p><p>Try to examine the life contexts behind a student’s behaviors. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with students, be curious about the circumstances in students’ lives that may influence how they act in school. To have a firmer understanding, teachers need to create brave spaces in our schools and classrooms so that students may feel comfortable sharing with adults. Students often regard educators as more effective guardians in violence protection than police or security, which speaks to the importance of continuing to cultivate this trust. When students share feelings, provide positive reinforcement by expressing your gratitude or by giving a thoughtful, affirming response.</p><p><strong>Know the laws around mandated reporting, and communicate with transparency.</strong></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/manda/">Check state regulations</a> and learn to whom to report and how to report within your district or county. If and when suspicion or reports of abuse arise, reach out to your school mental health professionals. Encourage your administrators to grow emotional abuse awareness, prevention, and intervention initiatives so that others feel willing to report even in instances of suspected abuse. Openly discuss what happens after a report is made, as this transparency allows for students to feel more comfortable with the idea of reporting.</p><p>Words are powerful, and as such, can be weaponized and wounding. Words can also be healing, spoken with gentleness and justice. Teachers should listen wholly to their students and their unstated needs; let teachers use their minds and words wisely and act knowingly.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Image by Okan AKGÜL on </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/apple-gift-teacher-book-classroom-4958609/"><em>Pixabay</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622374312/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/" rel="nofollow">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/" rel="nofollow">How to prepare for death</a></li></ul> </div>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory
representations.</p>

<p>This episode of <em>Brain Science</em> is an interview with neuroscientist Matthew Cobb author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3avdYDa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience."</a></p> <p>Cobb approaches the history of neuroscience from a different perspective than previous writers. He writes from the perspective of a working scientist with a deep interest in the history of ideas and the interaction between science and culture. This approach makes for a fascinating discussion.</p> <p>Through out history assumptions about the brain have been influenced by both culture and contemporary science. For example, before the discovery of electricity it was impossible to image that the brain uses both chemical and electrical signals to communicate. Similarly, our current understanding is heavily influenced by the computer metaphor, which actually misses much about how real brains function.</p> <p>Another aspect of our discussion involves several ongoing debates with neuroscience such as the importance of localization versus network properties. We also touch on the tendency toward neuromythology, which is the tendency to think that understanding the brain is the only tool for understanding what it means to be human.

<p><strong>Consumer-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have received a lot of hype in recent years — but many scientists are worried that the claims about what these devices can achieve don’t match the reality</strong>, <a href="https://undark.org/2020/04/22/brain-technology-interface/">reports Benjamin Powers</a> at <em>Undark</em>.

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>While waiting for the philharmonic orchestra to begin in the concert hall, you observe the people around you and wonder, “What made them come to this place?” The love of music? Snobbery? Conformism — because other friends do this? Or, maybe there are other, deeper motives? Similar questions arise when we think about what drives people to participate in pop culture and consume its products. Do they simply enjoy it? Scientists’ answers to this question can be surprising. For example, one study suggests that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/01/even-those-participants-who-claimed-pop-culture-is-unimportant-suffered-psychological-ill-effects-from-feeling-out-of-the-loop/">we consume pop culture because we suffer psychological ill effects from feeling out of the loop</a>.</p>
<p>But what drives people to become cultural omnivores, those who consume both “highbrow” <em>and</em> “lowbrow” culture? Hanna Shin and Nara Youn from Hongik University in Seoul recently <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000303">investigated</a> this question in a paper in <em>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39517"></span></p>
<p>Cultural omnivorousness is a relatively new phenomenon. Until the first half of the 20th century, participation in highbrow or lowbrow culture was clearly associated with social and economic status. Opera, symphony orchestra, and painting exhibitions are places traditionally included in highbrow culture. Street performances and graffiti are considered to be products of lowbrow culture. The former are usually credited with greater intellectual sophistication and artistic values, while the latter are often considered to be more authentic and of higher intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Shin and Youn wondered whether personality factors such as narcissism, self-esteem, and feelings of authenticity could explain how likely someone is to be a cultural omnivore. To find out, they conducted two studies. In the first, they tested 178 undergraduate students, asking them to complete the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and a measure of self-esteem, as well as a scale that measured their distinction-seeking drive: that is, the desire to stand out. Participants were also asked to indicate their intentions to participate in highbrow and lowbrow cultural activities (e.g. “visiting art galleries” and “going to pop concerts”, respectively).</p>
<p>The results showed that participants who scored high in narcissism and <em>also</em> had low self-esteem tended to be cultural omnivores. These “insecure narcissists” seemed to be driven to consume both high- and lowbrow culture because of their desire to distinguish themselves from others.</p>
<p>In the second study, Shin and Youn explored more specific motivations for insecure narcissists’ cultural omnivorousness. The researchers created two biographies of a fictional artist: in the highbrow condition, the biography stated that the artist’s paintings had been displayed in major museums around the world, while in the lowbrow condition it stated the paintings were kept by family and later discovered by a collector. One hundred and forty-four undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions and completed scales of personality. After they had reviewed the applicable biography and viewed two examples of the artist’s paintings, they rated the paintings as highbrow or lowbrow, and indicated how likely they would be to visit or recommend an exhibition of the artist’s work. Finally, they completed scales of status-seeking motivations.</p>
<p>The results suggested that insecure narcissists had different reasons for consuming highbrow and lowbrow art. When they believed the paintings were highbrow, their intention to visit or recommend the exhibition seemed to be driven by a desire to consume status-seeking products . But when they believed the paintings were lowbrow, their intention to consume the art was fuelled instead by a desire to signal self-integrity.</p>
<p>The research adds much to the understanding of the motives for one’s participation in culture, going beyond the narrow focus on economic status. The results suggest at least one psychological mechanism underlying cultural omnivorousness: a combination of narcissism and psychological insecurity, which is related to a drive to signal both status and self-integrity.</p>
<p>But it also leaves many questions to be answered. How valid is the division between highbrow and lowbrow contemporary culture: is the appearance of cultural omnivores not the result of blurring the boundaries between these two types of cultures? Does a laboratory experiment reflect the complexity of motives that push us to participate in culture? Finally, are the examined motives and personality traits the most important? There is certainly still much to be done in this research area, and studies that include more psychological variables and factors could definitely enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Syrian-Doctor-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece or interned in deplorable and dramatic conditions on Greek islands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html">[1]</a>. This drama painfully reminds us that the conflict in Syria continues to be the biggest driver of migration. Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian migrants have crossed into Europe. Syrians are now the third-largest group of people with a foreign nationality in Germany, and among Syrian immigrants, there are comparatively many well-educated and trained health care professionals, e.g. some 3,000-4,000 medical doctors <a href="https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/ueber-uns/aerztestatistik/aerztestatistik-2018">[2]</a>. Not all of them have fled their country as refugees; many have been granted visas, as Germany is principally welcoming Syrian doctors.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Germany needs Syrian doctors</strong></h3>
<p>The reason is simple: In Germany, a relative shortage of physicians has developed over the recent years. A change in working time regulations and a growing demand for part-time jobs, has increased the need for additional doctors. Like many other developed countries, Germany relies on international medical graduates or doctors to supplement its locally trained staff so as to maintain their health care system. Further, as the number of Syrian migrants increases, so does the number of Syrian patients being treated in hospitals and doctors’ offices, resulting in a novel need for Arabic-speaking medical staff. Therefore, Syrian doctors are able to fulfill a double function.</p>
<p>Given this background, it may seem paramount to make the licensure process for Syrian immigrant doctors as straightforward and as swift as possible, actively supporting and advising applicants through the relevant processes. But in fact, the act of obtaining a permanent license to be allowed to practice medicine in Germany is onerous, lengthy, and can bring about many negative experiences. These can include feelings of humiliation, lack of transparency, arbitrariness, and helplessness. This is what many of the 20 Syrian doctors told us in an interview study we performed from 2016-2017.</p>
<h3><strong>Syrian doctors in Germany and their stories: the basis of our study</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05209-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">this study</a> arose when a recently immigrated Syrian dentist, began working with us while waiting for his German dental license to be approved.</p>
<p>He told our team about his experiences with a “bureaucratic”, slow and confusing application procedure to secure his license. We were intrigued by his experiences and wanted to seek out other Syrian health care professionals’ experiences of the system. A qualitative study was designed and we received an overwhelming response to our call for interviewees on a Facebook page for Syrian Doctors in Germany. Within a few days, twenty Syrian health professionals were prepared to share their stories through face-to-face interviews.</p>
<h3><strong>Being lost in an opaque and arbitrary bureaucratic process: that’s what it feels like being a Syrian doctor applying for a medical license in Germany</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that upon arrival in Germany, Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p>
<p>One physician explained: “<em>When I started applying for the temporary license … some rules changed and the authorities were now requiring a C1 course in medical German to obtain the temporary license! After I started the C1 language course, they required the exam for medical terms. When we completed one step, they asked for another step…nothing is stable here.</em>”</p>
<p>Interviewees describe a Kafkaesque system where they feel at the mercy of Government employees and reviewers who ask for absurd and impossible accomplishments, refuse to give information and act at random. This is shown in the quote of another interview partner: “<em>There are no clear steps. You can have two [Syrian] doctors who studied at the same university, finished their studies in the same year, – and then one of them can obtain the approbation without any exam, and the other one will need to take another exam. At the end of the day, only one person makes the decision about you. …And of course, we cannot meet this person or talk with them. We don’t even know their name.”</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11846" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Admin work" class="size-medium wp-image-11846" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/pexels-photo-52608-300x201.jpeg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair with the medical license application process.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Consequently, the interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair. As informational and practical support from official institutions was scarce, the Syrian doctors relied on personal networks and peers to understand the requirements and find a job.</p>
<h3><strong>Where next?</strong></h3>
<p>To obtain a balanced view of the licensure process and the interactions involved, future research should explore the perspective of the administrative staff in the German Chamber of Physicians or job centers as well. Naturally, these regulative bodies were not prepared for the large number of migrant doctors applying for a license and were surprised by the abrupt rise in the number of licensure procedures. Journalists have reported that ratifying Syrian diplomas may be difficult because in some cases, fraudulent documents have been provided <a href="https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/innenministerium-warnt-falsche-zeugnisse-und-diplome-fluechtlinge-koennen-im-libanon-antragspakete-kaufen_id_5066196.html">[3</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/europe/germany-refugees-doctors.html">4]</a>. For the medical profession, in particular, credentials and certificates should be checked thoroughly and carefully. Nevertheless, Germany may learn from other countries such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, which have harmonized and simplified assessment procedures for overseas-trained doctors, and implemented specific resources guiding and supporting foreign health professionals in different stages of their application process <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/8/nationally-consistent-assessment-international-medical-graduates">[5</a>,<a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-016-0135-6">6]</a>.</p>
<p>Welcoming Syrian doctors in Germany is more important than ever – especially as the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for skilled medical staff in hospitals. While German authorities claim to be making an effort to find as many helping hands as possible to cope with the impending shortage of health care professionals, there are no signs that the accreditation process of foreign doctors – Syrian doctors among them – may be accelerated, or handled in a more pragmatic way <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/despite-coronavirus-foreign-doctors-struggle-to-get-degrees-recognized-in-germany/a-52966674">[7]</a>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>For many, running a marathon is seen as the ultimate amateur athletic achievement; for others, it’s just the start. Ultramarathon runners often take on courses of incredibly impressive length, running 50 or 100 kilometres at one time or over several days.</p>
<p>Clearly this is physically demanding, and only those in seriously good shape will be able to take on such challenges — ultramarathon running involves stress on muscles and bones, blisters, dehydration, sleep deprivation and mental and physical fatigue, so it’s really not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>But what about the psychological traits that make someone suitable for long-distance running? What kind of person can withstand this kind of physical stress, and how? A <a href="https://aps.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajpy.12287?af=R">new study</a> in the <em>Australian Journal of Psychology</em> takes a look.<span id="more-39510"></span></p>
<p>Gregory Roebuck from Monash University and colleagues recruited 20 ultrarunners and 20 control participants aged between 18 and 70; runners were matched with non-runners by gender and age. Participants were asked about their exercise behaviours and running experiences before completing a number of questionnaires. These included a 25-item scale designed to measure resilience (with participants rating how much they agreed with statements such as “I am able to adapt when changes occur”), and two questionnaires that looked at emotion regulation — the ways a person moderates or expresses their emotion. Finally, a 155-item questionnaire looked at a range of personality traits across domains like well-being, achievement, stress reaction, and, aggression.</p>
<p>Next, participants took part in an emotion regulation task, viewing 36 neutral images (e.g. a sofa or chair) and 36 negative images (e.g. a bloody medical scene). Before viewing each image, participants were asked to either respond naturally to it (a “look” trial) or attempt to not have a negative reaction to it (a “decrease” trial), before rating the strength of their emotional response. Heart rate and skin conductance were measured during this section of the experiment.</p>
<p>Ultrarunners scored significantly higher on the resilience questionnaire than non-runners, and were more likely to indicate they used positive reappraisal when regulating their emotions — in other words, they were better able to reframe a situation with a positive angle. This may be down to the need to maintain high levels of motivation during races, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/29/a-mental-technique-calledcognitive-reappraisal-makes-long-distance-running-feel-easier">attaching positive meaning to negative events in order to keep running</a>.</p>
<p>There was also a physiological difference between ultrarunners and non-runners in the emotion regulation task, with ultrarunners showing reduced skin conductance and heart rate even when viewing unpleasant images. However, they didn’t show any differences in their ability to decrease their response to negative images.</p>
<p>There was one measure on which ultrarunners scored lower, however — affiliative extraversion, which measures how socially warm people are, which the team puts down to the high levels of solitude involved in long-distance running.  There was no significant difference in any of the other measures.</p>
<p><span>The results suggest that ultrarunners are pretty similar to the rest of us — with some important differences. While it’s clear that ultrarunners are indeed more resilient than non-runners, and use different emotion regulation strategies, the direction of those relationships is not yet clear. It could be that training for ultramarathons makes people more resilient, or, on the other hand, it could be that people with higher levels of resilience are more likely to be attracted to the pastime.</span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to further explore how ultrarunners motivate themselves through many hours of pain and effort. Because even though most of us will never run 100 kilometres in one go (and may have no desire to, either), understanding how to tolerate pain, and cope with physical and mental fatigue, is a lesson we all could benefit from.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/chaos-485491_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Since the early 2000’s there has been growing interest in the phenomenon of household chaos and how it impacts on the well-being and development of children. Yet despite this interest, no review has been conducted that comprehensively brings the existing literature together. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08587-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">systematic scoping review</a> we have published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> aims to address this gap.</p>
<h4>What we found</h4>
<p>With remarkable consistency, increased chaos in a child’s home, defined as high levels of background noise (e.g. from TV), constant rushing, and environmental commotion and confusion, negatively impacted on almost every child outcome investigated, from cognitive and academic performance, to stress physiology, and socio-emotional well-being.</p>
<h4>Chaos and parenting</h4>
<p>So how could household chaos have such far-ranging implications for the well-being of children? An important clue lies in the relationship between chaos and parenting behaviors. We found that, yet again with remarkable consistency, greater chaos was associated with increased parent-child conflict, reduced closeness in the parent-child relationship, less supportive parenting practices, and less responsive parenting. And as research has confirmed, the quality of the parent-child relationship is intricately linked to the well-being of the child.</p>
<h4>Slowing down childhood</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11837 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/children-403583_640-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Improving child well-being by slowing down the lives of children is not a new concept. Outside academia a number of groups and social movements advocate for the realignment of family time with the ‘pace of childhood’ – a pace that is much slower than the pace of the hurried, modern world children find themselves in. These approaches encourage simplification of a child’s life, through the paring back of unnecessary activities, toys, and digital media, in addition to the promotion of daily rhythms and routines known to support well-being. In short, the focus shifts away from activities that disrupt the flow of family life, and instead focuses on activities that promote parent-child communication and free play (but not computer games!), and support development of warm relationships.</p>
<h4>Research gaps</h4>
<p>Yet despite a push from outside academia to simplify the lives of children, and evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies linking chaos with poor child outcomes, we still don’t know whether reducing household chaos will have a positive impact. We also don’t know how to reduce chaos, as no studies have attempted to do this. And importantly, it still remains to be seen whether we can go too far in the other direction, resulting in a home environment that is overly structured and controlled, to the point that it lacks warmth and the opportunity for supportive and caring parent-child relationships to develop.</p>
<h4>Household chaos in the time of COVID-19</h4>
<p>At the time of undertaking the review, we could not have predicted the situation we currently find <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11838" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/table-3281047_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />ourselves in. Children around the world are spending an unprecedented amount of time at home. While we don’t know whether children living in low-chaos households will fare better, intuitively, we might expect they will. These children will likely have greater opportunities to complete their home-schooling tasks in a less distracting environment. They will also likely have more time dedicated to free, non-screen based play – the kind of play that supports their emotional well-being and development. And perhaps most importantly, there is the chance that they will have greater exposure to supportive and positive parenting practices. As such, lower household chaos in the time of COVID-19 may provide an environment more conducive to the promotion of resilience and child well-being. A unique opportunity has thus presented itself to investigate not only how low levels of chaos protect children from exposure to adversity, but also whether we can effectively reduce household chaos levels to promote better outcomes across the board for our children.</p>

<p>Megan Peters, Konrad Kording and the people behind <a href="https://neuromatch.io/">neuromatch</a> are building an online summer school for computational neuroscience (July 13 – 31st). If you’re reading this blog – chances are you should be a student in this class or a TA. It’s going to be awesome! 3 straight weeks of computational neuro education. Designed for PhD student or postdoc experimentalists in mind, what sets it apart is matching, the same technology behind neuromatch. Become part of small tight-knit group of trainees with similar interests – bond, share, learn. But wait, there’s more:</p>



<ul><li>Low TA to student ratio (6-10)</li><li>Lectures with world-class computational neuroscientists</li><li>Tutorials in Python, cloud-based in Google Colab: take your theoretical knowledge and apply to your own data</li><li>Inclusive: 100$ tuition (waivable)</li></ul>



<p>I loved summer school (CSHL computational neuroscience: vision). I made some life-long friends and have memories to last a lifetime. We want it to be better than a real-life summer school. Better by being more inclusive, matching you with more diverse people, offering multiple levels of support, and being accessible to people at different stages in their career.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HQC_UMT8BZBpPwbkID5l8pNOVKaSMzzz0xP2_xd0No/">Syllabus is here</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen1oyFWIQ38vlBSxUdlWU4AwQ_UYGqQZcGAS_cEmMdN6cdNw/viewform">Student form is here</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4aL49WV_dnt7WlXjEwsY8Mb30I2E0VHa8LROYPcmmwkzLdw/viewform">TA form is here</a>. YOU HAVE UNTIL APRIL 27 TO SIGN UP, DO IT NOW.</p>



<h2>Teaching at scale</h2>



<p>Most real-life elite education is expensive and exclusive. In online education, it’s possible to scale to huge audiences for a fraction of the cost, and let everybody in – including people of disadvantaged backgrounds. MOOCs can have excellent learning materials – better production values, materials that resist the test of time, scannable lectures. Training educators in the latest methods can be done at scale.</p>



<p>The biggest disadvantage of MOOCs is high attrition – up to 95% of people that sign up for MOOCs drop out. New models are appearing that have the accessibility of online learning and the critical social component of real-life learning. At Stanford, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami started Code in Place, an effort to bring CS education to people at home during covid19 times. It’s a massive effort – 8,000 students from all over the world accompanied by 800 section leaders (including me!). Several factors have kept dropout to a minimum (&lt; 20% after 2 weeks):</p>



<ul><li>A low TA-to-student ratio</li><li>matching TAs to students based on learner characteristic (age, location)</li><li>engaging materials</li><li>a very high standard for TAs (Top affiliations are Stanford, Google and MIT)</li><li>a tough preparatory assignment to make sure the students entering class were motivated</li></ul>



<p>I was very excited when Konrad announced that they were working on a summer school, fresh off my Code in Place experience, so I contacted him and have joined the team to help (in a small way) organize this thing. There are a handful of experiments in teaching computational neuroscience at scale, the most successful in my opinion being the <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal Dynamics online book, tutorials, and lectures</a>. Imagine that, plus TAs, your own wolf pack, live Q&amp;A – community. That’s what we’re aiming for.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Picture the scene: you’re attending a regular medical checkup, fielding questions about your health and lifestyle, when your doctor tells you they can accurately estimate your life expectancy from your answers. Would you want to hear the truth, no matter how brutal it might be? Or would you prefer to live in ignorance?</p>
<p>If you belong to the latter category, you’re not alone. A <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3543">new study</a> in <em>Management Science </em>has found that many of us would rather avoid stressful or uncomfortable truths — even if they might benefit us.</p>
<p><span id="more-39504"></span>To find out who is most likely to avoid information and why, Emily Ho from Fordham University and colleagues first presented 380 participants with a series of scenarios designed to test their desire for knowledge about a situation that could have a favourable or unfavourable outcome for them. The scenarios replicated situations that participants were likely to have encountered in the past and fell into three broad categories: personal health, finances, and other people’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Participants were asked whether they would want to look at how well a missed investment opportunity was performing, for example, whether or not they’d want to know their risk for a particular medical condition, or if they’d want to know the truth about how well a speech had gone. (If you’re interested in finding out your own tendency to avoid information, you can see all the scenarios and take the test <a href="https://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oYP0OROwDv1f2l">here</a>). Participants’ personality traits were also measured.</p>
<p>Information avoidance was incredibly common: on average, participants indicated that they would definitely or probably not want to receive information 32% of the time. Overall, these figures were fairly stable across domains: an average of 24% would prefer not to know if a friend hated a book given as a gift, for instance, whilst 29% would avoid finding out the impact stress had had on their long-term health. Even among those who were more likely to want to hear potentially troubling information, there was often at least one domain in which they opted to remain uninformed.</p>
<p>Participants’ likelihood of avoiding information wasn’t associated with their gender, income, age or education. However, it was related to particular personality traits: those higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to new experiences tended to seek information more, while those with high neuroticism scores showed a higher likelihood of wanting to stay in the dark.</p>
<p>A second study, which saw participants rate the scenarios again, four weeks apart, suggested their responses remain stable over time.</p>
<p>A final study looked at participants’ real-world behaviour. In this case, two weeks after completing the initial survey on information avoidance, participants were given the option to be sent to a website containing potentially valuable information that they might be motivated to avoid: for instance, an occupational website that compared average salaries between men and women, or a health site informing people about their individual risk of burnout.</p>
<p>Results suggested that participants’ tendency to avoid information as measured by the survey did have an impact on real-world decisions: avoidant and seeking scores correlated with the decision to avoid or read information respectively.</p>
<p>The findings may have important uses: understanding in which situations people tend to ignore or avoid information could be vital for organisations or governments sending out public service information, for example.</p>
<p>We already knew, to some extent, that there are cases where people avoid information — interventions that seek to improve financial literacy tend to have smaller impacts than hoped, for example, partly because some people feel so anxious about money they’ll go out of their way to avoid thinking about it. Building this knowledge into the design of social interventions may be a useful way to approach such individual differences in information seeking.</p>

<p><em>A guest post by Meredith Drosback, Becky Hazen, &amp; Rick Weiss</em></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.</p>
<p>While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists">SciLine</a>, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>BEFORE</em> AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject <em>evidence</em> into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and <em>then</em> get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not rude to say to a journalist, <em>“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” </em>or <em>“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” </em>or <em>“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”</em>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: <em>“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” </em>or <em>“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” </em>or <em>“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” </em></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, <em>“No comment,” </em>which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, <em>“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.</em></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.</p>
<p>It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/c09QPKkpto4/">The importance of being second – PLOS-wide edition</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  </span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t have to be like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pioneered an expanded </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘complementary research’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eloquently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see for example PLOS Genetics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/nDqUcrlWHhs/">PLOS Stands with the National Academies on Continuing WHO Funding</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p>Yesterday, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/04/us-funding-for-world-health-organization-should-not-be-interrupted-during-covid-19-pandemic-say-presidents-of-the-nas-nae-and-nam"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">statement</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> warning that interrupting funding for World Health Organization (WHO) would be a critical failure for our global health security. PLOS stands with the assessment of our nation’s top scientists: this is not a time to turn inward, but to collaborate for immediate, robust and concentrated international action. </span></p>
<p>As the <i>PLOS Medicine</i> editors indicate in a <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2020/04/16/we-need-to-support-the-who-not-stop-its-funding-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">perspective</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, the WHO is the only global health organization that has the tools to combat a pandemic of truly global consequences.</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">To halt funding now would risk the lives of many who rely on the WHO’s essential services and debilitate our collective progress towards understanding the virus and curbing the impact of the pandemic.</span></p>

<h4>How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg" />Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay</figure><p>We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>. Despite dating their last common ancestor with <em>Homo sapiens</em> to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in <em>Neuroscientus</em>. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.</p><p>Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics</p><h4>Mimics</h4><p>There are a number of species that attempt to mimic <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:</p><p><strong>Neurobollocker</strong></p><p>Sapiens that append the prefix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.</p><p><strong>Cranks</strong></p><p>A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em> sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.</p><h4>Sub-species</h4><p><strong>The Electrophysiologist</strong></p><p>The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other <em>Neuroscientus</em> by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.</p><p><strong>The Systems Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.</p><p>Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).</p><p><strong>The Cognitive Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:</p><p>Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.</p><p>Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.</p><p>The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).</p><p><strong>The Neuroanatomist</strong><br />Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.</p><p><strong>Neural Engineer</strong><br />Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.</p><p><strong>Behavioural Neuroscientist</strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).</p><p><strong>Neuroethologist </strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.</p><p><strong>Neuroendocrinologist</strong><br />Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.</p><p><strong>Molecular neuroscientist </strong><br />Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.</p><p><strong>Neurogeneticist</strong><br />Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.<br /> <br /><strong>Clinical Neuroscientist </strong><br />Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.</p><p><strong>Computational Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.</p><p>Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).</p><p>The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.</p><p>Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.</p><p>The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.</p><p><strong>Karl Friston</strong><br />Unclassifiable.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology/">The importance of character during war</a></h4>

<p>Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.</p><p>Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.</p><p>In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.</p><p>Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.</p><p>Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.</p><p>Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.</p><p>Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.</p><p>Featured photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Vladislav Nikonov</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/">The importance of character during war</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/" rel="nofollow">How to prepare for death</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/quantitative-thinking-during-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Quantitative thinking during a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/the-life-and-legacy-of-florence-nightingale-timeline/" rel="nofollow">The life and legacy of Florence Nightingale [timeline]</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why we like a good robot story</a></h4>

<p>Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.</p><p>This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.</p><p>In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.</p><p>Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.</p><p>At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.</p><p>But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.</p><p>This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.</p><p>Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”</p><p>But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.</p><p>Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.</p><p>Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8">Research </a>also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.</p><p>Isaac Asimov’s book, <em>I, Robot</em>, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.</p><p>All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”</p><ul><li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li><li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li></ul><p>But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.</p><p><em>I, Robot</em> stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.</p><p>The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, <em>I, Robot</em>, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.</p><p>Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics">granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship</a>. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.</p><p>Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.</p><p>Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001">one study</a> has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.</p><p>Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641">foresees a future</a> in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”</p><p>And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.</p><p>This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Andy Kelly from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/">Why we like a good robot story</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/is-collecting-medical-data-really-essential-for-health-care/" rel="nofollow">Is collecting medical data really essential for health care?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/04/will-robots-really-take-our-jobs/" rel="nofollow">Will robots really take our jobs?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/how-to-prepare-for-death/" rel="nofollow">How to prepare for death</a></li></ul> </div>

At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html">173 countries</a>, causing <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4">972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths</a>. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins">clinical trials</a> are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.</p>
<p>Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png" width="191" />Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732">Domestic violence</a>, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, <a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/">one in three women</a> experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1">4-12% </a>during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during <a href="https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588">emergencies</a> in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1">US</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC">globally</a>. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">from a diverse set of countries</a> and cultures, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">USA</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france">France</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19">Australia</a>, <a href="https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/">Nepal</a>, <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html">India</a>, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">South Africa</a>, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.</p>
<p>To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf">most common form</a> of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802">across generations</a>.</p>
<p>Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration</p></blockquote>
<p>First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/">livelihood loss</a> by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html">marital conflicts</a>. <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/">Cognitive burdens</a> (preoccupation with financial woes impedes <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11831" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg" width="300" />one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf">mental models</a>” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x">substance use</a> (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.</p>
<p>Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.</p>
<p>Third, homebound for long, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html">couples</a>, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints</p></blockquote>
<p>As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.</p>
<p>First, a financial safety net (for example, <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=carsey">unemployment insurance in the US</a>, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms">women</a>, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg" width="256" />y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study">legal protection against domestic violence</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">global surge</a> in domestic violence could be <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls">costly</a>, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Z4cGSKXgFrY/">Learning how we can support researchers during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a couple of caveats.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Survey Structure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Survey-Chart-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953" height="436" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png" width="1024" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the scale of the impact?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.</span></p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42952" style="width: 600px;"><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/chart.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42952 size-full" height="371" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/chart.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749</figure><p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.</span></p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42954" style="width: 600px;"><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/chart-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42954 size-full" height="371" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/chart-1.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work</figure><p></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Serving authors on the front lines</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining priorities for career advancement</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a </span><a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate clearly to academics and researchers how they will modify research evaluation procedures for hiring, promotion, and tenure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS fully supports this appeal and urges all institutions and funders to join those who have already </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5REApf-t-76UXh8TKAGoLlwy8WIMfSSyqCJbb5u9lA/edit#gid=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consider similar policies to let researchers know that their careers will not grind to a halt due to the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to continue reviewing, editing, or revising manuscripts in process at PLOS, </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/03/a-message-to-our-community-regarding-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we encourage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you to reach out to the journal for an extension so that you can take the time you need to focus on other concerns.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is another way we can help support the communication and discovery of research as your publishing needs change, please consider sharing your thoughts by emailing us at </span><a href="mailto:community@pos.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community@plos.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by responding to </span><a href="https://surveys.plos.org/s3/covid-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. </span></p>

Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction<div id="content"><p>Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/">QuantLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine">Open Source Risk Engine</a> (ORE), <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system">libbitcoin</a>and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc99cdfe"><h2 id="orgc99cdfe">About</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc99cdfe"><p>Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a <i>deep understanding</i>of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: <i>wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. </p></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orge684ba8"><h2 id="orge684ba8">Legalese</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge684ba8"><p>As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></h4>

<p>Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up">Introduction to Psychology</a>, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology</em> in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”</p><p>Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html">Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It</a>” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.</p><p>Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.</p><figure><img height="354" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg" width="607" />Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.</figure><p>Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness"><em>The Question of Animal Awareness</em></a> of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.</p><p>To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf"><em>Investigation of Mind in Animals</em></a> by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as <em>Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses</em>. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.</p><figure><img height="398" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg" width="587" />Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls. Used with permission from Penn State Library.</figure><p>World War II fully exposed the catastrophic cost of national arrogance. International science advanced in its wake. Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.</p><p><em>Featured image from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/the-life-and-legacy-of-florence-nightingale-timeline/" rel="nofollow">The life and legacy of Florence Nightingale [timeline]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/envisioning-a-post-crisis-world/" rel="nofollow">Envisioning a post-crisis world</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/" rel="nofollow">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/02/scraping-webpages-with-developer-tools-and-selenium/">Scraping webpages with developer tools and Selenium</a></h4>

<p>There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.</p>



<h2>Identifying targets with developer tools</h2>



<p>Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:</p>



<ul><li>Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage</li><li>See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript</li><li>Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage</li><li>Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML</li></ul>



<p>These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.</p>



<p>Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7487" data-attachment-id="7487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scraping" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png" data-orig-size="3070,1752" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/scraping/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>Here I find that the biggest headline is a <code>span</code> with a class name of <code>balancedHeadline</code>. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.</p>



<h2>Selenium: remote control browsers</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium</a>: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></code> to grab the data and parsing it with <code><a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup</a></code>. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:</p>



<ul><li>is dynamically loaded</li><li>is hidden behind authentication layers</li><li>requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript</li></ul>



<p>In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">pip install selenium</pre>



<p>Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html">I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">downloading the gecko webdriver</a> and extracting the binary to <code>/usr/bin</code>. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

</pre>


<p>Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7477" data-attachment-id="7477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nytimes-robot" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png" data-orig-size="2176,192" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" />A remote-controlled version of Firefox</figure>



<p>We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: </p>



<ul><li>We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   <code>document.querySelectorAll("span.balancedHeadline")</code> to grab the headline</li><li>We could read the DOM to find the right span</li></ul>



<p>Let’s use the second method:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h2>Running headless and automating</h2>



<p>Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h3>Cron job</h3>



<p>All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called <code>headless-browser</code>, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;&amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;&amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
</pre>


<p>I saved this file as <code>/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh</code>. Running  <code>crontab -e</code>, I added an entry that looks like this:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate"># m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
</pre>


<p><a href="https://crontab.guru/">You can use this website</a> to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating">you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service</a> instead.</p>



<h2>Authentication</h2>



<p>A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with <code>.default</code> with:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
</pre>


<p>In my case, I found a directory called <code>lasd74g9.default</code>. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()

</pre>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/">is limited</a>, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.</p>
<p><strong>Our studies </strong></p>
<p>In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png" width="157" />and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.</p>
<p>Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11812" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Content analysis</strong></p>
<p>We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.</p>
<p>Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Are our results surprising?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.</p>
<blockquote><p>HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.</p>
<p>This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/">alcohol</a> and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/">energy-dense snacks</a>. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru will talk about her project named "Cyberspecies Proximity" on which she is working together with Alex May.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.</p>
<p>The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.</p>
<p>The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.</p>
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.</p>
