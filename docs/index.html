              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-nervous-system-brain-cells-digest-feed">Brainless sponges contain early echoes of a nervous system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brains are like sponges, slurping up new information. But sponges may also be a little bit like brains.</p>



<p>Sponges, which are humans’ very distant evolutionary relatives, don’t have nervous systems. But a detailed analysis of sponge cells turns up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abj2949">what might just be an echo of our own brains</a>: cells called neuroids that crawl around the animal’s digestive chambers and send out messages, researchers report in the Nov. 5 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The finding not only gives clues about the early evolution of more complicated nervous systems, but also raises many questions, says evolutionary biologist Thibaut Brunet of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is just the beginning,” he says. “There’s a lot more to explore.”</p>



<p>The cells were lurking in <em>S</em><em>pongilla lacustris</em>, a freshwater sponge that grows in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. “We jokingly call it the Godzilla of sponges” because of the rhyme with <em>Spongilla</em>, say Jacob Musser, an evolutionary biologist in Detlev Arendt’s group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>



<p>Simple as they are, these sponges have a surprising amount of complexity, says Musser, who helped pry the sponges off a metal ferry dock using paint scrapers. “They’re such fascinating creatures.”</p>

<p>With sponges procured, Arendt, Musser and colleagues looked for genes active in individual sponge cells, ultimately arriving at a list of 18 distinct kinds of cells, some known and some unknown. Some of these cells used genes that are essential to more evolutionarily sophisticated nerve cells for sending or receiving messages in the form of small blobs of cellular material called vesicles.</p>



<p>One such cell, called a neuroid, caught the scientists’ attention. After seeing that this cell was using those genes involved in nerve cell signaling, the researchers took a closer look. A view through a confocal microscope turned up an unexpected locale for the cells, Musser says. “We realized, ‘My God, they’re in the digestive chambers.’”</p>



<p>Large, circular digestive structures called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/possible-ancestor-sponges-found">choanocyte chambers</a> help move water and nutrients through sponges’ canals, in part by beating hairlike cilia appendages (<em>SN: 3/9/15</em>). Neuroids were hovering around some of these cilia, the researchers found, and some of the cilia near neuroids were bent at angles that suggested that they were no longer moving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="423" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg" alt="a purple neuroid cell next to an aqua digestive cell" class="wp-image-3105495" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-800x423.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-680x359.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-330x174.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1-768x406.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_LS_sponge-brain_inline-1.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105495">A neuroid cell (colored purple in this electron micrograph image) gets close to a digestive cell (aqua) in a sponge’s feeding chamber.

<p>The team suspects that these neuroids were sending signals to the cells charged with keeping the sponge fed, perhaps using vesicles to stop the movement of usually undulating cilia. If so, that would be a sophisticated level of control for an animal without a nervous system.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that sponges are using bits and bobs of communications systems that ultimately came together to work as brains of other animals. Understanding the details might provide clues to how nervous systems evolved. “What did animals have, before they had a nervous system?” Musser asks. “There aren’t many organisms that can tell us that. Sponges are one of them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-science-next-10-years-decadal-survey">Here’s what the next 10 years of space science could look like</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey is basically a sneak preview of the next 10 years of U.S. space science. Every decade, experts assembled by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine collect input from astronomers nationwide to recommend a prioritized list of projects to policy makers and federal agencies. Past to-do lists have been topped by specific big-ticket items, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/celestial-wish-list">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: </em><em>10/6/21; SN: 8/13/10</em>). But this year, astronomers are shaking things up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/26141">latest decadal survey</a>, which charts the course for U.S. astronomy and astrophysics from 2022 to 2032, recommends that NASA create a new program to develop several major space telescopes at a time. Investing early in multiple mission concepts could curb the risk of individual missions becoming too unwieldy and expensive, according to the report released November 4.</p>



<p>“These are super important recommendations,” says Scott Gaudi, an astronomer at the Ohio State University who wasn’t on the National Academies committee that compiled the report. “They really focus the direction of astronomy in the United States — and sort of by extension the rest of the world, because we have lots of international partnerships.”</p>



<p>The proposed multi-mission program would reshape how major space missions are planned. In the past, “you would pick a priority, you’d build it, you’d launch it, and then you would think about what the next priority was,” says Jonathan Fortney, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a member of the survey committee.</p>





<p>But space telescopes are getting more ambitious, complex and expensive, Fortney says. The one-at-a-time model doesn’t work so well when a single mission can take decades from blueprint to blastoff.</p>



<p>Having several big projects in the works offers a bit of insurance. If researchers work on one mission for a few years and realize that the technology isn’t there to make it fly on time, NASA could switch gears and send another telescope to space first, Fortney says. Developing multiple missions in parallel could also shrink the long wait time between launches.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited by that. It’s like the best possible outcome,” Gaudi says. This setup could boost confidence that big space missions can stay on budget and on schedule, he adds, after the large cost overruns and delays that have mired the long-awaited James Webb Space Telescope. “It is a really new way of approaching things, and one that’s really needed to advance astronomy into the next few decades.”</p>



<p>The first mission in the new program, according to the survey report, should be a space telescope that views the universe in infrared, optical and ultraviolet wavelengths, filling a gap left by other instruments. The Hubble Space Telescope mainly looks at optical and ultraviolet light, while the James Webb telescope will primarily see the universe in infrared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg" alt="illustration of the James Webb Space Telescope" class="wp-image-3105486" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-714x450.jpg 714w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-608x383.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-295x186.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline-920x580.jpg 920w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110421_MT_decal-survey_inline.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105486">Astronomers’ top-ranked priority in the 2001 decadal survey, the James Webb Space Telescope (illustrated), is finally slated to launch in December.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105486">Northrop Grumman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>With a light-collecting area more than twice as wide as Hubble’s, this newfangled observatory could glimpse planets in other star systems that are a tenth of a billionth as bright as their stars, and could tease out the specific wavelengths of light, or spectra, given off by exoplanets. The telescope could also observe stars, galaxies and other celestial objects. With an estimated price tag of $11 billion, the telescope would be slated to launch in the early 2040s.</p>



<p>Five years after starting work on that first flagship mission, NASA should begin developing both a far-infrared mission and an X-ray mission, each costing an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion, the survey recommends.</p>



<p>A far-infrared window into the universe could help astronomers study how water behaves in forming planetary systems, Fortney says. A successor to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-chandra-x-ray-telescope-celebrates-20-years-space">NASA’s 22-year-old Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> could reveal new details of galaxy evolution, supermassive black hole behavior and other energetic phenomena (<em>SN: 7/25/19</em>).</p>



<p>On the ground, astronomers’ highest priorities, according to the decadal survey, are continuing to build two major optical observatories, the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii — though the latter project has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-mauna-kea-opened-astronomy-controversy">faced controversy</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>).</p>



<p>The survey also notes that it is time to replace the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the Very Long Baseline Array of telescope dishes scattered across the United States. The proposed successor to these world-class radio observatories is the Next-Generation Very Large Array, which would be 10 times as sensitive.</p>



<p>Fortney is optimistic that NASA and other federal agencies will make the decadal survey’s top-ranked priorities a reality. “The record has been quite good, in terms of the most prominent recommendations being born out,” he says. “I have really high confidence that these things really will happen.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Video games are perhaps one of the most politicised forms of entertainment media out there. In the decades since they were first created, governments, politicians, health bodies and beyond have voiced concerns that the amount of time some players spend in these virtual worlds could be detrimental to their mental health.</p>



<p>Despite all this concern, there’s been a lack of high-quality research into the effect of video games on player wellbeing. To remedy this situation, Matti Vuorre and colleagues at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with several large game publishers such as Nintendo and Square Enix, conducted an ambitious longitudinal study. These fears, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8cxyh">they conclude in their recent preprint</a> on <em>PsyArXiv</em>, are unfounded.</p>



<span id="more-44390"></span>



<p>In order to investigate whether longer play times had an impact on player wellbeing, the team recruited a massive 38,935 players of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Apex Legends, Eve Online, Forza, Gran Turismo, Outriders</em>, and <em>The Crew 2</em>. Recruitment emails for this study targeted specifically English-speaking players from several countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of six weeks, players were asked to answer three &#8220;waves&#8221; of a survey, sent two weeks apart, containing measures of wellbeing and motivation. The first measure of wellbeing, a 13-point scale of positive and negative experiences (SPANE), asked participants how they had been feeling in the previous two weeks, and to rate how often they had experienced six positive and six negative feelings. The Cantril self-anchoring scale, in which participants rate their level of life satisfaction between 0 to 10, was also used to assess wellbeing.</p>



<p>Players were also asked to reflect on their experiences playing the game over the past two weeks, by filling in the player experience and need satisfaction scale (PENS), which included questions on feelings of autonomy, competence, relatedness (for example, with other players), as well as motivation. Finally, participants were asked to give an estimate of the time they’d spent playing the video game they were recruited through for the previous two weeks (the games’ publishers also provided the research team with each participant’s actual total playtimes for these two weeks).</p>



<p>Analyses looked at the relationship between hours played in one wave and wellbeing scores in the subsequent wave. Sifting through the data like this revealed that time spent playing these games had little to no apparent causal effect on wellbeing or life satisfaction. The effect was so small, the authors say, that if players went from their minimum play time to their maximum play time, their wellbeing scores would only shift by around 0.013 points on the SPANE scale. The impact on life satisfaction scores would be similarly tiny, shifting by just 0.02 points. These kinds of numbers are not indicative of any meaningful impact on wellbeing.</p>



<p>Switching these two factors around to look at the effect of feelings and life satisfaction on play time, the team found that a one-point increase on the SPANE scale of wellbeing would lead to a 0.01 hour per week increase in play time. Similarly, life satisfaction had essentially no impact on duration of play, suggesting that there is no causal relationship between wellbeing and time spent gaming.</p>



<p>In contrast, however, motivation to game was causally linked to wellbeing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when players wanted to engage with video games, they got a subsequent boost in feelings of wellbeing, whereas when they felt like they were playing through compulsion, those feelings dropped.</p>



<p>The span of game genres used in this study is rather wide — <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, for example, is a pastoral experience, which differs significantly from the high commitment, often high-pressure experience of <em>Eve Online</em>. Even so, there are many other genres which also merit investigation. Time spent playing mobile games, as well as those with microtransactions or addictive elements, may have different impacts on player wellbeing.</p>



<p>Sampling in this study, the authors say, may also have somewhat limited the validity of this result. Because participants were recruited through self-selection, people with particular traits or dispositions that made them more likely to be unaffected by lengthy gaming sessions may have been more likely to provide data. The age of participants — on average, 34 years old — may also limit the generalisability of these findings. It’s possible that as adults, these gamers have developed gaming habits that specifically do not affect their wellbeing, which may not be the case for younger players. And of course, these players were all English speakers, so it remains unclear whether there may be cultural differences in the strength of the relationship between gaming and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Despite these limitations, the results of this study stand as much needed preliminary evidence that time spent playing video games is not a threat to wellbeing. In the future, similarly robust research to confirm these findings in other age groups, as well as investigating the impact of specific gameplay features, will help push this research area forward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-child-skull-hominid-cave-discovery">A child’s partial skull adds to the mystery of how Homo naledi treated the dead</a></h4>

              
                <p>A child’s partial skull found in a remote section of a South African cave system has fueled suspicion that an ancient hominid known as <em>Homo naledi</em> deliberately disposed of its dead in caves.</p>



<p>An international team led by paleoanthropologist Lee Berger of University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg pieced together 28 skull fragments and six teeth from a child’s skull discovered in a narrow opening located about 12 meters from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-new-species-human-genus">an underground chamber where cave explorers first found <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/15</em>). Features of the child’s skull qualify it as <em>H. naledi</em>, a species with an orange-sized brain and skeletal characteristics of both present-day people and <em>Homo</em> species from around 2 million years ago.</p>



<p>“The case is building for deliberate, ritualized body disposal in caves by <em>Homo naledi</em>,” Berger said at a November 4 news conference held in Johannesburg. While <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pieces-homo-naledi-story-continue-puzzle">that argument is controversial</a>, there is no evidence that the child’s skull was washed into the tiny space or dragged there by predators or scavengers (<em>SN: 4/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Berger’s group describes the find in two papers published November 4 in <em>PaleoAnthropology. </em>In one, Juliet Brophy, a paleoanthropologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and colleagues <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/64">describe the youngster&#8217;s skull</a>. In the other, paleoanthropologist Marina Elliott of Canada’s Simon Fraser University in Burnaby and colleagues detail <a href="https://paleoanthropology.org/ojs/index.php/paleo/article/view/68">new explorations in South Africa’s Rising Star cave system</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers nicknamed the new find Leti, short for a word in a local South African language that means “the lost one.” Leti likely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans">dates to the same time as other <em>H. naledi</em> fossils</a>, between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>). Berger’s team suspects Leti died at about age 4 to 6 years based on the rate at which children grow today. But that’s a rough approximation as the scientists can’t yet say how fast <em>H. naledi</em> kids grew.</p>

<html><body><p>PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, November 4.</p>



<p>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that it is the first wholly Open Access (OA) publisher to deliver Release 5 COUNTER-compliant usage reporting to the library community. This is an important milestone in the development of usage reporting that meets the growing needs of the OA movement.</p>



<p>PLOS and LibLynx announced a partnership in 2020 to develop ground-breaking analytics that communicate the usage and impact of OA content to their stakeholder communities, and libraries in particular.&nbsp; The first phase of this initiative was to deliver COUNTER reports <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">to PLOS institutional partners</a> that enable them to understand their usage of PLOS OA content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a huge milestone for us. The development of next generation metrics for wholly-OA content is one of great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions, and we are delivering on that promise,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS.</p>



<p>&ldquo;COUNTER very much welcomes PLOS becoming a publisher compliant with the Code of Practice. Our consultations with the library community, our OA Advisory Group and ongoing workshops demonstrate a demand for COUNTER reports from fully OA publishers, as part of the evaluation of the return on investment associated with open access content,&rdquo; said Lorraine Estelle, Project Director, COUNTER.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We needed to develop custom processing logic that attributed OA usage to organizations based on their registered IP addresses in order to generate COUNTER reports for PLOS&rsquo; library community,&rdquo; said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having engaged with the community over the last year to better understand their reporting needs, PLOS and LibLynx are now working on the development of new, more flexible reporting tools to better understand usage and impact of OA content.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baleen-whales-eat-poop-more-food-ecosystem">Baleen whales eat (and poop) a lot more than we realized</a></h4>

              
                <p>Whalers have plucked giant whales from the sea for much of the last century, reducing their numbers by up to 99 percent for certain species. Some scientists thought that krill — the tiny crustaceans that many whales eat in gargantuan gulps — would explode in number as a result, mostly free from the feeding pressure of the largest animals that have ever lived.</p>



<p>But that didn’t happen. Instead, Antarctic krill numbers have dwindled since the mid-20th century, by more than 80 percent in areas heavily trafficked by whalers. Many other consumers of krill, like seabirds and fish, have suffered too in the absence of the crustaceans and their giant eaters.</p>



<p>Now, scientists have a clearer idea why this happened: whale poop, or rather, the lack of it.</p>



<p>A new study finds that baleen whales, including blue and humpback whales, eat on average <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03991-5">three times as much krill</a> and other food as previously thought, and more food in means more poop out. Paradoxically, the collapse of the krill may stem from fewer whales excreting iron-rich, digested krill, denying these ecosystems some crucial nutrients they need to thrive. Phytoplankton blooms, which sustain krill and many other parts of the food web, rely on that iron. Restoring whale populations to prewhaling levels could help bolster these ecosystems and even store more carbon in the ocean, researchers report in the Nov. 4 <em>Nature.</em></p>





<p>“It’s hard to know what role whales play in ecosystems without knowing how much they’re eating,” says Joe Roman, a marine ecologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington who wasn’t involved in the research. Whale food intake was coarsely understood before, he says, and this study will “allow us to better understand how the widespread depletion of whales has impacted ocean ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Assessing the precise diet of Boeing 737–sized creatures that gulp down hordes of centimeter-long invertebrates far below the surface of the ocean is not a trivial undertaking. Previous estimates relied on dissections of dead whales or inferring whales’ metabolic needs based on their size. “These studies were educated guesses, and none were conducted on live whales in the wild,” says Matthew Savoca, a marine biologist at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, Calif.</p>



<p>But new technology gave Savoca and colleagues “a chance to answer a really basic biological question about some of the most charismatic animals on earth.”</p>



<p>The researchers needed to know three things: how often whales feed, how big of gulps they take and how much food is in each gulp. Using sophisticated sensors suction-cupped to the backs of 321 individuals of seven whale species, the researchers could tell when the whales lunged for prey, a reliable sign of feeding. Aerial drones snapped photos of 105 whales, which the researchers used to estimate gulp size. Finally, sonar mapping revealed the density of krill in key feeding areas.</p>

<p>Combining these datasets together revealed a more detailed look at feeding than ever before, says Sarah Fortune, a marine ecologist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Winnipeg. Savoca and his colleagues “measured all the things you need to measure to get an accurate estimate of consumption,” for baleen whales, she says.</p>



<p>It turns out that, on average, baleen whales eat about three times as much food as earlier estimates suggested. For example, a blue whale can put down 16 metric tons of krill in a day, the researchers found. Energetically, that’s equivalent to around 10 million to 20 million calories, or about 30,000 Big Macs, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whales aren’t eating that much every day. The animals go for months without a bite when migrating vast distances. But the sheer volume of food that they consume, and then excrete, suggests that whales shape ocean ecosystems to a larger degree than previously thought, Savoca says, making their loss that much more impactful.</p>



<p>That’s because one role whales play is that of nutrient cycler. By feeding on iron-rich krill in the deep and returning some of that iron to the surface in the form of poop, whales help keep this crucial element in the food web. Excessive whaling might have broken this iron cycle. With less iron at the surface, phytoplankton blooms shrink, krill numbers crash and the ecosystem becomes less productive, Savoca says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before industrial whaling <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-us-commercial-whaling-was-coming-to-an-end">killed millions of whales</a> in the 20th century, the researchers estimate that baleen whales in just the Southern Ocean alone, a key feeding area, consumed 430 million metric tons of krill each year, more than twice the biomass of all krill that’s found in those waters today (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>).&nbsp;Even with today’s diminished populations, researchers estimate that whales prevent approximately 1,200 metric tons of iron from being lost each year, left to drift down to the dark deep of the Southern Ocean.</p>



<p>Whales are likely not the only factor behind the staggering loss of krill, Savoca says, but the evidence suggests that “whales play a role here, and when you wholesale remove them, the system becomes, on average, less productive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">Some whale populations are rebounding</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>). If whales and krill could be brought back to their early 1900s numbers, the productivity of the Southern Ocean could be boosted by 11 percent, the researchers calculate. That increased productivity would translate into more carbon-rich bodies, from krill to blue whales, which together would store 215 million metric tons of carbon annually, the equivalent of taking more than <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">170 million cars</a> off the road for a year, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“Whales are not the solution to climate change,” Savoca says. “But rebuilding whale populations would help a sliver, and we need lots of slivers put together to solve the problem.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gold-heavy-elements-cosmos">Neutron star collisions probably make more gold than other cosmic smashups</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cosmic origins of elements heavier than iron are mysterious. One elemental birthplace came to light in 2017 when two neutron-rich dead stars collided and spewed out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">gold, platinum and other</a> hefty elements (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). A few years later, a smashup of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">another neutron star</a> and a black hole left scientists wondering which type of cosmic clash was the more prolific element foundry (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Now, they have an answer. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac26c6">Collisions of two neutron stars</a> probably take the cake, scientists report October 25 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>To create heavy elements after either type of collision, neutron star material must be flung into space, where a series of nuclear reactions called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dwarf-galaxy-was-heavy-element-factory">r-process</a> can transform the material (<em>SN: 4/22/16</em>).</p>



<p>How much material escapes into space, if any, depends on various factors. For example, in collisions of a neutron star and black hole, the black hole has to be relatively small, or “there’s no hope at all,” says astrophysicist Hsin-Yu Chen of MIT. “It’s going to swallow the neutron star right away,” without ejecting anything.</p>



<p>Questions remain about both types of collisions, spotted via the ripples in spacetime that they kick up. So Chen and colleagues considered a range of possibilities for the properties of neutron stars and black holes, such as the distributions of their masses and how fast they spin. The team then calculated the mass ejected by each type of collision under those varied conditions. In most scenarios, the neutron star–black hole mergers made a smaller quantity of heavy elements than the neutron star duos — in one case only about a hundredth the amount.</p>



<p>Still, the ultimate element factory ranking remains up in the air. The scientists compared just these two types of collisions, not other possible sources of heavy elements such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-explosion-hypernova-supernova-universe-heavy-elements-origin">exploding stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Self-control — or lack of it — can have a serious impact on our lives. Poor self-control can lead to feelings of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/02/poor-self-control-can-lead-to-feelings-of-loneliness/">loneliness</a>, while those with higher levels of self-discipline <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/06/people-with-strong-self-control-experience-less-intense-bodily-states-like-hunger-and-fatigue/">experience</a> states like hunger and tiredness less intensely. Yet despite these obvious benefits, the vast majority of us sometimes experience failures in self-control no matter how hard we try.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/35/e2018726118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, looks to quantify the cost of self-control. Candace M. Raio and Paul W. Glimcher from the New York University School of Medicine find that we’re willing to pay a monetary price to avoid having to exert self-control — and we’ll pay more if the temptation is particularly strong.</p>



<span id="more-44298"></span>



<p>In the first study, conducted in a lab, dieting participants started by indicating how healthy, tasty and tempting they found particular foods like crisps or chocolate brownies. They then reported how much of a $10 endowment they would be willing to pay to avoid having the highly tempting food placed immediately in front of them for half an hour. The tempting food was then placed in front of them, and the participant was given further opportunities to bid to have it replaced with a less tempting food.</p>



<p>Importantly, there was a small chance that each bid would go to auction, where it was compared against a random figure between $0 and $10: if the participants bid a higher amount, they would  have a low-tempting food placed in front of them for the remainder of the 30 minutes, but if they bid a lower amount, the highly tempting food would remain for the rest of the time.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants were prepared to pay on average 15% of the $10 to remove the temptation — and continued to bid a similar amount throughout the task, suggesting a sustained desire to have temptation removed. In total, 22% of participants consumed the highly tempting food.</p>



<p>The second study replicated the first — only this time, participants were told they would also lose a $15 bonus if they ate the tempting food. Again, the dieting participants showed a sustained willingness to pay to avoid temptation, bidding on average $2.85 out of their $10 endowment to have the food removed. Thus, they spent more money when the costs of not meeting their self-control goals were higher. Interestingly, with this penalty in place none of the participants presented with the highly tempting food consumed it.</p>



<p>In a third study, some participants were exposed to stress before the self-control task through the immersion of their hand into ice-cold water. These stressed participants were willing to pay more to avoid the tempting food compared to non-stressed participants, more than doubling the amount of money they put up. And in a final study, the team found that participants were willing to pay more to avoid highly tempting food versus food that was only a little tempting.</p>



<p>So, overall, dieting participants were willing to pay actual money in order to avoid exercising self-control in the face of temptation. This reinforces previous research that suggests that when faced with temptation we will attempt to avoid using cognitive resources like self-control as much as we possibly can, relying on different tactics instead. The results also suggest that we carefully weigh up the costs of exercising self-control and the costs of losing self-control, making active and rational decisions about when to give into temptation and what to sacrifice when doing so.</p>



<p>The study also offers interesting insights into &#8220;precommitment&#8221; — rather than being forced to face temptation and succeed, participants preferred to not be exposed to the risk of failure at all. This could be a useful strategy when trying to achieve goals (and is probably already well known to many dieters who remove snacks from their house rather than trying not to eat them).</p>



<p>Future research could look at what happens when people have to face temptation over an unknown time period: all participants in this particular study knew the maximum amount of time they would have to resist temptation, but something different may have happened if they had not had this information. Looking at non-financial costs people are willing to pay could also be enlightening, going some way to explain why we manage to resist temptation in some cases but not in others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-dark-side-image-atmosphere-ice-frost-charon">Pluto’s dark side reveals clues to its atmosphere and frost cycles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pluto’s dark side has come into dim view, thanks to the light of the dwarf planet’s moon.</p>



<p>When NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mission-pluto-live-coverage">flew past Pluto in 2015</a>, almost all the images of the dwarf planet’s unexpectedly complex surface were of the side illuminated by the sun (<em>SN: 7/15/15</em>). Darkness shrouded the dwarf planet’s other hemisphere. Some of it, like the area near the south pole, hadn’t seen the sun for decades.</p>



<p>Now, mission scientists have finally released a grainy <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac2743">view of the dwarf planet’s dark side</a>. The researchers describe the process to take the photo and what it tells them about how Pluto’s nitrogen cycle affects its atmosphere October 20 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Before New Horizons passed by Pluto, the team suspected the dwarf planet’s largest moon, Charon, might reflect enough light to illuminate the distant world’s surface. So the researchers had the spacecraft turn back toward the sun to take a parting peek at Pluto.</p>

<p>At first, the images just showed a ring of sunlight filtering through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-flows-haze-offer-more-clues-plutos-geology">Pluto’s hazy atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/15</em>). “It’s very hard to see anything in that glare,” says planetary scientist John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “It’s like trying to read a street sign when you’re driving toward the setting sun and you have a dirty windshield.”</p>



<p>Spencer and colleagues took a few steps to make it possible to pull details of Pluto’s dark side out of the glare. First, the team had the spacecraft take 360 short snapshots of the backlit dwarf planet. Each was about 0.4 seconds long, to avoid overexposing the images. The team also took snapshots of the sun without Pluto in the frame so that the sun could be subtracted out after the fact.</p>





<p>Tod Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., tried to process the images when he got the data in 2016. At the time, the rest of the data from New Horizons was still fresh and took up most of his attention, so he didn’t have the time to tackle such a tricky project.</p>



<p>But “it was something that just sat there and ate away at me,” Lauer says. He tried again in 2019. Because the spacecraft was moving as it took the images, each image was a little bit smeared or blurred. Lauer wrote a computer code to remove that blur from each individual frame. Then he added the reflected Charon light in each of those hundreds of images together to produce a single image.</p>





<p>“When Tod did that painstaking analysis, we finally saw something emerging in the dark there … giving us a little bit of a glimpse of what the dark pole of Pluto looks like,” Spencer says.</p>



<p>That the team got anything at all is impressive, says planetary scientist Carly Howett, also of the Southwest Research Institute and who is on the New Horizons team but was not involved in this work. “This dataset is really, really hard to work with,” she says. “Kudos to this team. I wouldn’t have wanted to do this.”</p>



<p>The image, Howett says, can help scientists understand how Pluto’s frigid nitrogen atmosphere varies with its decades-long seasons. Pluto’s atmosphere is controlled by how much nitrogen is in a gas phase in the air and how much is frozen on the surface. The more nitrogen ice that evaporates, the thicker the atmosphere becomes. If too much nitrogen freezes to the ground, the atmosphere could collapse altogether.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2.jpg" alt="image of pluto showing different kinds of ices represented by different colors" class="wp-image-3105398" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110121_LG_pluto-dark_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105398">In this image of Pluto’s sunlit side from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, different colors represent different kinds of ices. A faint glimpse of Pluto’s dark hemisphere in newly released mission images reveals some new details about how those ices behave.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105398">SwRI, JHUAPL, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When New Horizons was there, Pluto’s south pole looked darker than the north pole. That suggests there was not a lot of fresh nitrogen frost freezing out of the atmosphere there, even though it was nearing winter. “The previous summer ended decades ago, but Pluto cools off pretty slowly,” Spencer says. “Maybe it’s still so warm [that] the frost can’t condense there, and that keeps the atmosphere from collapsing.”</p>



<p>There was a bright spot in the middle of the image, which could be a fresh ice deposit. That’s also not surprising, Howett says. The ices may still be moving from the north pole to the south pole as Pluto moves deeper into its wintertime.</p>



<p>“We’ve thought this for a long time. It makes sense,” she says. “But it’s nice to see it happening.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why depth interviewing is essential to understanding individuals and institutions</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/why-depth-interviewing-is-essential-to-understanding-individuals-and-institutions/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/christina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>From scraping &#8220;big data&#8221; from the internet to the analyzing genomic information about individuals and social groups, today’s researchers have a dizzying array of new methods for studying the social world. One consequence of this explosion of options has been to obscure the value of tried-and-true ones. Depth interviewing is a case in point. Once assumed to be a core research tool, many of today’s researchers have cast a skeptical eye on it. While past debates centered around whether we could rely on insights drawn from a limited number of people, new concerns have arisen from those who advocate direct observation, whether in natural or experimental settings. These skeptics express doubt that social researchers can trust the information gleaned from self-reports, pointing especially to the ways that depth interviewing may elicit accounts that are internally inconsistent or that contradict what people actually do. Such doubters argue that since people are prone to express ideas, beliefs, or behaviors that contradict one another, their self-reports are neither credible nor useful.<br><br>These critiques reflect a fundamental misunderstanding about what depth interviews can accomplish and how, when designed and carried out well, they are uniquely suited to gathering crucial insights about the nature of human consciousness and the relationship between thought and action. One-on-one interviewing creates a setting in which the “unobservable” becomes visible. Life history interviews allow people to describe and reflect on how prior experiences have led them to their current circumstances and outlooks, including what key events propelled them to devise life strategies and make consequential life choices. Focusing on the present, depth interviews provide a safe space where people are invited to share their most private experiences, thoughts, and feelings. While it is not be possible to observe a wide range of intimate activities, from sexual encounters to all sorts of dyadic interactions, interviews allow participants to describe and reflect on such events. And whatever the topic, interviews allow people to explore the meanings they attach to their actions and beliefs and to reveal the processes by which their social contexts created experiences that prompted ensuing responses.<br><br>Indeed, a key contribution of depth interviewing lies in its ability to uncover the contradictions that people express. Rather than accepting such accounts at face value, our research (and that of many others) demonstrates that we ignore contradictory thoughts and actions at our peril. Contradictory accounts as well as inconsistencies between “saying” and “doing” are central to human thought and action. Depth interviews provide an opportunity to delve into the nature of such beliefs and behaviors and explore the reasons people hold inconsistent views or act in apparently inconsistent ways. In addition to unearthing the meanings people imbue to their contradictory thinking or behavior, interviews can also discover the social contexts that give rise to them. When people express inconsistent beliefs or reveal conflicts between their values and choices, they alert us to look for the social contexts and cultural formations that create conflicts for which there are no simple or straightforward ways to respond. </p><p>Given the complexity of twenty-first-century life, it has become even more crucial to understand how people navigate the tensions created by conflicting institutional arrangements. In the context of a rapidly changing world, interviews shed light on the interplay between incompatible options and the evolving responses people craft to cope with them. Paying close attention to the different layers of meaning within each interview and carefully analyzing the patterns that emerge across all the interviewees enables depth interviewers to understand how social structures and cultural schemas shape human endeavors and how, in turn, social actors participate in constructing and potentially changing the world they inherit. By eliciting contradictory accounts and using them to delve into why people hold inconsistent beliefs or act in contradictory ways, depth interviews illuminate complex social patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>Whether the goal is to chart how structure and action interact as individuals build their life paths, to learn about intimate experiences that cannot be observed, to uncover how people give meaning to their own and others’ practices and beliefs, or to understand how social arrangements prompt people to hold contradictory views and take inconsistent actions, depth interviews are the best, and possibly the only, method for learning about such core social dynamics. When interviewers ask probing questions, listen carefully to their participants’ answers, and analyze their findings with an eye firmly focused on discovering the patterns that emerge from the complex material they gather, interviewing enlightens us about the many dimensions of human experience that cannot be reduced to numbers, biological factors, or observable behavior. As we rightfully seek to expand the social science toolkit, it would be ironic if we lose sight of a method that offers unique access to the hidden dimensions of personal and social life. Instead, we must renew our commitment to a research technique that places human consciousness at the forefront.</p><p><em><sup>Featured image by </sup></em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/eF7HN40WbAQ"><sup><em>Christina@wocintechchat.com</em></sup></a><em><sup> via Unsplash</sup></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/672104152/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/672104152/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f11%2fchristina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/672104152/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/i-wouldnt-start-from-here-a-shape-route-to-open-access/">&#8220;I wouldn&#x2019;t start from here&#8221;: a SHAPE route to open access</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/sustainability-in-action-dismantling-systems-to-combat-climate-change/">Sustainability in action: dismantling systems to combat climate change</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/how-oup-is-innovating-for-the-future-of-open-research/">How OUP is innovating for the future of open research</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Brain
Network Dynamics during Working Memory Are Modulated by Dopamine and Diminished
in Schizophrenia&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible
working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood.
Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide
switching between activity states using a combination of functional
magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with
schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network
control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1
receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2
receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with
schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a
more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics
during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia
pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">A rush to watch a supernova exposed its last gasp before exploding</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mad scramble to observe the moments after a star’s death is helping scientists understand how the star lived out its last year.</p>



<p>Astronomers reported the exploding star just 18 hours after it flared up on March 31, 2020, in a galaxy about 60 million light-years away from Earth in the Virgo cluster. The supernova occurred in part of the sky already watched by NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/less-year-after-launch-tess-already-finding-bizarre-worlds">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>, which images large portions of the sky every 30 minutes (<em>SN: 1/8/19</em>). And a team of scientists quickly realized that data would track precisely how the eruption brightened over time, making it ideal for further study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn even more, the team leapt into action, viewing the supernova with a variety of telescopes in the hours and days that followed, even orchestrating a last-minute change of plans for the Hubble Space Telescope. That provided the supernova’s spectrum, an accounting of its light broken up by wavelength, at various moments after the blast.</p>



<p>All that data revealed that in the last year of its life, the star had <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab2887/6410679?redirectedFrom=fulltext">spewed some of its outer layers into space</a>, researchers report October 26 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The amount of material ejected was about 0.23 times the mass of the sun, the team estimates.&nbsp;When the supernova went off, it launched a shock wave that plowed through that material shortly after the explosion, generating light picked up by the telescopes.</p>



<p>As large stars get closer to death, they may start behaving erratically. Aging stars fuse heavier and heavier elements in their cores. For this star, the switch to fusing oxygen could have triggered that shedding in its last year, astrophysicist Samaporn Tinyanont of the University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues suggest. “These stars have a roller coaster last few years of their life,” Tinyanont says.</p>



<p>Scientists hope that understanding that roller coaster ride could help them recognize when other stars are about to blow.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/02/frenemies-both-help-and-harm-each-other-at-work/">“Frenemies” Both Help And Harm Each Other At Work</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Think about your relationships with your colleagues… I bet there are at least some who you’d call &#8220;frenemies&#8221;. Maybe there’s a co-worker whose sense of humour you love, say — but who also irritates you by failing to pull their weight. In fact, the workplace is the ideal breeding ground for relationships that are characterised by simultaneous, strong positive <em>and</em> negative feelings — so-called &#8220;ambivalent relationships&#8221; (or frenemies) — note the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-88624-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s surprising, then, how little is known about how frenemies behave with each other, write Shimul Melwani at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Naomi Rothman at Lehigh University. So the pair ran a series of studies to find out.</p>



<span id="more-44293"></span>



<p>In the first, groups of 3 -6 students who’d been assigned a joint task were asked 2.5 weeks into the project to rate how positively and/or negatively they felt about each other. About a month later, they all reported on the extent to which they’d received help (support in a discussion, say), or harm (a verbal attack, perhaps), from each other. Unsurprisingly, the students gave more help to team members they liked and enacted more harmful behaviour towards those that they disliked. But the data also showed that frenemies both helped <em>and </em>harmed each other.</p>



<p>In a second study, the researchers used variations of a standard lab technique for developing closeness between two people. While seated in a cubicle by themselves, these participants used instant messaging to communicate with a partner, to share answers to a set of questions. Some followed questions designed to foster a positive relationship — by getting them to discuss their hobbies and interests, for example, and also to share a few things that they liked about their partner. Other pairs followed a &#8220;negative&#8221; question set (this included a final question that asked them to share a few things that they <em>didn’t </em>like about their partner). A third group followed a frenemy set. For example, after answering the question, &#8220;What is one recent accomplishment that you are proud of?&#8221; (a question that can enhance closeness and positive feelings between people), these participants had to compare and evaluate each other’s achievements (encouraging more negative feelings).</p>



<p>Next came what the participants believed was a collaborative task. And there were some interesting findings. Those in the ambivalent condition acted more co-operatively than those in the negative group; they claimed less of a shared reward, for example, and made more helpful contributions to a piece of work that they believed had been completed by their partner. However, they also delivered more harmful feedback about their partner to the experimenter, compared with those in the positive group — but delivered less negative feedback directly to their partner than did those in the negative group.</p>



<p>For their final study, the team turned to actual co-workers: they ran an online study of 166 US-based participants who worked in retail. These people reported on their experiences, emotions and motivations in actual positive, negative and ambivalent relationships with colleagues. For example, they reported on occasions in which they had supported these colleagues, or instigated arguments, acted rudely or started rumours about them.</p>



<p>Echoing the results of the second study, these employees were more likely to &#8220;covertly&#8221; harm frenemies (to spread rumours behind their back say) than people they felt positively about. But they also helped frenemies more than they helped people they didn’t like.</p>



<p>There are implications for workplaces, the researchers conclude. One important one is this: though ambivalent relationships involve high levels of negativity (as well as positivity), “they are much more beneficial compared to negative relationships,” they write. Managers could well struggle to turn negative relationships into positive ones. But if positivity-focused exercises, such as trust-building interactions, could shift relationships characterised by thorough dislike to frenemy status, everyone could benefit. “Even though it is impractical to entirely transform one’s worst relationships into one’s best ones, by infusing some positivity into these relationships, they can become ambivalent, and deliver some benefits at work,” the researchers write.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">Lithium-ion batteries made with recycled materials can outlast newer counterparts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lithium-ion batteries with recycled cathodes can outperform batteries with cathodes made from pristine materials, lasting for thousands of additional charging cycles, a study finds.&nbsp;<br><br>Growing demand for these batteries — which power devices from smartphones to electric vehicles — may outstrip <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">the world’s supply of some crucial ingredients</a>, such as cobalt (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>). Ramping up recycling could help avert a potential shortage. But some manufacturers worry that impurities in recycled materials may cause battery performance to falter.</p>



<p>“Based on our study, recycled materials can perform as well as, or even better than, virgin materials,” says materials scientist Yan Wang of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.</p>



<p>Using shredded spent batteries, Wang and colleagues extracted the electrodes and dissolved the metals from those battery bits in an acidic solution. By tweaking the solution’s pH, the team removed impurities such as iron and copper and recovered over 90 percent of three key metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. The recovered metals formed the basis for the team’s cathode material.</p>



<p>In tests of how well batteries maintain their capacity to store energy after repeated use and recharging, batteries with recycled cathodes outperformed ones made with brand-new commercial materials of the same composition. It took 11,600 charging cycles for the batteries with recycled cathodes to lose 30 percent of their initial capacity. That’s <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00433-5">about 50 percent better than the respectable 7,600 cycles</a> for the batteries with new cathodes, the team reports October 15 in <em>Joule</em>. Those thousands of extra cycles could translate into years of better battery performance, Wang says.</p>

With the greater space available I also took the opportunity to expatiate at considerable length in doing so. This turned into another eBook!</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Please note that what I say in the attached document is built on an interview. It is not intended to be any kind of prediction of the future; it is more an extended reflection after 20 years reporting on the OA movement, coupled with a heavy dose of speculation.

Maybe this will prove my swan song.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">I would also like to stress upfront that in the critique of the OA movement I make I don’t claim that my knowledge, or predictions, are superior to anyone else’s.

It does also include a lot of factual data, as well as links and footnotes for those who like them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Importantly, while I do not consider myself to be an OA advocate, I admit that I was as naïve as anyone else about what the movement might be able to achieve.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finally, while what I say might be slightly overweight in European developments, it may not matter if (as I believe is possible) events in Europe end up determining how open access develops globally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">I say this because it seems possible that European OA initiatives will reconfigure the international scholarly communication system, and in ways that OA advocates will not be comfortable with.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">I would add that the main focus is on science publishing rather than HSS.&nbsp;</span></p><p><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The eBook can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Information_Wants_to_be_Free.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>Today, software is a key part of almost all research, and the development and
maintenance of this software is done by human beings, often in academia. It&#8217;s
essential that these activities be seen as a valued element of scholarly work
so that the people who do it have career paths that encourage them to continue
to do it. One means of accomplishing this is to use the existing scholarly
citation&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group"><span class="caps">FORCE11</span> Software Citation working group</a> developed a
set of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles">Software Citation Principles in 2016</a>, and since then, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group"><span class="caps">FORCE11</span> Software Citation Implementation working group</a>
has been working with many types of stakeholders, including publishers,
repositories, and standards, to implement the principles.  We&#8217;ll talk about
this work, the changes we&#8217;ve seen, what still needs to be done, and how the
<span class="caps">INCF</span> community can&nbsp;participate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-alive-coronavirus-definition">Are viruses alive, not alive or something in between? And why does it matter?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Villain. Killer. Menace. </em>Since 2020, scientists and public officials have used these words to describe SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. News articles, research papers and tweets repeatedly personify the virus as a bad guy intent on killing us.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, we’re intent on killing it, with handwashing, antiseptic wipes, hand sanitizer, bleach, even robots zapping hospital rooms with ultraviolet light. Yet, according to most scientists, we’ve been working hard to kill something that isn’t alive.</p>

<p>Scientists have argued for hundreds of years over how to classify viruses, says <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2705">Luis Villarreal</a>, professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine, where he founded the Center for Virus Research. In the 1700s, viruses were believed to be poisons. In the 1800s, they were called biological particles. By the early 1900s, they’d been demoted to inert chemicals.</p>



<p>Throughout, viruses have rarely been considered alive. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/073911011010524992">More than 120 definitions</a> of life exist today, and most require metabolism, a set of chemical reactions that produce energy. Viruses do not metabolize. They also don’t fit some other common criteria. They do not have cells. They cannot reproduce independently. Viruses are inert packages of DNA or RNA that cannot replicate without a host cell. A coronavirus, for example, is a nanoscale sphere made up of genes wrapped in a fatty coat and bedecked in spike proteins.</p>



<p>Still, viruses have many traits of living things. They are made of the same building blocks. They replicate and evolve. Once inside a cell, viruses engineer their environment to suit their needs — constructing organelles and dictating which genes and proteins the cell makes. Recently discovered giant viruses — which rival the size of some bacteria — have been found to contain genes for proteins used in metabolism, raising the possibility that some viruses might metabolize.</p>





<p>Plus, almost every rule that excludes viruses from the land of the living has its own exceptions. For example, <em>Rickettsia</em> bacteria are classified as living but, like viruses, can multiply only within other cells. All living things, in fact, rely on other living things. A single rabbit cannot replicate on its own, but a rabbit is definitely alive, right?</p>



<p>For these reasons and others, the debate over whether viruses are alive or not continues today. In 2004, virologists Marc H.V. Van Regenmortel of the University of Strasbourg in France and Brian Mahy, then at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, defined viruses as “nonliving infectious entities that can be said, at best, to lead a kind of borrowed life.”</p>



<p>Or maybe a virus can be both nonliving <em>and</em> alive. In 2011, biologist Patrick Forterre of the Pasteur Institute in Paris argued that viruses alternate between an inactive state (outside a cell) and a living, metabolically active state (inside a cell) that he calls the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631074810001724?via%3Dihub">virocell</a>.</p>



<p>For Forterre, viruses are like seeds or spores. They have the potential for action and that potential can be extinguished. That, at least, jibes with our experience of investing endless time and money trying to kill HIV, Zika, SARS-CoV-2 and many more.</p>

Abrahão <em>et al/Nature Communications</em> 2018</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While debates over classification can at times feel frivolous, in reality how we talk about viruses affects how they are researched, treated and eradicated.</p>



<p>Personifying viruses as villains and menaces interferes with a real understanding of evolution and nature, says <a href="https://apc.ucc.ie/colin_hill/">Colin Hill</a>, an infectious disease specialist at University College Cork in Ireland. The most successful viruses are persistent and benign; they remain dormant in cells or reproduce slowly, so as to not damage a cell’s replication machinery. “Viruses and their prey are not fighting, they’re dancing,” says Hill. Yet that’s rarely how we perceive them.</p>



<p>What’s more, since viruses are frequently classified as nonliving, many types of viral infection — especially when viruses successfully colonize a host in a persistent, lifelong manner without causing acute illness — are ignored as “backwater” science, says Villarreal. “Think of it like having dirt on your shoe,” he says. Like that dirt, some scientists consider persistent viral infections as simply a nuisance and therefore not urgent to study. For example, a DNA virus called polyomavirus is commonly used in laboratories to study how viruses cause cancer. Yet because the virus’s rhesus macaque hosts seldom, if ever, get tumors from it, little is known about how and why polyomavirus persists in an animal population.</p>



<p>But understanding such infections is hugely important to humankind. “A persistent virus in one host is frequently quite nasty in another host, and that’s what we’re experiencing with COVID,” says Villarreal.</p>



<p>Viruses have been disregarded in other ways, too. Consider the tree of life, a model and research tool used to depict evolution through time. Viruses are routinely left off, including in popular versions such as the <a href="https://itol.embl.de/">Interactive Tree of Life</a>. Without viruses, one cannot fully understand the mechanisms of evolution, says Hill.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Viruses and their prey are not fighting, they’re dancing.”</p><cite>Infectious disease specialist Colin Hill</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Viruses are <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/factors-allow-viruses-infect-humans-coronavirus">wildly abundant</a>. They infect all cellular life, from single-celled bacteria to elephants, and they are especially dense in the ocean, where they work as a gigantic recycling network, ripping apart 20 percent of the bacteria and other microbes there each day to release tons of carbon, which is then used by other microorganisms to grow.</p>



<p>Across the globe, viruses don’t just infect cells, they leave behind genetic material. Viral DNA is transmitted not only from one viral particle to its progeny, but also to other viruses and other species. Because of this, viral genetic sequences have permanently taken up residence in the genomes of all organisms, including ours, and we rely on them. Viral DNA is required for the formation of the mammalian placenta; it is crucial in the growth of early embryos; and the human innate immune system is made up, in part, of ancient viral proteins. When a person is fighting COVID-19, they are doing it with the help of viruses that colonized our cells long ago.</p>



<p>In fact, some scientists consider viruses to be the world’s leading source of genetic innovation. Viruses are not a missing branch of the tree of life; they are woven into every limb and leaf.</p>



<p>Scientists may always dispute whether viruses are alive or not, but they can hopefully agree on the importance of viruses to life as we know it. “However you want to think about life,” says Villarreal, “viruses are going to be there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gecko-tail-regrow-regeneration-gene-editing-stem-cells">Gene-edited stem cells help geckos regrow more perfect tails</a></h4>

              
                <p>Regenerating body parts is never easy. For instance, some lizards can grow back their tails, but these new appendages are pale imitations of the original. Now, genetically modified stem cells are helping geckos grow back better tails. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tweaking and implanting embryonic stem cells on the tail stumps of mourning geckos (<em>Lepidodactylus lugubris</em>) allowed the reptiles to grow <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26321-9">tails that are more like the original than ever before</a>, researchers report October 14 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These findings are a stepping-stone to developing regenerative therapies in humans that may one day treat hard-to-heal wounds.</p>



<p>A gecko’s tail&nbsp;is an extension of its spine — with the vertebrae to prove it. Regenerated tails, however, are simpler affairs. “It’s just a bunch of concentric tubes of fat, muscle and skin,” says Thomas Lozito, a biologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>That’s because stem cells in adult geckos produce a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-salamanders-can-regrow-tails-lizards-cant">molecular signal that encourages the formation of cartilage in new tails</a>, but not bone or nervous tissues (<em>SN: 8/17/18</em>). Lozito and his colleagues used embryonic stem cells, which can develop into a wider range of tissues than adult stem cells, modified them to ignore this signal and then implanted them on the tail stumps of geckos that had their tails surgically removed. The tails that grew from these modified stem cells had bonelike grooves in the cartilage and generated new neural tissue at the top of the tail.</p>



<p>These modified tails still lack a spinal cord, making them a far cry from the original. “We fixed one problem, but there are still many imperfections,” Lozito says. “We’re still on the hunt for the perfect tail.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conversations about race can be seriously beneficial to children. Research has highlighted multiple positive <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12622">outcomes</a> for young people of all backgrounds — enhanced ability to accept different viewpoints and perspectives, increased levels of empathy, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-017-0766-5">better understanding of their own identity</a>, and less racial bias to name but a few. Yet some parents are still unwilling to take the time to have such conversations.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/38/e2106366118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, finds that readiness to have such conversations has a lot to do with the racial identity of parents themselves. Looking at family conversations in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Stanford University team finds that even in the context of the global conversation that followed the racially charged killing, White parents were far less willing to have conversations about race than their Black peers.</p>



<span id="more-44287"></span>



<p>Participants, who were either Black or White parents of children aged 0-18 living in the United States, were initially recruited in April 2020, six weeks before Floyd’s murder. First, participants indicated whether or not they have conversations with their children about race, racial inequality and racial identity, as well as how often those conversations were instigated. They were also asked to share a recent conversation they had had with their child, and rated how worried they were that their child might be a target of racial bias or might be racially biased towards others. Another set of parents also completed these measures two months later, in June 2020.</p>



<p>The results showed that, overall, a higher proportion of Black parents discussed race, racial inequality and racial identity than White parents. After the murder of George Floyd Black parents became more likely to discuss inequality, but White parents did not. There were also striking differences when it came to conversations about identity: Black parents remained just as likely to discuss being Black with their children after the murder of Floyd — but White parents were actually <em>less</em> likely to discuss being White.      </p>



<p>Among just those parents who discussed these topics, Black parents increased the frequency they spoke about them with their children after the murder, while White parents maintained the same frequency as before.</p>



<p>The next focus of analysis was the content of parents’ conversations, shared through open-ended answers. White parents were more likely to give their children colour-blind messages — one White parent, for example, reported telling their child that “the colour of your skin doesn’t matter”. But Black parents had far more realistic conversations with their children, preparing them to experience racial bias, police targeting, and injustice. Interestingly, White parents were also more likely to share colour-blind sentiments after Floyd’s murder.</p>



<p>Black parents were also more worried that their children would not only be <em>targets</em> of racial bias but actually biased themselves — but White parents had a low level of worry on both counts, and this remained low even after Floyd&#8217;s murder, perhaps suggesting a further resistance to engaging with questions of race.</p>



<p>So, overall, Black parents were both more willing to engage in questions of race than White parents and more willing to explore issues of injustice after a particularly traumatic event. White parents were also more likely to engage in conversations about race not mattering: colour-blindness, while potentially well-meaning, is ultimately unproductive as it reduces people’s willingness and ability to identify and engage with racial inequality. In the US, where the study took place, race certainly does matter.</p>



<p>The authors of the study note that part of White parents’ reluctance to talk about race could be down to simply not knowing how to address the subject, and suggest that work could be done on the effectiveness of different strategies. Future research could also look at <em>why</em> White parents are so unwilling to have such conversations. Do they feel uncomfortable and out of their depth? Do they (wrongly) think children are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/22/adults-put-off-crucial-conversations-about-race-because-they-mistakenly-think-young-children-wont-understand/">too young to understand</a>? Or is it that they simply don’t care? As the team puts it: “given the reality and brutality of racism and racial inequality, the time to answer these questions, and to have these conversations, is now.”</p>

A special instance of reverse inter-metamorphosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_lycanthropy" target="_blank">clinical lycanthropy</a>, the delusion that one has been transformed into a wolf (or another animal). A recent review identified 43 cases in the literature between 1852 and today (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.718101/full" target="_blank">Guessoum et al., 2021</a>).

The patient was a 28-year-old single male who started grinning, barking, and walking on four legs after being bitten by a dog... but not until two years later (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02537176211047132" target="_blank">Jain et al., 2021</a>). <br /></p><p></p><blockquote>He was apparently alright until two months before the presentation, when, due to the COVID-19-related nationwide lockdown, he read excessively on the internet about dog bites. ... he developed a feeling that his tongue is moving like a dog’s and began having repetitive thoughts about converting into a dog. Gradually, his sleep reduced to 1–2 hours/day, and he expressed fear that if he sleeps, he might get up as a dog. He sought repeated reassurance from his family that he hasn’t transformed into a dog, to the extent that they got irritated and asked him to see a doctor. These repetitive thoughts would be present for the whole day, and he would chant God's name to get relief from them. </blockquote><p></p><p><br /><span></span></p><p>The man had no history of rabies, mood disorder, or substance use. Upon examination, he was anxious but did not present with depression or psychotic features. Instead, he had repetitive doubts about turning into a dog. The patient was diagnosed with moderate OCD (with poor insight) and given a prescription of 20 mg fluoxetine (Prozac). A month later, he reported improvement in his repetitive thoughts, and at three months showed an improvement in social and occupational function. He realized he had spent way too much time on the internet reading and watching videos about dog bites.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; <br /><span></span></p><p></p><p><b>Botanical Inter-metamorphosis</b> <br /></p>A unique arboreal delusion was briefly described in a recent abstract (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/xylological-variant-of-reverse-fregoli-syndrome-delusions-of-being-a-tree/89B04E3D281484E02E9FBC7FB8FE6580" target="_blank">Bakhshi &amp; Hirsch, 2021</a>): a depressed young woman believed she had been transformed into a tree. The major manifestations were standing still for long periods of time and repeating, "I am a tree." <br /><p></p><blockquote>A 21-year-old right-handed cisgender female, two months prior to presentation, noted stiffness and difficulty with ambulation. One-month prior to admission, she experienced recurrent depression with myriad vegetative and nonvegetative symptoms of depression. On admission her chief complaint was "I am a tree", standing motionless and minimally responding to query. After treatment with quetiapine, mirtazapine and hydroxyzine for a one-week period, her perception of being a tree fully resolved.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The authors considered a range of delusional diagnoses for her condition:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><u>Cotard’s syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> think she was dead <br /></li><li><u>Ekbom syndrome</u> (delusional parasitosis) – NO, she did <i>not</i> think her body was infested with bugs</li><li><u>Reverse Inanimate Capgras Syndrome</u> – MAYBE? (but "instead of an imposter replacing a close friend, who then is inserted into the sufferer; a tree has replaced the sufferer.")</li><li><u>Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, misindentification of another, <i>not</i> self</li><li><u>Botanical Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, another person transformed into a plant, <i>not </i>self <br /></li><li><u>Reverse Intermetamorphosis</u> – MAYBE? ("However, in this situation, the objects are all human or animate animals not botanicals.")  – <i>but isn't this the point, to report on a botanical?</i> <br /></li><li><u>Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, altered physical identity of another, <i>not </i>self<br /></li><li><u>Reverse Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, patient assumes the physical identity of another person, <i>not</i> a plant </li><li><u>Botanical Variant of Interparietal Syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> have parietal lobe damage. ("In this condition, parts of the body are perceived to be lifeless, due to lesions of the inferior parietal lobe...")</li></ul><p><br />The groundbreaking conclusion was that doctors should check for delusions involving plant life in all of these syndromes, because botanical variants have not been described before.</p><p>&nbsp;<br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/werewolves-of-london-ontario.html">Werewolves of London, Ontario</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/10/haunting-delusions-of-identity.html">Haunting Delusions of Identity</a><br /><br />  <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/ophidianthropy-delusion-of-being.html">Ophidianthropy: The Delusion of Being Transformed into a Snake</a> <br /><br /> <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/psychopharmacology-of-lycanthropy.html">Psychopharmacology of Lycanthropy</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/10/oldest-remaining-werewolf-movie.html">The oldest remaining werewolf movie&nbsp;</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/s268/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="160" data-original-width="268" height="191" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h191/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" width="320" /></a></div><p></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: arial;">Keanu Reeves as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/comments/9ff679/probably_keanus_least_known_but_imo_funniest_role/" target="_blank">Ortiz the Dog Boy</a> in <i>Freaked</i></span></b></div><p><br /><br /><b>References</b> <br /><br />Bakhshi HS, Hirsch AR.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-kids-5-11-pfizer-parents-questions">What parents need to know about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11</a></h4>

              
                <p>Five to 11-year-olds are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommended Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine for use in children ages 5 to 11 on November 2. The vote was unanimously in favor of offering the vaccine to this group, after committee members agreed that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. CDC director Rochelle Walensky gave the final OK hours later.</p>



<p>“We know millions of parents are eager to get their children vaccinated and with this decision, we now have recommended that about 28 million children receive a COVID-19 vaccine,” Walensky said in a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102-PediatricCOVID-19Vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> announcing the decision. “As a mom, I encourage parents with questions to talk to their pediatrician, school nurse or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before ACIP’s vote, committee member and pediatrician Sarah Long of Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia said she “couldn’t be more supportive” of recommending the use of the vaccine for 5- to 11-year olds. “We have one more vaccine that saves the lives of children,” she said.</p>





<p>Representatives for pediatric medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, also spoke before the vote in support of giving this age group access to the COVID-19 vaccine. “I have seen the devastating effects of COVID-19 infection,” said Pamela Rockwell, who practices family medicine in Ann Arbor, Mich., on behalf of the latter group. The vaccine will offer protection from the “very real and significant harms of COVID-19.”</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration officially issued an emergency use authorization for the vaccine on October 29. That authorization had passed its first hurdle October 26 when an FDA advisory panel gave a thumbs-up to make the vaccine available to 5- to 11-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to endorse emergency use authorization of the vaccine followed an extensive discussion among experts on the FDA panel. Many panelists, for instance, expressed concerns about myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis has been an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis">uncommon, but potentially serious, side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines</a>, primarily in male adolescents and young adults <em>(SN: 6/23/21</em>). Other experts emphasized that while children are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than adults, kids aren’t spared from the worst of the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer for vaccine policy at the CDC, the answer is clear. “We don’t want children to be dying of COVID, even if it is far fewer children than adults,” she said. “And we don’t want them in the ICU.”</p>



<p>FDA Advisory Committee member and pediatrician Jay Portnoy said at the meeting that Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., where he works, has been full for the last month or so, and many of the admitted kids have COVID-19. “I’m looking forward to being able to actually do something to prevent that,” he said.</p>

<p></p>



<p>And for children who have spent much of the last two years facing disrupted school and social lives, vaccination is a step toward normalcy. “It’s really to allow kids the freedom to be kids and do all the things comfortably that kids do,” Emmanuel Walter Jr., a pediatrician at Duke University School of Medicine and chief medical officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute said in an October 27 news briefing. Once vaccinated, children can go to school, play sports and “do the normal things kids want to do.”</p>



<p>Vaccinations are key to preventing disease, in adults and kids. Here’s what to know about kids, COVID-19 and the Pfizer vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How has COVID-19 affected 5- to 11-year-olds?</h4>



<p>As of October 28, 171 children <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">in this age group in the United States have died of COVID-19</a>, according to CDC’s COVID data tracker. Looking at the top 10 causes of death for children in 2019, COVID-19 would be eighth on that list, said Fiona Havers, a medical officer with the CDC’s COVID-19 Public Health Response during a presentation at the FDA meeting. More than 8,300 kids ages 5 to 11 have been hospitalized so far, and about a third of those needed intensive care, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inequities that have been seen throughout the pandemic have not spared younger children. Among 5- to 11-year-olds, the hospitalization rate is three times as high for Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native children as it is for white children, Havers said. Advisory committee member and immunologist James Hildreth, who is president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said the primary reason for his yes vote was to make sure that “the children who really need this vaccine, primarily the Black and brown children in this country, get the vaccine.”</p>



<p>The overall rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 for 5- to 11-year-olds roughly matches what was seen for influenza seasons before the pandemic. But that’s with masking, school closures and other public health measures. Without those precautions, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate may be higher than that seen in past flu seasons, Havers said.</p>



<p>More than 5,000 children who were infected with the coronavirus have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which causes severe inflammation throughout the body. Of those reported cases, 39 percent were among children ages 6 to 11, Havers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.15870">can also experience long COVID</a>, in which symptoms such as fatigue, cough, headaches, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and pain in the muscles and joints persist after being sick. These continued symptoms can limit activity and impact mental health and school attendance. Long COVID can occur after mild or severe disease or following MIS-C. It’s still unclear how many children have been affected by long COVID. One estimate, from a survey by the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics, reported that 7 to 8 percent of U.K. children who had gotten COVID-19 still had symptoms more than 12 weeks after being diagnosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COVID-19 has severely disrupted children’s lives beyond its capacity to cause illness. Children have been kept out of school, which has stalled the education of many kids, and for many has meant missing out on regular meals. School closures that happened during just a few months, from August to October of 2021, as the delta variant was surging, affected more than 1 million students in the United States. We don’t yet know the extent of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">educational and emotional toll</a> school closures have taken on children (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>).</p>





<h4>How was the vaccine evaluated?</h4>



<p>In a clinical trial, Pfizer assessed the immune response and the safety of their mRNA vaccine in kids 5 to 11. The trial included about 2,250 children, with two-thirds getting the shot and the other third receiving a placebo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An earlier study had determined that this age group had a good immune response to a smaller dose, two shots of 10 micrograms, compared with the 30-microgram-per-shot dose given to adolescents and adults. Children’s immune systems tend to respond well to vaccines, so to avoid unnecessarily strong symptoms after a shot, such as high fevers or excessive achiness, the goal with the smaller dose is to hit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer">the right sweet spot between a protective immune response and side effects</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/21</em>).</p>



<h4>How well does the vaccine work?</h4>



<p>The data suggest the vaccine works very well for this age group.</p>



<p>Pfizer assessed kids’ immune response to the vaccine by looking at antibody levels. The company compared the response in a group of 5- to 11-year-olds one month after the second shot with antibody levels seen in a group of 16- to 25-year-olds, who were part of the earlier and much larger <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean">clinical trial that studied the vaccine’s efficacy</a> in tens of thousands of adults (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). There was no difference in the immune responses between the different groups, even though the younger children received a smaller dose, the FDA reported in their review of Pfizer’s trial data. Since the immune response was similar between the two groups, the protection against COVID-19 offered by the vaccine for each group should also be similar.</p>



<p>Pfizer also looked at how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases occurred at least a week after the second shot in children who were vaccinated compared with those who received the placebo. Three of 1,450 vaccinated children developed the disease, while 16 of 736 unvaccinated did, which Pfizer reports as an efficacy of 90 percent. None of the children in the trial had severe COVID-19 or MIS-C.</p>

<h4>What are the side effects?</h4>



<p>In the clinical trial, common side effects were redness, swelling and pain at the site of the injection in the arm, as well as headache and fatigue. There were no cases of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-severe-allergic-reactions-extremely-rare-cdc">anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction</a> that was reported, though rarely, when the Pfizer vaccine was first given to adults outside clinical trials (<em>SN: 1/6/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What about heart inflammation called myocarditis?</h4>



<p>No cases of myocarditis occurred in kids ages 5 to 11 in the follow-up period, three months after vaccination. But with the possibility that this rare complication could occur once the vaccine is used in larger numbers, weighing the risk of myocarditis against the benefits of being protected against COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death took up much of the discussion at the FDA’s advisory panel meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tens of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given to 12- to 29-year-olds. Of 877 confirmed myocarditis cases in this group and 829 hospitalized, there have been no deaths. As of October 6, 607 of 789 adolescents and young adults discharged from the hospital are known to have recovered from their symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Myocarditis can also occur with COVID-19. Patients <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm">with the disease had 16 times the risk for myocarditis</a> as patients without the disease, according to a study of U.S. hospital data from March 2020 to January 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA and CDC have several post-vaccine safety surveillance systems in place. “We will continue to actively look for adverse events,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Md., at the advisory meeting. The CDC and the FDA “are incredibly committed and devoted” to catching any safety issues as soon as possible, he said.</p>



<p>When myocarditis occurs in the general population, due to infection or other causes, it tends to happen after puberty. Based on the lower typical rate for younger kids and the lower vaccine dose that this group will receive, “I am not as concerned about myocarditis,” said Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta. Authorizing the vaccine “is a good move forward for COVID prevention and for protecting our kids.”</p>



<h4>How can parents be sure children are getting the correct, smaller dose?</h4>



<p>The vials of Pfizer vaccine intended for those 12 and older have a purple cap and purple lettering on the label.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help make sure that 5- to 11-year-olds get the right vial, the company has changed the color scheme to orange.</p>



<h4>Should 11-year-olds wait until their 12th birthday to get the same dose that adults do?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>“I would not wait,” said Walter, the Duke pediatrician, who was involved in the clinical trial for Pfizer’s vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because even with the lower dose of the vaccine, 11-year-olds developed lots of antibodies. Data presented during the October 26 FDA advisory meeting show that 5- to 11-year-olds had similar antibody levels as older age groups a month after the second dose. “I’m confident they’ll have the same protection” as 12-year-olds, Walter said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How can parents prepare kids to get the vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The shots can have typical side effects like fever or fatigue. So it may be worth telling children that they might feel achy, have a headache or just not feel good overall for the next day or so, Walter said. “That’s to be expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those symptoms are usually pretty mild. But some kids may end up with stronger side effects, such as feeling more fatigued, than others. If your child does end up feeling crummy, Walter said, it’s OK to use pain medication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/29/young-people-around-the-world-report-high-levels-of-climate-anxiety/">Young People Around The World Report High Levels Of Climate Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In the past few years, the effects of climate change have become undeniably apparent. In the last two years alone, headlines have been full of climate disasters — from forest fire smoke turning San Francisco&#8217;s sky luminous red, to torrential flooding in Germany and China.</p>



<p>In the face of events like this, anxiety and fear about climate change is undoubtedly increasing. Far from being indicative of mental illness, climate anxiety (also known as eco-anxiety or climate distress) more neatly fits under the banner of “practical anxiety”: fear that motivates change to help us respond to threats. Even though this in itself is useful, the experiences of fear can be unrelenting, and have serious consequences for mental health and functioning.</p>



<p>Young people are more at risk than those from older generations; an uncertain and dangerous climate situation poses the most risk to their futures, after all.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Caroline Hickman and colleagues at the University of Bath set out to investigate the extent of young people’s feelings and thoughts on climate change, and the functional impact associated with them. In their global study, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955">posted as a preprint at SSRN,</a> they look how the threats of climate change, as well as government response to these threats, affect the emotions and day to day functioning of young people.</p>



<span id="more-44282"></span>



<p>Ten thousand participants aged between 16 and 25 years old were recruited via an online survey portal. These participants were based in ten different countries from around the world, as far flung as Australia, Brazil, India, and Finland. All completed a measure of climate anxiety constructed specifically for this study by 11 experts in relevant areas of psychology and law. Participants were not made aware of the topic of the survey before starting.</p>



<p>The measure itself contained eight broad sections; these related to worry about climate change, its impact on their functioning, emotions and thoughts about climate change, as well as feelings of being ignored on the topic, beliefs about government response to the threat, and the emotional impact of that response. In order to more closely investigate particular constructs, such as negative feelings about climate change or negative thoughts about government response, the team also condensed scores from relevant items across these sections during their analyses. And, last but not least, emotional impacts of government responses were split into two scales — the reassurance scale, and the betrayal scale — to allow closer analysis of positive and negative feelings, respectively.</p>



<p>Across all countries, the majority of participants (60%) reported feeling “very” or “extremely” worried about climate change. More than 45% reported that these feelings negatively impacted their daily lives. By country, those expressing the highest amount of worry tended to be from poorer regions, in the Global South, and those who had been more directly impacted by climate change. For example Portugal, where there have in recent years been extensive wildfires, rated highest for worry amongst its neighbours in the Global North.</p>



<p>Participants reported a wide range of negative emotions: 77% said the future was frightening, and over 50% had felt afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty about climate change. Optimism and indifference, unfortunately, were not often reported. When talking to others about climate change, almost half of participants said their concerns had been ignored or dismissed.</p>



<p>When it came to rating government response, participants were generally unimpressed. Over 60% of respondents disagreed with every positive statement about their government’s climate action, though this did vary significantly between countries. Across all regions, however, feelings of betrayal were higher than those of reassurance.</p>



<p>Correlational analyses indicated close positive relationships between negative thoughts, worry about climate change, and impact on functioning. These factors also correlated strongly with feelings of government betrayal and negative beliefs about their response to the climate threats at hand, suggesting that those who believed the government to be underperforming in their response to climate change experienced more negative psychological consequences. In many, this is likely to constitute Moral Injury – significant psychological distress caused by witnessing a traumatic event that runs against the viewer’s morals, that they are powerless to stop. Not only can Moral Injury further increase mental health risks, the authors say, but it could also open the door to lawsuits based on psychological harm.</p>



<p>The measure used in this study was not standardised, as no suitable measure existed previously, meaning further investigation as to its validity would likely be beneficial. And of course, the data is correlational, meaning that no conclusions about causality can be drawn from this data (no matter how intuitive they may feel).</p>



<p>Even so, taken together, the data collected in study stands as firm evidence that climate anxiety is evident across the globe. This continued stress on the younger members of our populations severely affects their emotions and ability to function day-to-day. Given the timescale of issues at hand, it’s easy to imagine how the rapidly increasing threats of climate change could give rise to mental health issues among many young people, especially if governments continue to fail in their responses. Further research into these climate-specific stressors as precursors to mental health issues in young people will likely illuminate this relationship further.</p>



<p>The authors say that their results also demonstrate the point that climate anxiety isn’t simply caused by ecological catastrophe: it’s also directly related to government inaction. Greater levels of action and commitment by governments can not only enable us to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century, it also has the potential to improve the mental wellbeing of citizens around the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/math-equation-describes-bird-eggs-all-shapes-found-mystery">An elusive equation describing bird eggs of all shapes has been found at last</a></h4>

              
                <p>For years, scientists have tried to crack a mathematical mystery: Is there an equation that can perfectly describe each and every bird egg? Variable shell shapes complicated things. But it turns out the answer is simple. A formula using just four easily measured dimensions can calculate the shape of any avian egg, be it round as a ping-pong ball, a smooshed sphere, oblong or a curvaceous pear, researchers report in an upcoming issue of the <em>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>It was that last shape that had eluded the eggs-perts. They found themselves yoked to an equation that couldn’t accurately describe pyriform, or conical, eggs. Previously, researchers developed an equation that accounted for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flight-demands-may-have-steered-evolution-bird-egg-shape">spherical brown hawk owl eggs</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>), elliptical <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eggs-evolved-color-and-speckles-only-once-during-dinosaur-age">emu eggs</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/18</em>), ovoid osprey eggs and other similarly shaped eggs. &nbsp;But that formula didn’t apply to the pear-shaped eggs from birds like great snipes and King penguins.</p>



<p>The new formula needs four inputs: the egg’s length, its maximum breadth, its diameter at the spot where its pointed end terminates and the location of its maximum diameter in relationship to the midpoint of its length. Adding one additional function and incorporating that last diameter variable to existing egg math led to the universal equation.</p>



<p>The finding could have real-life implications, says Darren Griffin, a geneticist at the University of Kent in England, who did the work along with Kent biologist Michael Romanov and Valeriy Narushin, an agricultural engineer formerly at Kent. For example, being able to calculate an egg’s shape could help designers create better padded or form-fitting egg containers, minimizing grocery store waste or that disappointing moment of arriving home with a carton of eggs, opening the lid and finding your eggs cracked. “We’re all supposed to check in the box” before leaving the store, but it’s easy to forget, says Griffin.</p>







<p>The equation could also come in handy in conservation efforts. When reintroducing a bird species, “one of the considerations would be ‘How likely are the eggs to break?’” Griffin says. Knowing an egg’s math could help researchers calculate what parts are most vulnerable to cracking, which in turn could help them assess where and how best to place them in certain habitats to help grow the population in those areas.</p>



<p>The formula’s simplicity “makes this approach practical for field studies” and could even enable researchers to collect the measurements from digital photographs, says Mark Hauber, an ornithologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “My lab had been working on something like this, but we weren’t able to derive the new math.” His recent <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201615">work</a> has focused on determining “how birds themselves can tell if an object is naturally egg-shaped or an artificial shape that shares some of the geometry with natural eggs.”</p>



<p>The discovery of the egg equation came while the researchers were exploring how to nondestructively assess the sexes of avian embryos before eggs are incubated. They were looking for physical differences between the attributes of eggs containing female and male embryos, Narushin says. The universal formula is an initial step in “resolving such an enigma.” Now they’re working on a new brood of egg problems, searching for a universal formula for computing the volume and surface area of various eggs, as well as exploring “mathematical shell secrets,” such as why shell thickness differs by species. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-nasa-meteor-strikes-mars">What the Perseverance rover’s quiet landing reveals about meteor strikes on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lander was listening. On February 18, NASA’s InSight lander on Mars turned its attention to the landing site for another mission, Perseverance, hoping to detect its arrival on the planet.</p>



<p>But InSight heard nothing.</p>



<p>Tungsten blocks ejected by Perseverance during entry landed hard enough to create craters on the Martian surface. Collisions like these — whether from space missions or meteor strikes — send shock waves through the ground. Yet in the first experiment of its kind on another world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01502-0">InSight failed to pick up any seismic waves from the blocks’ impacts</a>, researchers report October 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>As a result, researchers think that less than 3 percent of the energy from the impacts made its way into the Martian surface. The intensity of impact-generated rumblings varies from planet to planet and is “really important for understanding how the ground will change from a big impact event,” says Ben Fernando, a geophysicist at the University of Oxford.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="266" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline.jpg" alt="photos of crater on Mars" class="wp-image-3105306" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline-330x129.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105306">Perseverance left behind several craters (one indicated with the arrow) after pieces of the mission disengaged as planned during entry, creating a rare opportunity to see how Mars absorbs energy from impacts.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105306">Univ. of Arizona, JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But getting these measurements is tricky. Scientists need sensitive instruments placed relatively near an impact site. Knowing when and where a meteor will strike is nearly impossible, especially on another world.</p>



<p>Enter Perseverance: a hurtling space object set <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">to hit Mars at an exact time and place</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). To help with its entry, Perseverance dropped about 78 kilograms of tungsten as the rover landed about 3,450 kilometers from InSight. The timing and weight of the drop provided a “once-in-a-mission opportunity” to study the immediate seismic effects of an impact from space, Fernando says.</p>



<p>The team had no idea whether InSight would be able to detect the blocks’ impacts or not, but the quiet arrival speaks volumes. “It lets us put an upper limit on how much energy from the tungsten blocks turned into seismic energy,” Fernando says. “We’ve never been able to get that number for Mars before.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/intellectual-humility-science-research-results-psychology">Scientists should report results with intellectual humility. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the children’s chapter book series <em>Zoey and Sassafras</em>, which my own two kids adore, young Zoey has to work out how to save magical creatures with mysterious injuries and ailments. Zoey’s scientist mother teaches her the basics of running an experiment: Observe, hypothesize, test and conclude. Throughout the series, Zoey learns that failed experiments, while disappointing, are simply part of the scientific process.</p>



<p>Schoolteachers similarly encourage most budding scientists to be open to making mistakes and refining ideas — to be like Zoey. In theory, then, this humble thinking should remain foundational as students become established scientists. Yet, in an October 28 commentary in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, psychologists Rink Hoekstra and Simine Vazire argue that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01203-8">the practice of science</a>, particularly the process of publishing findings in scientific journals, is far from this “tell it as it is” style. It’s more arrogant.</p>



<p>“I think implicitly we are taught to brag about our results,” says Hoekstra, of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Hoekstra and Vazire, of the University of Melbourne in Australia, propose scientists should be willing to acknowledge that they might be wrong, what psychologists call “intellectual humility.” This humble approach extends beyond transparency, the authors write. “Owning our limitations … entails a commitment to foregrounding them, taking them seriously, and accepting their consequences.”</p>



<p>Psychologists have shown that intellectual humility helps people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">learn for the sake of learning</a>, has the potential to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300805">reduce political polarization</a> and encourages people to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550620988242">interrogate news stories for misinformation</a>.</p>



<p>A humble approach could also help restore faith in the social sciences. The field has been in a state of crisis for about a decade as researchers have repeatedly tried and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">failed to replicate original research</a>. That ongoing crisis has prompted soul-searching among many scientists. In 2016, personality psychologist Julia Rohrer launched the <a href="https://lossofconfidencecom.wordpress.com/">Loss-of-Confidence Project</a>, which asked researchers to submit work they no longer believed in, along with a detailed explanation for their changed position. While publicly discrediting one’s own work is retroactive, intellectual humility in science would be proactive — a way for researchers to avoid common pitfalls from the get-go, says Rohrer, of the University of Leipzig in Germany.</p>



<p>Because scientists’ careers often hinge on publishing research papers in top-tier journals, Hoekstra says, they can feel pressure to exaggerate their findings. Scientists might hype the novelty of a study, tinker with statistics to obscure uncertainties in the data, gloss over failed experiments or imply that theoretical results are closer to real-life application than they actually are. Problematically, Hoekstra says, the publication process rewards this behavior. Journal editors and paper reviewers who green-light studies tend to prioritize clear narratives over more nuanced ones.</p>



<p>Change needs to start with those gatekeepers, Hoekstra and Vazire argue. Reviewers especially can contribute to the solution without risking their careers. “Reviewing is one of the few positions in academia where you can freely say whatever you want,” Hoekstra says.</p>



<p>Below Hoekstra explains to <em>Science News</em> how each component of a scientific paper — from the abstract that sets up the work to the discussion that points to conclusions — can be imbued with intellectual humility.</p>



<h4>Title and abstract: </h4>



<p>Setting up the nuances at the top of a study is crucial. For instance, if the study was conducted with a limited pool of participants, researchers should not imply that their findings apply to all people. What’s more researchers should report on all the experiments that are part of the study, not just those that yielded the strongest results.</p>



<h4>Introduction: </h4>



<p>Researchers should refrain from exaggerating how much their findings advance current knowledge. They also shouldn’t cherry-pick among previous studies to make it sound like existing evidence overwhelmingly supports the new findings. Researchers often treat this part of the report as a persuasive argument, Hoekstra says. Instead, researchers should honestly address similar findings, as well as controversies or disagreements around the topic of research.</p>



<h4>Methods: </h4>



<p>The purpose of this section is for an outside researcher to be able to replicate the study by following the instructions, Hoekstra says. “The recipe should be so specific … that you can’t screw it up.” But scientists frequently omit details on timing. That includes basic details, such as what time of day data were gathered, as well as the timing of various decisions. For example, when in the process were certain participants excluded from the study? And what decisions were made before crunching the data versus afterward?</p>



<p>Though it is still an exception rather than a rule, a growing number of journals now require researchers to <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports">preregister their research plan</a> with an online services — spelling out their hypothesis, research design and analyses before beginning their research. That can help protect against bias. “Even if you don’t want to do anything bad, you want to play by the rules, the inclination is to fiddle around with your data to see what works and what doesn’t,” Hoekstra says.</p>



<h4>Results: </h4>



<p>Rather than focus on what the data show, researchers should focus on where the data might fall short. This approach might include conducting multiple analyses to understand how seemingly small decisions in the research design, such as what participants are excluded or how key variables are measured, affect the results.</p>



<p>And researchers should put their statistical findings in context. Outside the social sciences, this process may be relatively straightforward. Epidemiologists, for instance, can quantify how many dying patients a drug may save. But quantifying the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">effect of nostalgia on happiness</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic">how proneness to boredom affects whether people follow social distancing guidelines</a>, can be more challenging.</p>



<p>Researchers can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/courts-use-statistics-should-be-put-trial">conduct a Bayesian analysis</a>, which incorporates prior knowledge to predict the likelihood of a given outcome.</p>



<h4>Discussion: </h4>



<p>In the final words of a paper, researchers tend to present a more ironclad story than the data allow. Instead, researchers should reiterate potential flaws in the research design and honestly assess how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/culture-helps-shape-when-babies-learn-walk">broadly the results might apply</a>. Many reports, for instance, include a limitations paragraph briefly outlining the study’s potential shortcomings. Instead, those limitations should provide the backbone for the entire discussion.</p>



<p>“We typically sweep uncertainty under the rug in an attempt to be perceived as strong or knowledgeable,” Hoekstra says. “I think it would be much stronger to accept that there’s always uncertainty.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/assassin-bugs-tap-spider-prey-distract-lethal-strike">Assassin bugs tap spiders to distract them before a lethal strike</a></h4>

              
                <p>Assassin bugs live up to their name. The insects expertly stalk and feed upon other small invertebrates, jabbing them with a venomous proboscis. Some species even hunt spiders and use a strange trick to gain the upper hand.</p>



<p>Using their antennae, assassin bugs tap spiders, which <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blab128/6377909?redirectedFrom=fulltext">appears to discombobulate the arachnids long enough to let the bugs make a toxic strike</a>, researchers report September 29 in the <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>. The findings provide insight into some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">sophisticated hunting tactics</a> that predators evolve when targeting dangerous prey (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>Thread-legged bugs are a subfamily of particularly gangly assassin bugs, and some species spend their lives in a place most insects avoid: spider webs. The bugs silently creep along the spider’s silk, taking care to make their vibrations seem benign before violently dispatching the web’s architect, seizing the spiders with their front legs and injecting them with venom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While watching two species of <em>Stenolemus</em> assassin bugs hunt spiders, ecologists Anne Wignall and Fernando Soley took note of the bugs’ habit of lightly knocking their antennae on spiders once the bugs were within striking distance.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“It struck us early on that tapping prey was a really strange thing to do,” says Wignall, of Massey University in Albany, New Zealand. Spiders could easily defend themselves in a lethal fashion. “Watching [the bugs] spend so much time and effort on stealth, only to essentially tap [the spiders] on the shoulder was absolutely fascinating.”</p>



<p>To figure out why the bugs tap, Wignall and Soley, of the Organization for Tropical Studies in&nbsp;San José, Costa Rica, tested the behavior of 30 web-building cellar spiders (<a><em>Pholcus phalangioides</em></a>) in the laboratory. The researchers replicated the bugs’ antennae tapping by gently brushing the spiders’ leg with a dog hair. After the tapping, the team measured the spiders’ responses to a vibrating tuning fork placed on the web, mimicking a struggling insect.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>An assassin bug (<em>Stenolemus giraffe</em>, left) gently taps a spider (<em>Pholcus phalangioides</em>, right) with its long antennae before snatching the spider with its front limbs and delivering a venomous bite.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tapped spiders were far less aggressive than those that weren’t tapped, fully ignoring the fork four times as often. Tapped spiders also attacked the fork about 25 percent as often as their untapped counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wignall thinks that the assassin bugs are reducing spiders’ aggression levels by imitating the types of physical touch that these typically solitary spiders experience near fellow spiders. “Whenever they do come across another spider, it’s usually because it’s a close relative such as a sibling in the nest, or a potential mate. Both of which are situations in which aggression would not be a good idea,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invertebrate zoologist Ondřej Michálek of Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, who was not involved with the study, says that the researchers have a “completely valid hypothesis.” Many spiders avoid cannibalism by using special tactile signals that could be copied by adroit predators, thereby deceiving the arachnids, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, Wignall wants to understand the tapping in greater detail, determining how many taps are sufficient to pacify a spider and the number of spider species that the bugs are manipulating.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will begin working on the next round of Dev sessions: <a class="reference external" href="https://netpyne.org">NetPyNE</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org">NeuroML</a>, tools from the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuralensemble.org">NeuralEnsemble</a>&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>We agreed that our &#8220;Dev sessions&#8221; do not necessarily have to be developer centric only.
It is perfectly fine to also include user oriented information.
We suggest components of both.
We would like &#8220;Dev sessions&#8221; to remain informal where developers do not need to make formal presentations, and they should also remain different from traditional&nbsp;tutorials.</li>

<div class="section" id="citing-research-software">
<h3>Citing research&nbsp;software</h3>
<p>A large proportion of the meeting was dedicated to discussion around how we can ensure that software is correctly cited in research work to ensure that their authors get credit for their work.
This is especially important in the current scientific climate where publications and citations are used as proxies to gauge&nbsp;performance.</p>
<p>Some ideas that were discussed&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>using the right&nbsp;license</li>
<li>lists of good Free/Open Source licenses:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing#Good_Licenses">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing#Good_Licenses</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/">https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a good website providing quick license summaries is: <a class="reference external" href="https://tldrlegal.com">https://tldrlegal.com</a></li>
<li>publishing articles on Free/Open source software in focussed journals, for e.g.: <a class="reference external" href="https://joss.theoj.org/">https://joss.theoj.org/</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/">https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/</a></li>
<li>ensuring that tools get enough visibility, for example by making sure they are listed on websites dedicated to collecting Open Source tools for neuroscience, e.g.: <a class="reference external" href="https://open-neuroscience.com/">https://open-neuroscience.com/</a></li>
<li>also increasing visibility of research software using appropriate channels, e.g.: World Wide Neuro series for software: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.world-wide.org/Neuro/">https://www.world-wide.org/Neuro/</a></li>
<li>adding appropriate citation files to software projects, e.g. on GitHub: <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files</a></li>
<li>adding RRIDs for research software and using them in publications: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rrids.org/">https://www.rrids.org/</a> .
Some journals make it mandatory to cite software using RRIDs and then automatically link to the tool.<ul>
<li>eLife encourages it: <a class="reference external" href="https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies">https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies</a><ul>

                <p>An inexpensive, easy-to-take pill could be the next weapon in the arsenal against COVID-19. Taking the antidepressant fluvoxamine within days of showing symptoms of an infection can dramatically cut the risk of hospitalization and death, suggests the largest trial to date of this FDA-approved generic drug as a COVID-19 treatment.</p>



<p>In newly infected COVID-19 patients at high risk of complications, a 10-day course of the antidepressant fluvoxamine <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00448-4/fulltext">cut hospitalizations by two-thirds and reduced deaths by 91 percent</a> in patients who tolerated the medicine, researchers report October 27 in the <em>Lancet Global Health</em>.</p>

<p>Fluvoxamine is commonly prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disorder and acts by increasing levels of the brain chemical serotonin between nerve cells. Aside from those effects, the drug has other biological properties that could quell inflammation triggered by COVID-19, says child psychiatrist Angela Reiersen of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. She &nbsp;<a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/329200553/8/">stumbled onto the idea</a> to test fluvoxamine as a COVID-19 treatment while scouring papers during her own bout of illness early in the pandemic.</p>





<p>“This is an existing medicine with two to three decades of clinical use — something millions of people have taken,” says David Boulware, an infectious disease physician and researcher at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. “It’s available at every pharmacy in the U.S., and [a 10-day course] costs $10.” By comparison, a five-day course of Merck’s antiviral <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">molnupiravir</a> — another oral drug that can protect people from serious COVID-19 — carries a $700 price tag (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boulware was not involved in the latest trial but helped analyze results from a smaller study showing fluvoxamine’s promise as an early COVID-19 treatment. That study tested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-treatment">real-world use</a> of the antidepressant in workers who got infected during a COVID-19 outbreak at a California horse racing track last November (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>The new analysis was conducted as part of <a href="https://www.togethertrial.com/">TOGETHER</a> — an international collaboration launched last year to test multiple repurposed medications in placebo-controlled experiments at the same time. The study’s adaptive design allows investigators to remove treatments from the study when statistical analyses show the drugs offer no benefit, as has been the case for the antimalarial drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">hydroxychloroquine</a> and for ivermectin, a drug commonly used against parasites (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>).</p>

<p>For the new study, researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, partnered with the research clinic Cardresearch in Brazil to recruit 1,497 unvaccinated, high-risk adults in their first week of flu-like symptoms from COVID-19. Patients at 11 clinical sites in Brazil entered the trial between January and August, and received either 100 milligrams of fluvoxamine or placebo pills twice a day for 10 days.&nbsp;Investigators monitored participants for another 28 days after treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the placebo group, 119 of 756 patients, or 15.7 percent, developed complications requiring hospitalization or more than six hours of emergency care. In comparison, 79 of 741, or 10.7 percent, of fluvoxamine-treated patients got that sick. Taking fluvoxamine cut emergency visits and hospitalization by 32 percent, the trial found.</p>



<p>Among patients who took at least 80 percent of their doses, the benefits were even stronger. About three-fourths of patients fell into that group, with the most common reason for stopping the drug being gastrointestinal complaints. Fluvoxamine cut serious complications in that group by 66 percent and reduced mortality by 91 percent. In the placebo group, 12 patients died, compared with one who received the drug. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the latest data and fluvoxamine’s long-standing safety record, Reiersen says, “we believe it should be used in COVID-19 for patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality from complications of the infection.” According to Boulware, the expert panel that develops U.S. COVID-19 treatment guidelines was briefed on the data in mid-September and could decide soon about recommending fluvoxamine as an early treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sterile-neutrino-particle-physics-mystery-microboone">Doubt cast on theorized ‘sterile’ particles leaves a neutrino mystery unsolved</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, physicists have suspected an interloper. A reclusive, hypothetical subatomic particle might be creeping into studies of neutrinos, nearly massless particles with no electric charge. A new study casts doubt on that idea, but leaves unsolved the mystery of what caused peculiar results in certain neutrino experiments.</p>



<p>“We still don’t have the answer,” says physicist Kate Scholberg of Duke University, who was not involved with the new result. “It’s simultaneously satisfying and unsatisfying.”</p>



<p>Neutrinos, which come in three known varieties, have shown up in greater numbers than expected in some experiments. That strange behavior raised the tantalizing prospect that a stealthier fourth type of neutrino, called a sterile neutrino, might be awaiting discovery. But new data from the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment, or MicroBooNE, favor the canonical neutrino trio.</p>



<p>An earlier experiment called MiniBooNE, located at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., had for years found more neutrinos than expected at low energies, a hint <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-neutrino-surplus-hints-existence-new-particles">strengthened with more data</a> in 2018 (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>). An even earlier neutrino experiment, performed in the 1990s, had also seen a similar signal.</p>





<p>With MiniBooNE, scientists studied a phenomenon called neutrino oscillation. The three known varieties of neutrinos — electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos — can transform, or oscillate, from one type to another as they travel. MiniBooNE looked for electron neutrinos produced when muon neutrinos oscillated.The apparent glut of electron neutrinos seen by MiniBooNE could indicate that the switch seemed to happen more often than expected, potentially due to sterile neutrinos muddling up the oscillations.</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Particle detectors can’t directly spot neutrinos, instead identifying them by observing other particles spit out when neutrinos interact within a detector. And MiniBooNE tended to confuse electrons — a signature of electron neutrinos — with photons, particles of light that could indicate another particle. That left scientists unsure whether the excess events were really electron neutrinos. The sterile neutrino remained a question mark.</p>



<p>Enter MicroBooNE. Also at Fermilab, the experiment uses an advanced type of detector that can tell electrons from photons. So scientists set out to investigate the excess events — aiming to find out whether they involved electrons or photons. But MicroBooNE, confusingly, found no excess at all. In an <a href="https://theory.fnal.gov/events/event/search-for-anomalous-single-photon-production-in-microboone-as-a-first-test-of-the-miniboone-low-energy-excess/">October 1 seminar</a> and a paper posted at arXiv.org, MicroBooNE had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00409">mostly eliminated</a> the possibility of extra events involving photons. The new result, reported October 27 during a virtual seminar, rules out <a href="https://microboone.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/paper_electron_analysis_2021.pdf">many of the possible types of extra events involving electrons</a>, making the sterile neutrino idea less plausible.</p>



<p>It’s not clear why one experiment saw an excess while the other didn’t. The difference between the two measurements might come down to the different materials used in the detectors, Scholberg says — carbon in the case of MiniBooNE, argon for MicroBooNE.</p>



<p>Other possible explanations for the excess events that MiniBooNE found remain to be investigated, some of which might go beyond standard physics. The detections, for example, might involve electrons paired with their antimatter partners, positrons. That pair could point the finger at different hypothetical subatomic stuff, in particular, what’s called an axionlike particle.</p>



<p>The researchers “have eliminated a lot of possibilities of what this excess could be, so I found the results pretty compelling,” says physicist Mayly Sanchez of Iowa State University in Ames, who was not involved with the study. “You’re giving fewer and fewer places to hide to these sterile neutrinos.”</p>



<p>But all hope for sterile neutrinos is not lost: A more complicated scenario involving a sterile neutrino combined with other theorized new phenomena could still explain the excess events.</p>



<p>“There’s still a mystery afoot,” says physicist Bonnie Fleming of Yale University, a cospokesperson of the MicroBooNE experiment. “We have more work to do. There’s no doubt about that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolf-falkland-islands-origin-ancient-human-visitors-fire-hunt">Ancient human visitors complicate the Falkland Islands wolf’s origin story</a></h4>

              
                <p>The enigmatic, now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf had human visitors on the remote archipelago up to 1,070 years ago. The find suggests that Indigenous people could have originally brought the foxlike creatures, also known as the warrah, to the islands.</p>



<p>Scientists have debated how the islands’ only land mammal journeyed to the region: by a long-ago land bridge or with people. But little evidence of a human presence before Europeans arrived in 1690 had been found. Now, traces of ancient fires and hunting <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh3803">show that Indigenous people arrived on the Falkland Islands centuries prior to Europeans</a>, researchers report October 27 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The Yaghan people — historically fire-wielding seafarers who kept foxes as companions — may have been the visitors.</p>



<p>Abrupt spikes in charcoal levels in sediments offer “telltale signs of human arrival” from 1,070 to 620 years ago on New Island, says Kit Hamley, a paleoecologist and archaeologist at the University of Maine in Orono. Those spikes mirror later traces of Europeans’ fires around 250 years ago.</p>



<p>And massive piles of sea lion and penguin bones imply hunting by humans from 745 to 600 years ago, Hamley says. Before being hunted to extinction by Europeans in 1875, the Falkland Islands wolf (<em>Dusicyon australis</em>) also consumed marine predators such as sea lions and penguins, nitrogen levels in two warrah bones and one tooth show. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-600x450.jpg" alt="skull and teeth from a now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf" class="wp-image-3105227" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-560x420.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105227">A tooth and bones from a now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf (skull shown) revealed clues about the animal’s diet. Nitrogen levels show that the foxlike creature consumed seals and penguins.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105227">K. Hamley</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers newly dated that tooth and found it to be from 3,860 years ago. That vastly predates the fire-and-bone-pile evidence, leaving a gap “between when the warrah arrives, and when we can definitively say people were there,” Hamley says.</p>



<p>But Indigenous people’s presence up to 1,070 years ago raises new questions about whether the warrah hitchhiked there with earlier human visitors, Hamley says. </p>



<p>Next, Hamley and colleagues plan to partner with the few remaining Yaghan communities in Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to piece together “parts of the story that have been lost or taken away.”</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The emergency hospital, a partially demolished building hastily enclosed with wooden partitions, was about to open. It was the fall of 1918 in Philadelphia, and influenza was spreading fast. With many of the city’s doctors and nurses serving in World War I, 23-year-old Isaac Starr and his third-year classmates at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine needed to help tend the sick. They’d had just one lecture on influenza. Their first job was to assemble the hospital beds, about 25 to a floor.</p>



<p>Starr’s shift was 4 p.m. to midnight. The beds soon filled with <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-145-2-200607180-00132">patients who had fevers</a>, he recalled in a 1976 essay for <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Many who developed influenza recovered. But Starr witnessed some patients become starved for air, their skin turning blue. Soon, they were “struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth,” he wrote. “It was a dreadful business.”</p>

<p>There were no effective treatments. Patients, desperate for breath, became delirious and incontinent and would die within days. “When I returned to duty at 4 p.m., I found few whom I had seen before,” Starr wrote. “This happened night after night.” In October, around the pinnacle of the pandemic, roughly 11,000 Philadelphians perished.</p>



<p>Some who died in the makeshift hospital stuck with Starr. There was Mike the piano mover, who in a frenzy left his bed and was about to leap from a window before medical staff grabbed him. Mike died shortly after. There was the young woman, “flushed with fever,” whose large family kept vigil at her bedside, hoping for a recovery that never came.</p>



<p>An estimated 50 million people worldwide died of influenza during the 1918 pandemic. The century since has seen many vaccines and treatments become available to combat infectious diseases. But beyond those medical feats, the story of epidemics remains a story about people: people who become sick, people who die, people whose lives are upended, people who care for others. And ultimately, people who remember what happened and people who forget.</p>



<p>The public memory of the 1918 pandemic, which lasted into 1919, faded quickly in the United States, with few historical accounts or memorials to victims in the aftermath. One of the first major histories of the pandemic, by Alfred Crosby, didn’t arrive until 1976, the same year Starr published his reflections on serving in an influenza ward. Crosby’s book was eventually reissued with the fitting title <em>America’s Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918</em>.</p>

<p>Since 1918, we have faced many epidemics, but COVID-19 has been the first to rival the great flu in how it has changed everyone’s daily lives. “We are living through a historic pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>But a hundred years’ worth of advances in virology, medical understanding and vaccine development has made a difference. It was 11 months from the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to “having a vaccine that you could put in people’s arms,” Fauci says, “a beautiful testimony to the importance of investing in biomedical research.”</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is also a stark reminder of what hasn’t changed. “Pandemics just surface all the muck,” says internist, medical humanities scholar and historian of medicine Lakshmi Krishnan of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Ever present but often ignored societal inequities become unavoidable. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">disproportionate weight of COVID-19 disease and death on Black, Latino and Native American communities in the United States</a> — “we better not forget,” says Fauci. “We really need to address the social determinants of health that lead to these very, very obvious disparities.”</p>



<p>Yet outbreak after outbreak, our collective memory falters. The urgency of the predicament eventually fades. The families mourning the loss of loved ones, people struggling with unmet medical needs, with stigma, become small islands of remembrance ever threatened by vast seas of forgetfulness and indifference.</p>



<p>Sometimes forgetfulness comes from a lack of reckoning. The United States moved on from the 1918 pandemic without addressing what was lost. Sometimes the success of vaccines obscures their power. The fear that surrounded polio subsided in the United States after the country rolled up its sleeves for polio vaccines. The dread of many other childhood illnesses, such as diphtheria and measles, has also diminished, leaving some to take prevention measures for granted.</p>



<p>To look back at infectious diseases since 1918 is to observe what we’ve learned about the viruses, bacteria and fungi with which we share our world, and observe the strides made in lessening their harms. But it’s also a call to listen to the stories of how infectious diseases have shaped people’s lives.</p>



<p>Outbreaks “have occurred throughout history and they occur now,” Fauci says. “And they will continue to occur.”</p>





<h3>Vaccine victories</h3>



<p>On February 24, 1947, Eugene Le Bar, an American merchant, boarded a bus in Mexico City. During the trip, his head began to ache and he broke out with a rash. He arrived in New York City on March 1 still not feeling well. Four days later, he was admitted to the hospital. His stay overlapped with a mumps patient named Ismael Acosta and a little girl, almost 2, who had croup.</p>



<p>Le Bar deteriorated while doctors searched for a diagnosis. He died March 10. Acosta and the little girl had been discharged, but returned later in March with rashes. The results of tests for those two led to a review of Le Bar’s autopsy. The diagnosis was smallpox, a disease that kills about 30 percent of those sickened and leaves survivors disfigured by prominent scars.</p>



<p>More victims turned up. A little boy with whooping cough who had been at the hospital developed a rash. So did Acosta’s 26-year-old wife, Carmen, who died days later. Soon the number of people with smallpox reached 12. New York City embarked on a massive vaccination campaign.</p>



<p>At the time, Anthony Fauci was 6 years old, growing up in Brooklyn. He remembers his parents talking about a huge event that would be happening in the city. “We all had to get vaccinated, and vaccination means somebody would get a little needle and prick it multiple times in your arm.” (The smallpox vaccine wasn’t given as a shot; instead, a drop of vaccine was placed on the skin and a needle poked the skin repeatedly to usher the vaccine into the body.) Fauci and his family were among the millions of New Yorkers immunized that spring, bringing the smallpox outbreak to a close without another person added to the count.</p>

<p>Throughout history, smallpox was one of the most feared infectious diseases. A British historian, writing about the 1694 death of Queen Mary II from smallpox at age 32, described the disease as “always present, filling the churchyards with corpses, tormenting with constant fears all whom it had not yet stricken, leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous traces of its power.”</p>



<p>Smallpox is also a starring character in the story of vaccines. At the end of the 18th century, the English physician Edward Jenner extracted fluid from a sore caused by cowpox on a dairymaid’s hand and inoculated a young boy with it, a test of the belief among some farmers that getting sick with cowpox protected against smallpox. The experiment propelled forward the concept of vaccination. By giving the immune system a preview of the pathogen, the body’s defenses were prepared for the main event.</p>



<p>What followed exemplifies the fullest power of vaccination. After a worldwide campaign, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/no-more-smallpox">smallpox was the first infectious disease to be declared eradicated from the globe</a>, in 1980 (<em>SN: 11/03/79, p. 310</em>). A scourge that had plagued humankind for at least 3,000 years was consigned to the history books.</p>



<p>Other vaccine-preventable diseases — especially those that afflict children — harm many fewer around the world today than in the near past. During the 20th century in the United States, after vaccines became widely used for nine diseases, including polio, measles and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, cases declined by 95 to 100 percent. Yet there can be “a lack of appreciation for what vaccines have done in terms of getting rid of or managing many infectious diseases,” says virologist A. Oveta Fuller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>



<p>For many people today, an understanding of polio only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/polio-research-brings-hope">comes from history books</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/51, p. 42</em>). But others who grew up when summers meant polio outbreaks have sharp recollections.</p>



<p>Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was 5 years old in 1956. After surgery on his foot, he stayed for about six weeks in a Baltimore hospital’s chronic care facility. It was primarily a polio ward. He was surrounded by children whose limbs were suspended in traction or whose bodies were swallowed in iron lungs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="642" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung.jpg" alt="black and white photo of children inside an iron lung" class="wp-image-3105108" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-614x383.jpg 614w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-722x450.jpg 722w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-298x186.jpg 298w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-768x479.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-931x580.jpg 931w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105108">If polio impaired the muscles in the chest, patients would be placed in an iron lung, which forced air in and out of their lungs so they could breathe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105108">FOOD COLLECTION/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was a lonely, frightening experience,” Offit says. Parents were allowed to visit only one hour a week. He could see “how vulnerable and helpless and alone all of those children were.” Offit’s bed was next to a window, which gave him a view of the building’s front door. He’d stare at the entrance, “waiting for someone to come save me.”</p>



<p>Offit later trained at that same hospital as a medical student. The ward he had languished in as a child was now a suite of offices. The room looked the same, even the molding, “and that window was still there,” Offit says. “I remember walking up and looking out that window and seeing the same thing I saw 20 years earlier and just fighting back tears.”</p>



<p>Memorial Day weekend in the United States used to herald a season of polio fear, as cases rose in summertime. Children were barred from swimming pools and crowds. Fauci’s parents wouldn’t allow him and his sister to go to the beach at Coney Island. “All of us as kids knew somebody who’d been paralyzed,” says David Morens, Fauci’s senior scientific adviser, who grew up in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Vaccines provided an exit from this recurring nightmare. The two vaccines developed to thwart polio each drew on different advances. First came Jonas Salk’s “killed” polio vaccine, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/steps-polio-conquest">approved in 1955</a> (<em>SN: 4/16/55, p. 242</em>). Made with poliovirus that had been treated with formaldehyde, the virus could no longer cause harm, but the body could still mount an immune response against it. About seven decades earlier, Louis Pasteur had demonstrated that rabies virus could be inactivated to develop a rabies vaccine.</p>



<p>The second vaccine, Albert Sabin’s oral polio vaccine, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/oral-polio-vaccine-safe">became available in 1961</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/63, p. 370</em>). Often delivered on a sugar cube, Sabin’s easily digested vaccine was the inspiration for the song “A Spoonful of Sugar” in the movie <em>Mary Poppins</em>. Sabin’s approach was to weaken the poliovirus by making it replicate in nonhuman cells. Forced into an unfamiliar environment, the virus made genetic changes that diminished its ability to cause disease. This method, called attenuation, had first been used about 25 years earlier to create a yellow fever vaccine.</p>

<h3>Vanishing ailments</h3>



<p>Life before and after polio vaccines was like night and day. In 1952, polio paralyzed more than 21,000 people in the United States. Thirteen years later, that number had plummeted to 61. By 1979, polio was eliminated in the country. With new immunizations, one by one, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccine-vindication#slideshow">common childhood ailments all but vanished</a> in the United States: measles, rubella, chicken pox, and meningitis caused by bacteria.</p>



<p>When Kathryn Edwards trained in pediatrics in Chicago in the mid- to late 1970s, “we were really in the grips of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> meningitis.” (<em>H. influenzae</em>, formerly <em>Bacillus influenzae</em>, is the misnamed bacterium that had once been suspected of causing influenza.) She remembers seeing four or five children at a time hospitalized with this dangerous swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, says Edwards, an infectious disease pediatrician and vaccine researcher at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Some children with <em>H. influenzae</em> meningitis were left with brain damage, while about 5 percent died. Edwards still remembers a young patient lost to the disease the last night of her training.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/biomedicine-46">first vaccine against <em>H. influenzae</em> type b</a>, the type that most commonly caused meningitis and other severe infections, became available in the United States in 1985. More effective vaccines came a few years later, evaluated by Edwards and colleagues. Again the impact was unmistakable. Before 1985, close to 20,000 children, most of them under age 5, developed severe infections from <em>H. influenzae</em> type b each year, including 12,000 with bacterial meningitis. By 1994 and 1995, the incidence of severe disease had fallen 98 percent in children age 4 or younger. With the availability of vaccines against <em>H. influenzae</em> and other pathogens, “the practice of pediatrics is much different now than when I began 40 years ago,” Edwards says.</p>



<p>The scope of infectious diseases that children face worldwide is slowly changing too. From 2000 to 2018, 23 million deaths globally were prevented by measles vaccination. But there are still millions of children around the world missing out on basic immunizations that are routine in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the problem: An estimated 23 million children worldwide did not receive childhood vaccines in 2020; that’s about 3.7 million more than in 2019.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Big impact</h3>



<p>Vaccines that came into wide use in the 20th century against diphtheria, polio, measles and other diseases drastically reduced or, in the case of polio, eliminated the illnesses by the end of the century in the United States. Smallpox was globally eradicated by 1980.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed">work of developing vaccines</a> against COVID-19 began shortly after researchers worked out the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in January 2020. Previous studies of the coronaviruses behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/morbid-mystery-tour-epidemic-china-encircling-globe">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</a>, or SARS (<em>SN: 3/29/03, p. 198</em>), and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mers-outbreak-picks-pace-middle-east">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</a>, or MERS (<em>SN: 5/31/14, p. 6</em>), had identified a viral protein that would effectively ramp up an immune response.</p>



<p>And the basic research that would underpin a new vaccine technology, which would be used for two of the first COVID-19 vaccines, had been going on for decades. The approach is based on messenger RNA, or mRNA, which carries out of the cell nucleus the instructions for making a protein. The vaccines have the guide for the viral protein; the body makes that protein and produces antibodies against it. Some of the crucial work, modifying the instructions for the viral protein so the body wouldn’t see the guide as an invader, came from RNA biologist Katalin Karikó, immunologist Drew Weissman and colleagues working at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in the mid- to late 2000s.</p>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines were created and tested in the shortest timeline for any vaccines yet. But that efficiency wasn’t matched in the distribution. While <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">there haven’t been enough shots available globally</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 6</em>), the United States, a country awash in supply, has struggled to immunize everyone eligible. Some people haven’t been vaccinated because they can’t take time off work to recover from side effects or are worried they’ll have to pay for the shots. Others don’t see COVID-19 as a threat and don’t see the need for the vaccine.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has killed millions of people worldwide. Yet perhaps it would be more terrifying if it primarily threatened children. The horror of polio was that it could leave children paralyzed for the rest of their lives, Offit says; it was as though children had been injured in war.</p>



<p>Michigan’s Fuller thinks that seeing the harm that polio could do to children helped make Americans eager for polio vaccines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, “because we were all isolated, we didn’t see each other really suffering or dealing with the effects of this virus,” she says.</p>

<p>When virologist Katherine Spindler of the University of Michigan was growing up, she had measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccines for those afflictions “came along too late for me,” Spindler says. She still remembers the name of her older brother’s classmate who died in eighth grade of an infectious disease. The routine immunizations that are now regular parts of pediatrician appointments mean that most of us “don’t know what it’s like to have polio or to die from measles.”</p>



<p>Spindler found getting the COVID-19 vaccine “so meaningful,” thinking about all of the science that came together to develop it. People have e-mailed her with questions about the vaccine. One woman who had an appointment but wasn’t sure she wanted to keep it wrote several times. Spindler spent a few hours responding. Finally, she got an e-mail back with a picture of the woman in her car getting the shot. “Tears came to my eyes,” Spindler says. “One person vaccinated feels like such a victory.”</p>



<h3>The aftermath</h3>



<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lakshmi Krishnan and S. Michelle Ogunwole were internists at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Patients were dying. There wasn’t enough personal protective equipment for staff. So much about COVID-19 was still unknown. “It was terrifying,” says Krishnan, now at Georgetown University. Some of her colleagues were writing their wills.</p>



<p>And the patients were largely alone. Ogunwole, also a health disparities researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, remembers an older Black woman who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for months. She was well enough to move out of the intensive care unit but was extremely debilitated because she hadn’t walked in so long, Ogunwole says. A tube in her windpipe made talking difficult as well.</p>



<p>The woman’s family was not there. “There was nobody to speak for her,” Ogunwole says. It made Ogunwole think of her own mother, “an incredibly vibrant person … the life of the party.” If it was her mom in that bed, no one would have known who she is. That she likes to dance for no reason. That she picks up a different sport every year.</p>

<p>Ogunwole felt her patient’s sorrow and loss. Millions are reckoning with the pandemic’s cost to their physical and mental health. The toll is not unlike that of tuberculosis, AIDS, fungal diseases, childhood infectious diseases or the many other outbreaks and epidemics of the last century.</p>



<p>We should know by heart how lives — and whose lives — are changed by infectious disease outbreaks. But time and again, there’s a clamor to leave outbreaks behind us. And the trauma and the inequities linger. The question this time, says historian Nancy Bristow of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., is, “Can we do a better job of continuing to hear the stories of those who have been affected?”</p>



<p>The stories of children who have lost one parent or both, for example. For her book <em>American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic</em>, Bristow interviewed Lillian Kancianich, born in a small town in North Dakota. Kancianich’s mother died of influenza when Kancianich was a baby. The story was that her mother was out sweeping the porch on Armistice Day and then was never seen again, Bristow says.</p>



<p>Kancianich bounced among extended family members’ houses for two years before she was able to call one home. She told Bristow that as a child, when asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, her answer was, a stepmother. “The loss of that parent changed her life completely,” Bristow says.</p>



<p>These stories have continued. In roughly the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext#%20">1 million children worldwide experienced the death of a mother, a father or both</a>, researchers reported in July in the <em>Lancet</em>. The number is staggering, and yet it is a fraction of the estimated 17 million children who have lost one or both parents to AIDS in roughly the last three decades, according to the United States Agency for International Development. Ninety percent of those children live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Outbreak after outbreak, our collective memory falters. The urgency of the predicament eventually fades.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nearly 105,000 children in the United States are facing life without one or both parents due to COVID-19, the study in the <em>Lancet</em> found. “Evidence from previous epidemics shows that ineffective responses to the death of a parent or caregiver, even when there is a surviving parent or caregiver, can lead to deleterious psychosocial, neurocognitive, socioeconomic and biomedical outcomes for children,” the authors wrote.</p>



<p>An earlier study on parental death due to COVID-19 in the United States took race and ethnicity into account. While Black children make up only 14 percent of children in the United States, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2778229">they made up 20 percent of those who had lost a parent</a>, researchers reported in April in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>When Krishnan was treating patients early in the pandemic, she remembers noting, “It’s all my Black and brown patients that are getting upgraded to the intensive care unit.” Research has revealed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">a disproportionate impact among Black, Latino and Native Americans</a> in terms of infection, hospitalization and death.</p>



<p>“COVID has unveiled disparities in health,” but the pandemic didn’t create them, Fuller says. “This is not new.”</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, Black Americans’ death rates were higher than white Americans for tuberculosis, pneumonia and, in children, diarrheal disease and diseases of malnutrition, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in 1906, “an indication of social and economic position.” Racism and segregation restricted access to health care, housing and wealth for Black Americans.</p>



<p>The accounts from 1918 in Black newspapers in Philadelphia and Chicago “gave the impression that the epidemic did not substantially disrupt life in black communities,” <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00333549101250S314">wrote</a> Vanessa Northington Gamble in <em>Public Health Reports</em> in 2010. Yet it was clear that the number of Black people who did have flu “overwhelmed the medical care facilities that were available to them,” says Northington Gamble, a physician and medical historian at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. White hospitals wouldn’t accept Black patients or would send them to the basement or other segregated areas. Black hospitals didn’t have the capacity for everyone who needed care. So Black communities came together to provide for their own, she says.</p>

<p>When every one of the 75 beds at Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital in Philadelphia filled up, its medical director, with no support from the city’s board of health, managed to open an emergency annex for Black patients. Black women volunteers in Chicago made house visits to tend to the sick.</p>



<p>Black nurses also cared for Black influenza patients in their homes. Bessie B. Hawes, a 1918 graduate of the Tuskegee Institute’s nursing program, described her experience caring for a family of 10, “dying for the want of attention,” in a rural area of Alabama. “As I entered the little country cabin, I found the mother dead in bed, the father and the remainder of the family running temperatures of 102 to 104˚. Some had influenza and others had pneumonia…. I saw at a glance that I had much work to do…. I milked the cow, gave medicine, and did everything I could to help conditions.”</p>



<p>One of the legacies of the 1918 pandemic is “this long-standing tradition of the Black community of standing up and taking care of itself,” says Northington Gamble. The tradition continues, she says, with the work of organizations including the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, created to make it easier for Black communities in the Philadelphia area to receive COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</p>



<p>When Black people became ill with influenza in the 1918 pandemic, they were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678782/">more likely to die than white people with influenza</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>. That <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-2223">higher likelihood of death</a> “could be attributed to several factors still present today: higher risk for pulmonary disease, malnutrition, poor housing conditions, social and economic disparities, and inadequate access to care,” Krishnan, Ogunwole and their colleague Lisa Cooper of Johns Hopkins University wrote last year in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The societal systems that foster racial discrimination and lead to health inequities must be addressed, Ogunwole says. “There is no amount of resilience that overcomes that.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>We cannot forget because it will happen again.</p><cite>Lakshmi Krishnan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The suffering of the 1918 pandemic was overshadowed by the end of World War I, Bristow says. The war was publicly memorialized with monuments and a holiday. “The pandemic goes unspoken,” she says, because it doesn’t fit with the victorious narrative of the war. Only a few fictional works that drew upon the 1918 pandemic were published in the following decades.</p>



<p>But those books — such as the 1939 <em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em>, by Katherine Anne Porter, who survived an influenza illness but whose fiancé died — as well as private letters reveal deep loss, Bristow says.</p>



<p>“It’s very clear that the trauma stayed with people, even if there’s not public grieving, and that’s what’s so sad about it,” she says. “There was no public acknowledgment of all of this loss.” The country marched ahead, and people “were expected to hop in line and march along too.”</p>



<p>Krishnan, a historian of medicine, says we must preserve a record of the COVID-19 pandemic. A hopeful sign that stories of how people felt, lived, loved and died won’t be lost are the <a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/oralhistory/page/about">many oral history projects</a> spearheaded by <a href="https://incite.columbia.edu/covid19-oral-history-project">universities</a> and <a href="https://www.nypl.org/pandemic-diaries">libraries</a>. “We cannot forget,” Krishnan says, “because it will happen again.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-asian-mummies-bronze-age-ancestry-mystery">DNA from mysterious Asian mummies reveals their surprising ancestry</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mystery mummies from Central Asia have a surprising ancestry. These people, who displayed facial characteristics suggesting a European heritage, belonged to a local population with ancient Asian roots, a new study finds. Until now, researchers had pegged the mummified Bronze Age bunch as newcomers and debated about where in West Asia they originally came from.</p>



<p>Desert heat naturally mummified hundreds of bodies buried in western China’s Tarim Basin from roughly 4,000 to 1,800 years ago. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/indo-european-pursuits">Preserved remains of these people have been excavated since the 1990s</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/95</em>). Those interred around 4,000 years ago belonged to the Xiaohe culture, a population that mixed animal herding with plant cultivation. Their boat-shaped coffins were unlike any others in the region. And preserved cheese, wheat, millet and clothes made from western Eurasian wool found in Xiaohe graves pointed to distant contacts or origins.</p>



<p>Archaeogeneticist Yinqiu Cui of Jilin University in Changchun, China, and an international team analyzed DNA from 13 Tarim Basin mummies from roughly 4,100 to 3,700 years ago and five other human mummies from the nearby Dzungarian Basin from around 5,000 to 4,800 years ago.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="528" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1.jpg" alt="a cemetery in the desert with spiky protrusions pointing out from the sand in China's Tarim Basin" class="wp-image-3105210" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-493x383.jpg 493w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-580x450.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-240x186.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105210">Researchers collected DNA from mummified bodies at this Bronze Age cemetery in western China.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105210">Wenying Li/Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarim people <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04052-7">displayed Asian ancestry</a> mainly traceable to hunter-gatherers who inhabited much of northern Eurasia more than 9,000 years ago. That finding suggests that the mummies belonged to a population that did not mate with outsiders for many millennia, the researchers report October 27 in <em>Nature</em>. No DNA links were found to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">western Eurasian herders from the Afanasievo culture</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>), who some researchers have regarded as precursors of Xiaohe people.</p>



<p>A predominantly Afanasievo ancestry did appear in the Dzungarian individuals. Milk proteins found in dental tartar from seven Tarim mummies indicated that those people regularly consumed dairy products, a practice possibly learned from Afanasievo descendants in the Dzungarian Basin, the researchers say.</p>
