              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/xWOpNz-h49Q/">Announcing a new PLOS policy on inclusion in global research</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><a href="https://plos.org/about/">PLOS</a> empowers researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We push the boundaries of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to create a more equitable system of scientific knowledge and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are taking further steps to bring equity to publishing by launching a new policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities. Some global research has been criticised as being &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;. This occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their research, and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a>, implemented across all PLOS journals, aims to improve reporting of global research. Authors conducting research of this nature may be asked to complete a questionnaire that outlines ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research. The questionnaire also asks authors conducting research without local authors why none have been included on the authorship list. A reminder of the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/authorship">PLOS criteria for authorship</a> is also included, which states that all individuals who meet these criteria should be included in the author byline, rather than in the acknowledgements.</p>



<p>The information collected in the questionnaire will be made available to editors and reviewers during the peer review process to help assess whether the research meets the journal&rsquo;s standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity. The completed questionnaire will also be included as a Supporting Information file with the published paper, improving transparency in global research.</p>



<p>PLOS publishes research in over 200 disciplines and we recognise that expectations for conducting research may vary between fields. As such, at the time of launch, we won&rsquo;t have specific requirements for global research practices, beyond our existing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">policies</a>. Instead, we&rsquo;ll work with our community of reviewers and editorial board members to consider questions that arise from the policy on a case-by-case basis. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a> has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe, including researchers from South Africa, New Zealand, the USA, and Kenya. This has included individuals from multiple research areas, including population health, genetics, biological sciences and paleontology. We&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for their valuable input in developing the policy.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch of the new policy, some of the individuals involved in its development recently participated in a discussion with the title &lsquo;Inclusion in global science: Preventing &lsquo;parachute research&rsquo;. The panel discussed how parachute research is an offshoot of academic narcissism and the result of pervasive views that &lsquo;<em>we know best&rsquo;</em>, &lsquo;<em>we are the experts</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>we will tell you the solutions</em>&rsquo;. They further discussed the role for publishers, institutions and funders in preventing parachute research, before noting the importance of capacity building and local ownership of research programs in low- and middle-income countries.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-fossil-evidence-amber-spider-mom-care-young">This is the oldest fossil evidence of spider moms taking care of their young</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long before <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> walked the Earth, sap engulfed a spider guarding her egg sac.</p>



<p>Her corpse, preserved alongside her offspring in amber for 99 million years, is the oldest physical evidence for maternal care in spiders, says Paul Selden, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. This fossil is one of four showing that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1279">some ancient spiders guarded their egg sacs and may even have raised their young</a>, Seldon and his colleagues report September 15 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Maternal care, such as guarding eggs, is common among modern spiders. Some species even go so far as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-mom-nurses-her-brood-weeks-milk">nursing their young</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/18</em>) or serving themselves up as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-mom-serves-herself-dinner">their children’s first meal</a> (<em>SN: 4/21/15</em>). Because maternal care is so widespread, researchers suspected that spiders developed this behavior long before the Cretaceous Period, which began around 145 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this “is the first time we’ve seen evidence for this behavior in fossils,” says Selden. The female spider and her unborn offspring belong to a now-extinct family of spiders called Lagonomegopidae, distinguished by their large, reflective eyes. She and her kin would probably have hunted in trees at night.</p>



<p>Along with guarding their eggs, female spiders may have stuck around after the eggs hatched. Three of the chunks of amber contain dozens of week-old spiders. Spiders are usually solitary creatures, so the presence of multiple spiderlings side-by-side suggests that they didn’t disperse after birth, choosing instead to stay alongside their mother. </p>

<p>How long these spiders stuck around mom remains unclear. While the study “unequivocally” shows that these spiders were guarding their egg sacs during the mid-Cretaceous, “future researchers need to keep their eyes open for females with larger and older offspring,” says Linda Rayor, an entomologist at Cornell University who studies maternal care in spiders.</p>



<p>Researchers will have to look for further fossil evidence in existing museum and institutional collections. Some paleontologists are <a href="https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SVP-Letter-to-paleontological-community-on-Myanmar-Amber_FINAL.pdf">calling for a moratorium on publishing research on amber from Myanmar</a> mined after 2017 over concerns of inhumane conditions in mines and worries that the sale of amber was funding militant groups, a situation further exacerbated by the military coup in 2021. The pieces of amber used in this study are part of a pre-existing collection at the Capital Normal University in Beijing and were mined over a decade ago.</p>



<p>That moratorium shouldn’t hinder future discoveries, Selden says. “There are already thousands of specimens — and more material than there are people available to study it.”</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It can be hard to know what’s going to go viral — or even what’s going to get you just a few more likes. For many, however, expressing an outraged opinion on politics has been a good way of garnering interactions, even if it doesn’t <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/">always have the intended effect</a>.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641">new study</a>, published in <em>Science Advances</em> and authored by William Brady and colleagues from Yale University, looks more closely at how outrage spreads on social media. It finds that likes and shares&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;garnered by outrage act as a reward that &#8220;teaches&#8221; us to express more of the same.</p>



<span id="more-43939"></span>



<p>The team first trained a machine learning algorithm to classify tweets by whether or not they expressed outrage. The algorithm was trained on 26,000 tweets collected after a variety of incidents that sparked widespread outrage in the United States, such as the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and the Trump administration’s ban on transgender people in the military; some of these tweets contained outrage and some didn’t. The incidents were chosen because of their hypothesised resonance with different groups of people on the political spectrum; one, an incident showing an angry woman being ejected from a United Airlines flight, was non-political in nature.</p>



<p>Once trained, the algorithm was then used to analyse the entire tweet history of 7,331 Twitter users who had posted about these incidents, totalling around 12.7 million tweets. The team also gathered information on positive social feedback — i.e. likes and retweets — both in relation to outrage-specific posts and non-outraged posts. They also looked at the political ideology of both the poster themselves and their friendship network.</p>



<p>The results showed that people were more likely to express outrage if they had received more likes and retweets for an expression of outrage the previous day. In real terms, this meant that if someone received 100% more positive feedback than average for an outraged tweet, they were 2 to 3% more likely to show outrage the next day. This effect was, however, weaker for those who had been tweeting for a longer time, suggesting people become desensitised to this feedback over time.</p>



<p>As you might expect, those with stronger ideological leanings and who belonged to networks of similarly ideological people were more likely to express outrage on a political topic that pushed their buttons. However, while they showed more outrage overall, those who belonged to more extreme networks were less likely to respond to social feedback — that is, those with moderate political networks were more likely to adjust their behaviour in response to likes and shares on outraged posts. Expressions of outrage, then, are based not only on norms — e.g. what others are saying — but on reinforcement behaviours too.</p>



<p>In the next part of the study, participants engaged with a platform designed to simulate Twitter, viewing 12 posts commenting on contentious topics — Trump, Medicare for All, US immigration policy, and Extinction Rebellion. In the outrage condition, 75% of the tweets seen by participants expressed outrage, while participants in the neutral condition saw no outrage at all. The amount of positive feedback varied underneath each post, with those in the outrage condition seeing a higher number of likes and shares on the outraged posts.</p>



<p>After scrolling through the tweets, participants completed a learning task, in which they had to share content&nbsp;with the end goal of maximising likes and shares. Participants were presented with two tweets discussing the same political topics, one containing outrage and one neutral, and indicated which they wanted to share. They were immediately given feedback on their choice, with outrage posts on average getting more shares and likes.</p>



<p>Again, both norms and reinforcement impacted how often participants expressed outrage. Those in the outrage condition, who had seen more outraged posts to begin with, were more likely to select an outraged tweet than a neutral one in the learning stage, while those in the neutral condition were more likely to select a neutral tweet. But participants in both conditions were also impacted by reinforcement, selecting more outraged posts over time as they got feedback on their choices (though the effect of this was weaker in those who had primarily seen neutral posts).</p>



<p>So, overall, social feedback in the form of likes and shares &#8220;teach&#8221; people to express more outrage. While we may be more likely to express outrage if our friends or followers also do, through norm learning, those with moderate political networks are particularly sensitive to reinforcement via likes and shares.</p>



<p>“Amplification of moral outrage is a clear consequence of social media’s business model, which optimizes for user engagement,” <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">says</a> senior author Molly Crockett. “Given that moral outrage plays a crucial role in social and political change, we should be aware that tech companies have the ability to influence the success or failure of collective movements.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691229003">Ice Rivers</a><br><em>Jemma Wadham<br>Princeton Univ., $26.95</em></p>



<p>I’ve always been a sucker for glacier lingo, whimsical words for a harsh landscape gouged, smoothed and bulldozed by ice. Moulins, drumlins, eskers and moraines. Cirques and arêtes. Cold katabatic winds blowing down a mountain, huffed from a glacier’s snout and said to be its spirit.</p>



<p>Jemma Wadham’s <em>Ice Rivers: A Story of Glaciers, Wilderness, and Humanity</em> leans into this duality of whimsy and harshness, cheerfully pulling readers into this strange, icy world. Wadham, a glaciologist at the University of Bristol in England, confesses that her goal is to give readers a sense of connection to glaciers, which she knowingly anthropomorphizes: In her writing, glaciers have heavy bodies, dirty snouts and veins filled with water.</p>





<p>“When I’m with them, I feel like I’m among friends,” she writes. “It is, in many ways, a love story.” And knowing the glaciers, she reasons — perhaps coming to love them — is key to trying to save them.</p>





<p>Accordingly, the book’s chapters are anchored by site, and each chapter documents a different field expedition or series of expeditions to a particular glacier. Wadham takes us from the Swiss Alps to Norway’s Svalbard islands, from India’s Himalayas to Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. It’s a breezy read, with an eager party host vibe (“let me introduce to you my friend the glacier; I think you two will get along”).</p>



<p>While describing each site, Wadham dives into an engaging mishmash of personal recollections about her fieldwork, snippets of accessible glacier and climate science (I now know that these rivers of ice have three different manners of flow), a dash of alpine and polar exploration history, and many bits of local color. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/otzi-mummy-ate-high-fat-meal-before-death">Ötzi the 5,300-year-old iceman</a>, Erik the Red, Svalbard’s many polar bears and wild Patagonian horses all make an appearance, not to mention the mummified corpses of seals and penguins littering the Dry Valleys (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>An interesting thread winding through the book concerns how the focus of glaciology as a field has shifted through time. After several years of not winning grants that would allow her to continue working on Svalbard, in 2008 Wadham got the opportunity to go to Greenland instead. “Valley glaciers were no longer considered quite as cutting-edge to the research council funders,” she writes. “Instead, glaciologists had become obsessed with the vast ice sheets,” for the potential of their meltwaters to raise sea levels and alter ocean currents. Several years later, funders began to call for projects looking at melting glaciers’ impacts on ocean life and the water cycle, opening up an opportunity for Wadham to study Patagonia’s fast-changing glacial region.</p>



<p>Where the book really comes alive is in its vivid snapshots of a scientist’s life in the field: making a bleary-eyed cup of coffee in Patagonia using a thin sock as a filter; fearfully skittering across fragile fjord ice on a Ski-Doo; consuming tins of bland <em>fiskeboller</em>, or fish balls, which were mostly used for food but sometimes for rifle practice; solo dancing away a gray mood on a pebbly beach on Svalbard, with a rifle ready to repel polar bears resting nearby on the stones.</p>



<p>These recollections are honest, funny and poignant, and reveal how the highs and lows of fieldwork are inextricably intertwined. Wadham writes, for example, of dreading the “hollow feeling caused by constant sleep deprivation” due to the midnight sun and the relentless roaring of winds and water, a feeling tempered by her fierce love for the open expanses of the wild and for pursuing a “big mission.”</p>



<p>She also writes wistfully of the “communal mirth of field-camp life” where she had never laughed as much before and, less wistfully, of the heavy, claustrophobic atmosphere of an Antarctic research station with its supercharged heating system and extreme politeness over meals with strangers. Against the backdrop of Patagonia’s swiftly shrinking glaciers, Wadham comes to grips with difficult personal losses, even as she wrestles with mysterious headaches. Months later, while recovering from emergency brain surgery, she secretly begins to write about her glaciers. Still more months pass before she finds her way back to the ice, this time in the Peruvian Andes.</p>



<p>“I quickly realized one key thing about fieldwork — if you think you are there to work, you’re gravely mistaken,” Wadham writes. “You’re actually there to survive, and perform some research along the way — if you’re lucky.… In some ways I found all this ‘surviving’ a grounding process.” </p>



<p>Every glacier Wadham has studied has shrunk since she first set foot on the ice over a quarter century ago. But <em>Ice Rivers</em> isn’t focused on mourning those glaciers so much as on celebrating the peace and purpose — the grounding line — Wadham found in them. It certainly makes me want to know them better.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">Rice feeds half the world. Climate change’s droughts and floods put it at risk</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Under a midday summer sun in California’s Sacramento Valley, rice farmer Peter Rystrom walks across a dusty, barren plot of land, parched soil crunching beneath each step.</p>



<p>In a typical year, he’d be sloshing through inches of water amid lush, green rice plants. But today the soil lies naked and baking in the 35˚ Celsius (95˚ Fahrenheit) heat during a devastating drought that has hit most of the western United States. The drought started in early 2020, and conditions have become progressively drier.</p>



<p>Low water levels in reservoirs and rivers have forced farmers like Rystrom, whose family has been growing rice on this land for four generations, to slash their water use.</p>



<p>Rystrom stops and looks around. “We’ve had to cut back between 25 and 50 percent.” He’s relatively lucky. In some parts of the Sacramento Valley, depending on water rights, he says, farmers received no water this season.</p>





<p>California is the second-largest U.S. producer of rice, after Arkansas, and over 95 percent of California’s rice is grown within about 160 kilometers of Sacramento. To the city’s east rise the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, which means “snowy mountains” in Spanish. Rice growers in the valley below count on the range to live up to its name each winter. In spring, melting snowpack flows into rivers and reservoirs, and then through an intricate network of canals and drainages to rice fields that farmers irrigate in a shallow inundation from April or May to September or October.</p>



<p>If too little snow falls in those mountains, farmers like Rystrom are forced to leave fields unplanted. On April 1 this year, the date when California’s snowpack is usually at its deepest, it held about 40 percent less water than average, according to the California Department of Water Resources. On August 4, Lake Oroville, which supplies Rystrom and other local rice farmers with irrigation water, was at its lowest level on record.</p>

Ogasa</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not too long ago, the opposite — too much rain — stopped Rystrom and others from planting. “In 2017 and 2019, we were leaving ground out because of flood. We couldn’t plant,” he says. Tractors couldn’t move through the muddy, clay-rich soil to prepare the fields for seeding.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0140-y">Climate change is expected to worsen</a> the state’s extreme swings in precipitation, researchers reported in 2018 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. This “climate whiplash” looms over Rystrom and the other 2,500 or so rice producers in the Golden State. “They’re talking about less and less snowpack, and more concentrated bursts of rain,” Rystrom says. “It’s really concerning.”</p>



<p>Farmers in China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam — the biggest rice-growing countries — as well as in Nigeria, Africa’s largest rice producer — also worry about the damage climate change will do to rice production. More than 3.5 billion people get 20 percent or more of their calories from the fluffy grains. And demand is increasing in Asia, Latin America and especially in Africa.</p>



<p>To save and even boost production, rice growers, engineers and researchers have turned to water-saving irrigation routines and rice gene banks that store hundreds of thousands of varieties ready to be distributed or bred into new, climate-resilient forms. With climate change accelerating, and researchers raising the alarm about related threats, such as arsenic contamination and bacterial diseases, the demand for innovation grows.</p>



<p>“If we lose our rice crop, we’re not going to be eating,” says plant geneticist Pamela Ronald of the University of California, Davis. Climate change is already threatening rice-growing regions around the world, says Ronald, who identifies genes in rice that help the plant withstand disease and floods. “This is not a future problem. This is happening now.”</p>

<h3>The top rice producers are in Asia</h3>



<p>The world’s top rice producer is China, at 214 million metric tons. India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are next. In Africa, Nigeria (6.8 million) is the largest producer.

<h4>Saltwater woes</h4>



<p>Most rice plants are grown in fields, or paddies, that are typically filled with around 10 centimeters of water. This constant, shallow inundation helps stave off weeds and pests. But if water levels suddenly get too high, such as during a flash flood, the rice plants can die.</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between too much and too little water can be a struggle for many rice farmers, especially in Asia, where over 90 percent of the world’s rice is produced. Large river deltas in South and Southeast Asia, such as the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, offer flat, fertile land that is ideal for farming rice. But these low-lying areas are sensitive to swings in the water cycle. And because deltas sit on the coast, drought brings another threat: salt.</p>



<p>Salt’s impact is glaringly apparent in the Mekong River Delta. When the river runs low, saltwater from the South China Sea encroaches upstream into the delta, where it can creep into the soils and irrigation canals of the delta’s rice fields.</p>

<p>“If you irrigate rice with water that’s too salty, especially at certain [growing] stages, you are at risk of losing 100 percent of the crop,” says Bjoern Sander, a climate change specialist at the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI, who is based in Vietnam.</p>



<p>In a 2015 and 2016 drought, saltwater reached up to 90 kilometers inland, destroying 405,000 hectares of rice paddies. In 2019 and 2020, drought and saltwater intrusion returned, damaging 58,000 hectares of rice. With regional temperatures on the rise, these conditions in Southeast Asia are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/publications/ready-dry-years-building-resilience-drought-south-east-asia-2nd-edition">expected to intensify and become more widespread</a>, according to a 2020 report by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</p>



<p>Then comes the whiplash: Each year from around April to October, the summer monsoon turns on the faucet over swaths of South and Southeast Asia. About 80 percent of South Asia’s rainfall is dumped during this season and can cause destructive flash floods.</p>



<p>Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone rice producers in the region, as it sits at the mouths of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers. In June 2020, monsoon rains flooded about 37 percent of the country, damaging about 83,000 hectares of rice fields, according to Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture. And the future holds little relief; <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg3848">South Asia’s monsoon rainfall is expected to intensify with climate change</a>, researchers reported June 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<h4>A hot mess</h4>



<p>Water highs and lows aren’t the entire story. Rice generally grows best in places with hot days and cooler nights. But in many rice-growing regions, temperatures are getting too hot. Rice plants become most vulnerable to heat stress during the middle phase of their growth, before they begin building up the meat in their grains. Extreme heat, above 35˚ C, can diminish grain counts in just weeks, or even days. In April in Bangladesh, two consecutive days of 36˚ C destroyed thousands of hectares of rice.</p>



<p>In South and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF001992?af=R">such extreme heat events are expected to become common</a> with climate change, researchers reported in July in <em>Earth’s Future</em>. And there are other, less obvious, consequences for rice in a warming world.</p>



<p>One of the greatest threats is bacterial blight, a fatal plant disease caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae</em>. The disease, most prevalent in Southeast Asia and rising in Africa, has been reported to have cut rice yields by up to 70 percent in a single season.</p>



<p>“We know that with higher temperature, the disease becomes worse,” says Jan Leach, a plant pathologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Most of the genes that help rice combat bacterial blight seem to become less effective when temperatures rise, she explains.</p>



<p>And as the world warms, new frontiers may open for rice pathogens. An August study in <em>Nature Climate Change</em> suggests that as global temperatures rise, rice plants (and many other crops) at northern latitudes, such as those in China and the United States, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01104-8#Sec19">will be at higher risk of pathogen infection</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, rising temperatures may bring a double-edged arsenic problem. In a 2019 study in <em>Nature Communications</em>, E. Marie Muehe, a biogeochemist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, who was then at Stanford University, showed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12946-4">under future climate conditions, more arsenic will infiltrate rice plants</a>. High arsenic levels boost the health risk of eating the rice and impair plant growth.</p>

<h3>Leaching in</h3>



<p>When grown in a greenhouse at 5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures with elevated carbon dioxide levels (representing a future climate), California rice varieties absorbed more of a type of highly toxic arsenic from the soil, raising the rice’s arsenic levels above European Union safety thresholds.</p>

<p>Arsenic naturally occurs in soils, though in most regions the toxic element is present at very low levels. Rice, however, is particularly susceptible to arsenic contamination, because it is grown in flooded conditions. Paddy soils lack oxygen, and the microbes that thrive in this anoxic environment liberate arsenic from the soil. Once the arsenic is in the water, rice plants can draw it in through their roots. From there, the element is distributed throughout the plants’ tissues and grains.</p>



<p>Muehe and her team grew a Californian variety of rice in a local low-arsenic soil inside climate-controlled greenhouses. Increasing the temperature and carbon dioxide levels to match future climate scenarios enhanced the activity of the microbes living in the rice paddy soils and increased the amount of arsenic in the grains, Muehe says. And importantly, rice yields diminished. In the low-arsenic Californian soil under future climate conditions, rice yield dropped 16 percent.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, models that forecast the future production of rice don’t account for the impact of arsenic on harvest yields. What that means, Muehe says, is that current projections are overestimating how much rice will be produced in the future.</p>



<h4>Managing rice’s thirst</h4>



<p>From atop an embankment that edges one of his fields, Rystrom watches water gush from a pipe, flooding a paddy packed with rice plants. “On a year like this, we decided to pump,” he says.</p>



<p>Able to tap into groundwater, Rystrom left only about 10 percent of his fields unplanted this growing season. “If everybody was pumping from the ground to farm rice every year,” he admits, it would be unsustainable.</p>



<p>One widely studied, drought-friendly method is “alternate wetting and drying,” or intermittent flooding, which involves flooding and draining rice paddies on one- to 10-day cycles, as opposed to maintaining a constant inundation. This practice can cut water use by up to 38 percent without sacrificing yields. It also stabilizes the soil for harvesting and lowers arsenic levels in rice by bringing more oxygen into the soils, disrupting the arsenic-releasing microbes. If tuned just right, it may even slightly improve crop yields.</p>



<p>But the water-saving benefits of this method are greatest when it is used on highly permeable soils, such as those in Arkansas and other parts of the U.S. South, which normally require lots of water to keep flooded, says Bruce Linquist, a rice specialist at the University of California Cooperative Extension. The Sacramento Valley’s clay-rich soils don’t drain well, so the water savings where Rystrom farms are minimal; he doesn’t use the method.</p>



<p>Building embankments, canal systems and reservoirs can also help farmers dampen the volatility of the water cycle. But for some, the solution to rice’s climate-related problems lies in enhancing the plant itself.</p>

<h4>Better breeds</h4>



<p>The world’s largest collection of rice is stored near the southern rim of Laguna de Bay in the Philippines, in the city of Los Baños. There, the International Rice Genebank, managed by IRRI, holds over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds from farms around the globe.</p>



<p>Upon arrival in Los Baños, those seeds are dried and processed, placed in paper bags and moved into two storage facilities — one cooled to 2˚ to 4˚ C from which seeds can be readily withdrawn, and another chilled to –20˚ C for long-term storage. To be extra safe, backup seeds are kept at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation in Fort Collins, Colo., and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault tucked inside a mountain in Norway.</p>



<p>All this is done to protect the biodiversity of rice and amass a trove of genetic material that can be used to breed future generations of rice. Farmers no longer use many of the stored varieties, instead opting for new higher-yield or sturdier breeds. Nevertheless, solutions to climate-related problems may be hidden in the DNA of those older strains. “Scientists are always looking through that collection to see if genes can be discovered that aren’t being used right now,” says Ronald, of UC Davis. “That’s how <em>Sub1</em> was discovered.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="684" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg" alt="two people in blue jumpsuits looking at rice seeds on shelves" class="wp-image-3103845" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-577x383.jpg 577w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-678x450.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-873x580.jpg 873w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103845">Over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds fill the shelves of the climate-controlled International Rice Genebank.

<p>The <em>Sub1</em> gene enables rice plants to endure prolonged periods completely submerged underwater. It was discovered in 1996 in a traditional variety of rice grown in the Indian state of Orissa, and through breeding has been incorporated into varieties cultivated in flood-prone regions of South and Southeast Asia. <em>Sub1</em>-wielding varieties, called “scuba rice,” can survive for over two weeks entirely submerged, a boon for farmers whose fields are vulnerable to flash floods.</p>



<p>Some researchers are looking beyond the genetic variability preserved in rice gene banks, searching instead for useful genes from other species, including plants and bacteria. But inserting genes from one species into another, or genetic modification, remains controversial. The most famous example of genetically modified rice is Golden Rice, which was intended as a partial solution to childhood malnutrition. Golden Rice grains are enriched in beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. To create the rice, researchers spliced a gene from a daffodil and another from a bacterium into an Asian variety of rice.</p>



<p>Three decades have passed since its initial development, and only a handful of countries have deemed Golden Rice safe for consumption. On July 23, the Philippines became the first country to approve the commercial production of Golden Rice. Abdelbagi Ismail, principal scientist at IRRI, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks">blames the slow acceptance on public perception and commercial interests opposed to genetically modified organisms</a>, or GMOs (<em>SN: 2/6/16, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, it will be crucial for countries to embrace GM rice, Ismail says. Developing nations, particularly those in Africa that are becoming more dependent on the crop, would benefit greatly from the technology, which could produce new varieties faster than breeding and may allow researchers to incorporate traits into rice plants that conventional breeding cannot. If Golden Rice were to gain worldwide acceptance, it could open the door for new genetically modified climate- and disease-resilient varieties, Ismail says. “It will take time,” he says. “But it will happen.”</p>



<p>Climate change is a many-headed beast, and each rice-growing region will face its own particular set of problems. Solving those problems will require collaboration between local farmers, government officials and the international community of researchers.</p>



<p>“I want my kids to be able to have a shot at this,” Rystrom says. “You have to do a lot more than just farm rice. You have to think generations ahead.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Climate-resilient rice</h4>



<p>To keep rice bowls around the world full, researchers breed new varieties of rice that can endure stresses like drought, floods and salt.</p>



<p><strong>Sahbhagi Dhan</strong>: Traditional rice varieties take 120 to 150 days to harvest and require four irrigations. Sahbhagi Dhan is a drought-tolerant variety harvested after 105 days and just two irrigations. In normal conditions, it produces about twice as much rice (four to five metric tons per hectare) as other local varieties in India. Under drought conditions, it produces one to two metric tons per hectare; local varieties produce none.</p>

<p><strong>Scuba rice</strong>: <em>Sub1</em>, a submergence-tolerance gene, has been bred into scuba rice varieties. Rice normally dies after three to four days of total submergence — many varieties will exhaust themselves to death trying to quickly grow to the water’s surface. <em>Sub1</em> varieties (shown), however, refrain from this frenzied growth spurt, and can withstand over two weeks underwater, able to survive the sudden floods of the summer monsoon.</p>



<p><strong>Salt-tolerant rice</strong>: Made by inserting an area of the genome called Saltol, salt-tolerant rice varieties are better able to regulate the amount of sodium ions, toxic in high amounts, in their tissues. Saltol has been incorporated into high-yield varieties throughout the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bats-drink-blood-friends-strangers-social">Bloodthirsty vampire bats like to drink with friends over strangers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Vampire bats may be bloodthirsty, but that doesn’t mean they can’t share a drink with friends.</p>



<p>Fights can erupt among bats over gushing wounds bit into unsuspecting animals. But bats that have bonded while roosting <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001366">often team up to drink blood</a> away from home, researchers report September 23 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vampire bats (<em>Desmodus rotundus</em>) can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-friendships-endure-captivity-wild">form long-term social bonds</a> with each other through grooming, sharing regurgitated blood meals and generally hanging out together at the roost (<em>SN: 10/31/19</em>). But whether these friendships, which occur between both kin and nonkin, extend to the bats’ nightly hunting had been unclear. “They’re flying around out there, but we didn’t know if they were still interacting with each other,” says Gerald Carter, an evolutionary biologist at Ohio State University in Columbus.</p>



<p>To find out, Carter and his colleague Simon Ripperger of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, built on <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31364-8">previous research</a> that uncovered a colony’s social network using bat backpacks. Tiny computer sensors glued to 50 female bats in Tolé, Panama, continuously registered proximity to other sensors both within the roost and outside, revealing when bats met up while foraging.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Two common vampire bats feed on a cow near La Chorrera, Panama. It can take 10 to 40 minutes for a bat to bite a small, diamond-shaped wound into an animal’s flesh, and fights can sometimes break out over access to wounds. But researchers found that bats who are friendly back at the roost likely feed together in the field, potentially saving time and energy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bat buds rarely left the roost together, suggesting that they don’t go on tightly coordinated hunts, Carter says. But bats with a history of associating with one another were more likely than strangers to meet up in the field and likely feed together, the researchers found. Rendezvous with friends also lasted longer, on average, than other interactions. That was especially true for bats with many roost buddies.</p>



<p>“These are more or less haphazard encounters,” Carter says. He suspects that the bats mostly forage alone, but when they encounter a friendly bat on a cow, for instance, they’ll feed together instead of fighting or flying off to find other food. Biting a new wound can take 10 to 40 minutes, Carter says, so sharing with a friend could save these bloodthirsty bats time and energy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">‘Ghost tracks’ suggest people came to the Americas earlier than once thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Footprints left behind by prehistoric people may be some of the strongest evidence yet that humans arrived in the Americas earlier than previously thought. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 60 “ghost tracks” — so-called because they pop up and disappear across the landscape — show that people romped through what’s now New Mexico 23,000 to 21,000 years ago, geoscientist Matthew Bennett and colleagues report in the Sept. 24 <em>Science</em>. If true, the fossil findings would be definitive proof that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7586">humans were in North America during the height of the last ice age, </a>which peaked around 21,500 years ago.</p>



<p>When people first arrived in the Americas is highly contested. Scientists have historically thought that humans traveled across the Bering land bridge that connected Asia to North America around 13,000 years ago, after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">the massive Laurentide Ice Sheet</a> that once blanketed much of North America had started retreating into the Arctic (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>). But a slew of more recent discoveries from across North and South America — including roughly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">30,000-year-old animal bones from a Mexican cave</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/texas-toolmakers-add-debate-over-who-first-americans-were">stone tools</a> from Texas (<em>SN: 7/11/18</em>) — suggest that humans may have arrived far earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At White Sands National Park in New Mexico, Bennett, of Bournemouth University in Poole, England, and colleagues used several methods to calculate the ages of the newly described tracks, including radiocarbon dating of aquatic plants embedded in and between the footprints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“One of the beautiful things about footprints is that, unlike stone tools or bones, they can’t be moved up or down the stratigraphy,” he says. “They’re fixed, and they’re very precise.”</p>



<p>But some archaeologists aren’t yet convinced of the footprints’ ages. Loren Davis, an anthropologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, says that he would like to see the researchers use other validation techniques to check the dates before “breaking out the champagne.”</p>



<p>“This is the kind of stuff that makes you rewrite textbooks,” Davis says. “For the good of the field, we need really high standards.” But if further verification confirms the age of the tracks, he says the discovery will “show us that people have this amazing ability to survive and thrive during a time when global conditions were extreme.”</p>



<p>The tracks were created over two millennia mostly by children and teenagers wandering through the patchwork of waterways that defined the White Sands area during the Ice Age, the researchers say. The footprints were found alongside those of mammoths, giant ground sloths and other megafauna that flocked to water in the largely arid landscape.</p>



<p>Bennett is planning on returning to White Sands after the pandemic to continue studying human footprints, hoping to learn more about the people who made them. “Footprints have a way of connecting you to the past that’s like nothing else,” he says. “It’s very powerful to put your finger in the base of a track and know that someone walked that way 23,000 years ago.”</p>

<p><strong>PLOS:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>How did you become involved with HERI?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong>&nbsp;I am a post-doctoral research fellow in HERI following a successful application.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong>&nbsp;I got involved with HERI after they advertised for their Advancing&nbsp;Womxn PhD fellowship post.&nbsp;With the help of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archaeology.uct.ac.za/age/faculty-and-staff/jayne-wilkins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jayne Wilkins</a>, I applied, and I got the funding.&nbsp;Before I applied, I had met&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geology.uct.ac.za/robyn/pickering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Robyn Pickering</a>&nbsp;working in the field.&nbsp;We were both part of the group that was excavating and researching in&#8239;Tswalu&#8239;(as part of the&nbsp;North of&#8239;Kuruman&#8239;project&nbsp;in the Northern Cape of South Africa);&nbsp;she was blown away by my passion for Middle Stone Age archaeology and dedication to excavating very hard ancient lake deposits. She advised me to apply for the Advancing&nbsp;Womxn fellowship and this is how I become part of the HERI team.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>I think my story with HERI is a little unorthodox in that I only found about it early last year. After my Masters, I took&nbsp;my first&nbsp;six month&nbsp;hiatus from academics since 1998!&nbsp;So, when I decided to go back to school, I needed an academic home. I also needed a change after getting all my other qualifications from the same institution. So, on one fateful January evening last year, after drafting an email for what now seems like days, I hit the &ldquo;Send&rdquo; button, said a quick prayer and hoped for the best. In this email, I was introducing myself and asking&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Robyn Pickering to be my academic supervisor. Coincidentally, she was also looking for a new student to take up space and be an&nbsp;Advancing&nbsp;Womxn&nbsp;Fellow and that is how my journey with HERI started. So, I guess&nbsp;HERI&nbsp;and I found each other, and the rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong> At&nbsp;the end of 2020, in line with their mission, HERI advertised two postdoctoral fellowships seeking African researchers under their Carnegie DEAL fellowships and I applied for&nbsp;one of the positions&nbsp;relating to reconstructing past climates to work with Dr. Robyn Pickering. I officially joined HERI in June 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What does your&nbsp;own&nbsp;research entail?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>My research project examines the highly dynamic social practices through which communities around archaeological heritage sites become exposed (and influenced) in their everyday life to the influx of travelers, heritage experts, tourists, curators, and most importantly for this study, international scientists, not least archaeologists, and&nbsp;paleo-anthropologists. This cosmopolitan group is involved in, and benefits from the construction of heritage and science narratives for diverse reasons and interests.&nbsp;My research interrogates the historical influences of sciences and heritage program narratives in archaeology including examining who owns, constructs, and controls the narratives and who does not and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong>&nbsp;My research is entitled<em>; Early human social transmission during MIS 5: A perspective from the Kalahari Basin</em>. This research focuses on social transmission in the Kalahari Basin during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, dated 130-74 ka, a key period for understanding the emergence and expansion of modern humans. I am studying and comparing MIS 5 lithic assemblages from multiple sites within the Kalahari Basin, employing and building upon Tostevin&rsquo;s (2012) cultural transmission approach. The main MIS 5 samples understudy comprise those at Ga-Mohana, Kathu Pan,&#8239;Wonderwerk, Bundu,&#8239;Erfkroon, and&#8239;Florisbad&#8239;in South Africa, #Gi and White Paintings in Botswana. My research is against the background that humans have been passing on information from one group to the other;&nbsp;thus,&nbsp;I use stone artifacts to help piece together a fuller picture of how early humans emerged, expanded, and shared information over time in the Kalahari Basin.&#8239;The research&nbsp;aims to produce a detailed account of the MIS 5 lithic technology in this region, thus shedding light on the degree and nature of social interaction in the Kalahari, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;works&nbsp;toward correcting the geographic bias toward coastal regions in southern Africa.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>My research focuses on using the only accelerator mass spectrometer in Africa and the&nbsp;Southern&nbsp;Hemisphere to understand southern African landscape evolution. I use cosmogenic nuclides,&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>Be and&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>Al to understand the rates of erosion along mixed-bedrock alluvial&nbsp;anabranching&nbsp;rivers in South Africa. Understanding how these rivers have eroded&nbsp;will allow us to understand how they have developed. This will also inform how these rivers have contributed to those who have lived nearby&nbsp;and relied on them over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>My new research project will investigate vegetation and climate dynamics over the last approx. 250,000 years in South Africa&rsquo;s interior using phytolith analysis&nbsp;that is, microscopic&nbsp;plant silica remains that will be&nbsp;extracted&nbsp;in the laboratory from sediment cores obtained from the&nbsp;Kalkkop&nbsp;Crater in the Eastern Cape.&nbsp;My current&nbsp;research focuses on work that is part of multidisciplinary projects at various archaeological sites in South Africa where I apply the same technique to investigate early human-plant and -environmental interactions to understand the type of plants they&nbsp;utilized, their&nbsp;behavior,&nbsp;and surrounding vegetation and climate and how these might also have influenced their&nbsp;behavior.&nbsp;I therefore mainly seek to provide a past environmental context to&nbsp;studies that study early human behavior and their cultures.&nbsp;I also have a keen interest&nbsp;in improving&nbsp;the dentification&nbsp;and interpretation of phytoliths in ancient sediments. Researchers achieve&nbsp;this by studying phytoliths produced in modern&nbsp;plants and the&nbsp;soils&nbsp;under them.&nbsp;In that regard, a lot of my research also focuses on&nbsp;studying&nbsp;phytoliths in modern&nbsp;South African plant types&nbsp;mainly grasses, sedges and trees/shrubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;HERI encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines &ndash; from&nbsp;palaeoscience&nbsp;to anthropology.&nbsp;Do you think this interdisciplinary approach provides opportunities for more comprehensive and collaborative research?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of the many strengths within HERI, because diversity in research promotes better science and opportunities for diverse and multidisciplinary teams for comprehensive understanding of human origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>Yes,&#8239;this interdisciplinary approach is good, and it provides collaborative research.&#8239;An interdisciplinary concept/ approach involves crossing various scientific disciplines or fields and integrating different ideas into cohesive thoughts so that we work in unison to accomplish a common goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely! This is something that more institutions and science in general really need to invest in. So much more can be&nbsp;answered&nbsp;and new questions can be asked from an interdisciplinary approach. From just spending time (in these virtual times) with other students at HERI and engaging in&nbsp;#AcademicTwitter&nbsp;over the last 18 or so months, I have come to learn so much about other people&rsquo;s work and there always seems&nbsp;to be a link between disciplines that can be identified and that is evidence of how more comprehensive and collaborative research can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Certainly. For one, most research teams are now focusing on using various disciplines to answer the questions they have because often one discipline or a single proxy cannot provide all the answers. In my experience with such institutes,&nbsp;one gains immense general knowledge from the various disciplines involved&nbsp;and the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;think&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;one&rsquo;s field&nbsp;for&nbsp;research&nbsp;questions&nbsp;and potential&nbsp;collaborations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;As part of the Advancing Womxn program, the HERI Fellows receive field training and mentorship &ndash; how has this made a difference in your career? Why do you think that these kinds of opportunities for women in traditionally male-led research areas are important?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Mentorship in traditionally male led research areas is important in grooming young female researchers to thrive in careers in academia,&nbsp;which promotes diversity in research questions and therefore better scientific research results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I am yet to participate in any HERI field trip (because I am still new). But so far, I have received mentorships through HERI winter series that are held&nbsp;online&nbsp;beginning of every month. These winter series have helped me intensely in my&nbsp;carrier&nbsp;especially the one that had to do with mental health in academia.&nbsp;This was a good talk given the background that most of us have suffered the mental effects that have been brought by the pandemic.&nbsp; We have also been advised on how to manage stress in these stressful pandemic times. These kinds of opportunities are important especially to us as women because studies have shown that women are more likely than men to have a great deal of stress.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I joined HERI just before the national lockdown started, so I did not get to be involved in,&nbsp;nor have I participated in,&nbsp;any field training as such. However, I do have prior field training from my studies over the years and HERI has also introduced me to the women-only field excursion,&nbsp;which I think is an incredible initiative&nbsp;that&nbsp;I really hope I can participate in one day. I think it is so important to have initiatives such as these because who better to understand challenges faced by women than women? I believe the excursion workshop creates a safe space for women to be open about the different challenges that we experience in the spaces we are in.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>Our first field work was cancelled when South Africa went into another lockdown,&nbsp;but I look forward to the field experiences and programs at HERI especially those that present new dimensions from my previous experiences. To answer the last part of your question, I would simply ask why would we even need to explain their importance? Opportunities for women in these disciplines should be a given in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century so these fields need to catch up! Before getting into the&nbsp;palaeosciences&nbsp;in South Africa, I don&rsquo;t think that I had ever conceptualised &ldquo;male-dominated&rdquo; fields in&nbsp;this&nbsp;sense. My lecturers in Biology and Chemistry where both men and women with PhDs so gender is not something I quickly saw as a limiting factor until I switched disciplines or countries so to speak &ndash; to a discipline that is rare in my country and yet common in South Africa. I did not imagine that women interested in these field should have to deal with misgivings based on their gender and race but alas the atmosphere and its&nbsp;issues can be palpable and are lived experiences for many who in turn&nbsp;are tasked with explaining&nbsp;&lsquo;the why&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;HERI researchers often challenge the traditional narratives that govern our understanding of human evolution. What new things have you learned&nbsp;as part of your work with the institute that have surprised you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>As HERI drives African-led research on human evolution, the institute also provides a conducive environment for female researchers to inspire and mentor one another, producing greater appreciation of human evolution research from a minority group within a male-led discipline and diversifying the voices that construct narratives of the African Past. I am from the background of&nbsp;Humanities and&nbsp;Social&nbsp;Sciences, but I have never felt out of place in HERI. I gain much from the interdisciplinary exchange that also strengthens my own research with an awareness of a wide range of lenses and many levels in human origins&nbsp;research.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I am still yet to learn new things;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;HERI challenges traditional narratives in human evolution. Some of HERI&rsquo;s research in the interior &ldquo;Kalahari basin&rdquo; led by Dr Jayne Wilkins&nbsp;developed&nbsp;theories that say our&nbsp;ancestors&nbsp;evolved behaviors are seen as &lsquo;modern&rsquo; at&nbsp;about 100 thousand years ago along the coast&nbsp;are&nbsp;too simplistic. The research provides&nbsp;valuable insights into the evolution of modern human behavior in the interior South Africa, thus diverting from the traditional narratives that behaviors were seen as &lsquo;modern&rsquo; at about 100ka along the coastal regions.&#8239;Women are drastically under-represented in&nbsp;palaeo-sciences (archaeology and human evolution). Women in science are working in a male dominated field and they have been fighting for equality for a long time.&nbsp;Although the situation seems to have improved,&nbsp;the struggle to be part of editorial boards or get leadership position still rages on, thus I applaud the HERI advancing womxn fellowship&nbsp;programme&nbsp;for empowering black women and giving us an opportunity to rise and shine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>My work at HERI fits well into the change that HERI strives to bring in science as it aims to challenge&nbsp;the&nbsp;Southern Africa landscape evolution narratives. It was so refreshing to find that so many HERI students and fellows are challenging narratives through their work. I think the one thing that has really stood out for me at HERI is how involved they are in the development and progress of their students. At previous institutions, I never used to meet in a group with other students for status update meetings or student-supervisor one on one meetings as frequently as we do at HERI. It is&nbsp;really new&nbsp;and different,&nbsp;but I really appreciate it as it promotes accountability and allows you to also see your progress. I wish others would adopt this because it is so important to share the journey as it can be quite taxing, both physically and emotionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>I would say my surprise with HERI came&nbsp;early on in&nbsp;the&nbsp;discoveries made during my&nbsp;application&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;from&nbsp;before from their presence on social media&nbsp;&ndash; to&nbsp;see two white women spearheading the discussions about these traditional narratives and questioning them. For me, this was a first in general&nbsp;in the several years I have lived in South Africa.&nbsp;It has always baffled me to begin with that it is the &lsquo;minority&rsquo; in these fields always in the thick of these discussions and fighting to be heard. Otherwise,&nbsp;I am certain there will be a lot of learning&nbsp;in regards to&nbsp;the&nbsp;results of the&nbsp;human evolution research&nbsp;being conducted by researchers and students&nbsp;at HERI&nbsp;that investigate those narratives.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of you have not yet had an opportunity to begin&nbsp;your fieldwork. For those of you who have,&nbsp;tell us about one of your&nbsp;memorable&nbsp;field campaigns or an aspect of field training you loved (or hated!).</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>I have had some field experience and as I finish typing this, I am on my way back to Johannesburg from one in the Kruger National Park working towards my PhD qualification. I think this may have been my most memorable field experience yet. Growing up, my family was always fond of visits to the&nbsp;park&nbsp;and I was always okay with it because we always stayed in the car. This&nbsp;particular experience&nbsp;came with me having to get out of the car and walk along a major river, in the wild! That was a literally wild and interesting experience for me, one I am sure to never forget. I conquered real fears out&nbsp;there&nbsp;but I am&nbsp;really proud&nbsp;of myself for showing up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong>&nbsp;It is challenging to conduct field work among human participants&nbsp;in the midst of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Covid-19 pandemic. I am currently conducting field work in a community that depended on the revenue from international tourists&nbsp;in Botswana. Witnessing the impact of the pandemic in this community is an uncomfortable experience. I have also been confronted with situations&nbsp;where, during&nbsp;first&nbsp;few days of field&nbsp;work&nbsp;people told me what they thought I wanted to hear&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;conversations/interview responses seemed guarded and defensive.&nbsp;However, after spending an extended amount of time&nbsp;in the field, researcher-participant relations&nbsp;slightly fade into&nbsp;more of&nbsp;a social space encounter than an &ldquo;academic/ insider-outsider binary&rdquo;. I love this about the field.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong> I am yet to participate in any HERI field trip. This is because of the pandemic. I would wish to participate in future HERI fieldworks and field camps, because these are women&rsquo;s field camps and they are free of the hierarchy, and women&rsquo;s harassment and actual sexual assaults. Women&rsquo;s field camps also give an opportunity to engage and learn more about other women and share our different experiences in the science field. HERI field camps also prepare women for how to deal with issues of harassment in the science field and ensure their safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;Archaeology and anthropology have been historically vulnerable&nbsp;to &lsquo;parachute research&rsquo;, where researchers from other nations arrive at a country of interest and conduct research without consulting or&nbsp;crediting&nbsp;any of the local population. Have you ever seen or heard of researchers doing this, and how do you think programs like HERI help to address this important issue?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>In addressing the question of parachute research, part of my project investigates the outcomes within the public sphere, of the recent publication by Chan et al (2019) entitled &ldquo;Human origins in a southern African paleo-wetland and first migrations&rdquo;. The authors infer that &lsquo;anatomically modern humans&rsquo; originated in the Makgadikgadi&ndash;Okavango&nbsp;palaeo-wetland of southern Africa around 200 thousand years ago.&#8239;The study used maternal mitochondrial DNA data as&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy for populations,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the results locate a southern African &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo; in the residual Makgadikgadi-Okavango wetlands. Contrary to these claims, hominin fossil data from across Africa show the presence of characteristics of Homo sapiens more than 300 thousand years ago at the opposite end of the continent (Hublin&nbsp;2017). In&nbsp;addition, recent works in&nbsp;palaeoanthropology&nbsp;indicate that the evolution of Homo sapiens primitive features is found across time and space, and this data does not indicate a single point of origin. This study produced questionable results, lacked diversity, and ignored the recent work of scholars in the region,&nbsp;which misrepresented the science of human origins in Africa,&nbsp;yet had access to high profile and extensive media coverage and a broader dissemination of data which attracted the attention of varied interest groups. This paper echoes a status quo in Southern Africa in which no authority is given to the scientific observations or interpretive models developed by scholars from the region. The authority remains exclusively in the hands of western and foreign scientists. HERI offers a platform that makes room for local and marginalized voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I think in Archaeology this is a thing of the past now. HERI and other disciplines in Archaeology are trying&nbsp;by all means to&nbsp;de-colonise&nbsp;Archaeology and this is another aspect that is improving. Scholars now give credit to the local communities, and this is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;This has not been any different in Geology, where I am registered. I am almost confident in thinking that &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; is a science-wide&nbsp;issue. Personally, I feel proud of being a part of an institute such as HERI which exposed me to the Advancing&nbsp;Womxn&nbsp;Fellowship, which supports African-led research about Africa, in Africa by empowering black women in science. This is a big contributing factor towards challenging &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; as it equips African researchers with resources to do their science boldly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Yes,&nbsp;I have seen it&nbsp;and also&nbsp;heard of it as a lived experience for many&nbsp;colleagues from various disciplines&nbsp;researchers and it is a general problem for research in Africa&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not just Archaeology and Anthropology. It has led to various platforms raising concern about &lsquo;research for whom&rsquo; and concepts of&nbsp;&lsquo;neo-colonialism&rsquo;. HERI emphasises African-led research and&nbsp;its&nbsp;stance on&nbsp;colonial&nbsp;practices is clear,&nbsp;but I believe it will ultimately be up to African researchers and especially their governments to put an end to this practice by&nbsp;changing&nbsp;how research practices operate on the continent.&nbsp;As far as I know this&nbsp;local&nbsp;involvement is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;requirement for research permits&nbsp;in South&nbsp;Africa&nbsp;unlike in&nbsp;East&nbsp;African countries&nbsp;although this&nbsp;has not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;changed&nbsp;the&nbsp;narrative.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;recently&nbsp;seen&nbsp;adverts&nbsp;calling for researchers to apply for funding and&nbsp;they categorically&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that those&nbsp;with their &ldquo;parachute&rdquo; approach need not apply.&nbsp;Clearly,&nbsp;the funders&nbsp;are now&nbsp;questioning&nbsp;the&nbsp;practice.&nbsp;This will likely&nbsp;force a&nbsp;change in this&nbsp;practice&nbsp;but not&nbsp;a&nbsp;real&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;ending the&nbsp;practice.&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;that&nbsp;individual&nbsp;African researchers&nbsp;should&nbsp;be accountable for their role in&nbsp;encouraging it.&nbsp;Can you imagine the hoops and loops African researchers would have to jump if for some reason they think&nbsp;of&nbsp;and want to excavate an archaeological site&nbsp;or&nbsp;take&nbsp;sediment cores from&nbsp;a lake&nbsp;in&nbsp;say&nbsp;Europe and&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;material&nbsp;back to&nbsp;Africa?&nbsp;I&nbsp;am assuming here that they are jumpable to start with.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;PLOS is a champion of &ldquo;Open Science&rdquo;. This includes not only open access to&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;publications, but Open Data,&nbsp;code sharing,&nbsp;transparent peer-review, etc. How do you think Open Science&nbsp;can&nbsp;benefit your research field?&nbsp;How can it benefit your community?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>With the current climate of the Covid-19 pandemic and reduced physical contact, I believe as researchers we benefit from platforms that open the research discussions beyond physical contact and promote continuous feedback outside of physical contact through workshops and conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong> Open science can benefit my research because it will&nbsp;publicise&nbsp;my work such that it becomes available to whomever may need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>There are a few things that stand out for me about &ldquo;Open Science&rdquo;; exposure and accessibility, reproducibility and building. I cannot count the number of times I have tried to find articles or journals only to get access to just an abstract. This seems to me like a block towards building the scientific body of knowledge and education in general. Open Science can benefit more than just my field of research and community because it will expose the future generation, who are curious about science and building their futures, and are already de-motivated&nbsp;by&nbsp;how difficult it must be if access to information is already restricted. Open&nbsp;Access&nbsp;to publications will open science. Another thing that stood out for me during my&nbsp;Master&rsquo;s&nbsp;years was the concept of &ldquo;Reproducibility&rdquo;. When I was writing my methodology chapter, I kept being reminded about this, because&nbsp;in order for&nbsp;someone else to learn, they need to understand what I did and be able to do it again and get similar results. This meant to me that more than being able to prove how credible the work was, it was going to allow someone else to do what I did with different samples in a completely different location and build the database of results using the same methods I did. So open access will allow for a more exponential growth in research and science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Open data science in my opinion plays an important role for people from countries where their institutions may not always subscribe to what allows easy access of&nbsp;information&nbsp;for example publications.&nbsp;On the whole, I think it is important to allow for reproduction of the work, comparisons and future use by those after us. Mainly also because interpretations may vary within the discipline, it is important to put it all out there to encourage&nbsp;discussions&nbsp;especially for the research methods. As for how it can benefit my community&hellip;that is a tough one if the community in this case is the general public as this kind of data is often in a format that they are not seeking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nucleotide excision repair is an essential mechanism to remove bulky DNA adducts, including UV-induced DNA lesions. Many techniques have been developed to detect DNA damage and repair, some of which are based on Next Generation Sequencing, providing genome-wide information.</p>
<p>To date, genome-wide repair maps have been generated for model organisms, including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, <em>Mus musculus</em>, and <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Akkose <em>et al.</em> wanted to compare repair patterns between humans and a deeply diverged non-human primate, selecting the gray mouse lemur, <em>Microcebus murinus</em>. A recent chromosome level reference genome for the gray lemur revealed that mouse lemur and human orthologs share ~ 91% identity, though we currently lack an in-depth understanding of this species’ genomic features such as epigenetic maps, transcriptomes and methylomes.</p>
<p>Given that mouse lemurs and humans last shared a common ancestor at the base of the primate clade, the same cell types from human and mouse lemur should behave similarly in response to DNA damage as a reflection of their deep homology. This study obtained transcriptomes from mouse lemur fibroblasts, exposed cells to UV and performed XR-seq, then compared lemur and human fibroblast XR-seq datasets for their genomic repair distribution. The results of this study demonstrated that the genome-wide UV repair profiles between humans and the gray mouse lemur are strongly correlated.</p>

<p>Therapeutic climbing has long been believed to have a positive effect on health problems, especially on perceived self-efficacy. Now, a trial carried out in Germany has shown that bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) leads to a relevant enhancement of perceived self-efficacy in people with depression, results which seem comparable to cognitive behavioural therapy. In fact, the effect of the BPT was noted to be superior compared to the effect of solely physical exercise.</p>
<p>BPT is carried out in groups by climbing therapists, and entails bouldering exercises, mindfulness exercises, psychoeducation, exchange between participants and transfer to daily life, body-related relaxation exercises, and free bouldering. Future studies should hopefully focus on whether BPT is also beneficial for other mental or physical disorders.</p>

<p>People experiencing homelessness have high levels of dental decay, oral cancer and poor oral health-related quality of life. The Scottish Government sought to address these issues by developing a national oral health improvement programme for people experiencing homelessness, named Smile4life. However, was this a successful program, was it being implemented in the best possible way? This study from the University of Dundee and University of St Andrews sent out surveys in Scotland, aimed at participants working within the homelessness sector or within NHS Boards where they were associated with services for people experiencing homelessness. The results from this survey identified recommendations that may be used to promote the future delivery of Smile4life, and support practitioners. Future steps should include training centred on the specific needs of those involved in the homelessness sector and the development of accessible training resources, thereby promoting implementation behaviours to assist the progression and sustainability of the Smile4life programme.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of dengue increased. Dengue is the most common arboviral infection affecting humans in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Every year, an estimated 96 million dengue infections are reported with 21,000 deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>Co-infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus is a serious public health concern due to the overlapping clinical and laboratory features of both diseases, making diagnosis and management of both diseases difficult. Despite similarities in signs and symptoms (like fever, headache and body pain), and laboratory characteristics (like thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) of these two diseases, their management is completely different. Hence, specific tests using RT-PCR or ELISA are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of these diseases.</p>
<p>Delayed diagnosis of co-infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus can result in serious patient complications with poor outcomes. The systematic review from Tsheten <em>et al.</em> underscores the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis using virus-specific tests.</p>

<p>Randomization is the foundation of any clinical trial involving treatment comparison. It helps mitigate selection bias, promotes similarity of treatment groups with respect to important known and unknown confounders, and contributes to the validity of statistical tests.</p>
<p>Various randomization procedures are available, so how do you choose the best one? This paper provides a roadmap to using randomization in clinical trials, taking into account a variety of factors and methodologies. Berger <em>et al.</em> conclude that the choice of randomization design, data analytic technique (parametric or nonparametric), and analysis strategy (randomization-based or population model-based) are all very important considerations. Randomization-based tests were found to be robust and valid alternatives to likelihood-based tests and should be considered more frequently by clinical investigators.</p>

<p>To increase <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/springboard/blog/blogposts-trust-integrity/strengthening-trust-in-peer-review-through-transparency/18399148">openness and transparency into the peer review process</a> and also to enable increased diversity in our reviewer pool, the BMC Series has introduced <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a>. The BMC Series was the pioneer of open peer review that requires that the reviewer’s identity is revealed to the authors. For transparent peer review, reviewer reports are published for all peer reviewed content and reviewers can choose to remain anonymous or sign their report. The move to transparent peer review followed community feedback that reviewers being required to share their name was a barrier for them agreeing to review. Some reviewers may be hesitant to have their name shared, particularly if they are at an early stage in their career or are concerned with having their name revealed to the authors and the public. Giving the option to sign a report allows reviewers to choose for themselves whether they want to reveal their identity.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting peer reviewers<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12535" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p>Reviewing for the first time might seem daunting and there may be uncertainty on what is expected from a reviewer and how to prepare a report. By providing support and guidance for our reviewers, we hope to increase clarity on the peer review process and increase their confidence in their role as a reviewer. The BMC Blog Network has resources on ‘<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/tag/how-to-peer-review/">how to peer review for beginners</a>’ that will guide novice reviewers in their role. <em>BMC Medicine</em> has a <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/peerreviewtips">collection</a> of commissioned articles from experts in different types of research methodology that provides peer review tips for junior reviewers.</p>
<p>At the BMC Series, we want to support those who review for us and provide them with the information they need when reviewing a manuscript for a BMC Series journal. We have created the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/for-reviewers">BMC Series Reviewers&#8217; page</a> that provides a guide on responding to our invite to review, how to assess and prepare a report for a BMC Series manuscript and what to expect after reviewing. Editors from the BMC Series were also involved in developing statistics checklists for editors and reviewers to use when evaluating the statistics in manuscripts and these are now part of our <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#standards+of+reporting">standards of reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Editors across the selective BMC journals (<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Biology</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Medicine</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Biology</em></a> and <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Medicine</em></a>) and the BMC Series are taking part in an initiative launched in 2020 by Nature Communications to engage specifically with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23455-8">early career researchers (ECRs)</a>. The ECR program aims to support ECRs in becoming effective peer reviewers, provide outreach and instruction to ECRs on how to properly review manuscripts, and identify potential ECR candidates in order to expand current reviewer pools.</p>
<p><em>BMC Biology</em> and <em>BMC Medicine</em> have recently adopted a collaborative editorial model that directly involves Editorial Board Members in the assessment, handling, and decision making of manuscripts, granting the opportunity to scientists to manage the peer review process, while being fully supported by experienced in-house editors. The Editorial Board Member model has an open call on the journals’ websites for those interested in becoming EBMs. In addition, <em>BMC Biology</em> offers the opportunity to scientists to apply to become <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQUInBDnH_GI9mAN82kjgBQpzsDxKCtpY2gIlOt4yan6-erg/viewform">reviewers</a> at the journal.</p>
<p>We hope that providing training, resources, and opportunity will remove the barrier that researchers may face through lack of experience as a reviewer or not understanding the process and expectations. This will enable us to expand and diversify our reviewer pools by giving more people the guidance needed to be a reviewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing inclusivity and diversity</strong></p>
<p>We continue to explore new approaches to increase diversity and inclusivity in the people who review for our journals. <em>BMC Psychology</em> has launched a new collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PDRI">Psychology of Diversity: The Road from Racism to Inclusion</a>’ that encourages submissions of research on diversity, equity and inclusion. The journal is taking applications from researchers who are interested in being a reviewer for this collection and with the journal’s transparent peer review, they can choose to have their name publicly shared if the paper is published.</p>
<p><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders </em>and <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> have launched a joint collection that is focussed on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PPI-RMD">Patient and Public Involvement in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Research</a>. The collection will allow interested patients, carers and members of the public to be involved in the peer review process. This will give them insight into scientific publishing and a voice in research.</p>
<p>Reviewers’ time is extremely valuable and often the reviewers we contact will not be available to review a manuscript. We encourage these reviewers to provide suggestions of alternative researchers when declining our invitation. We aim for gender, race, ethnic, geographic, career stage and other diversity in our reviewer pool. Our peer review invitations ask that reviewers consider alternative reviewers from underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
<p>Our resources will keep being developed to ensure that all reviewers are informed and supported in their role. Greater recognition needs to be given to early career researchers who peer review with their supervisor. We will look at how the names of those who contributed to a reviewer report can be included and credit given to acknowledge their work. As research and community standards advance, publishing needs to also develop. One example is the move to open data and data sharing. Building opportunities for early career researchers to review standardised format articles such as <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/data-note">Data Notes</a> so they can use their expertise to ensure community standards are adhered to. In the future we hope to create initiatives to ensure that reviewers from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented communities are afforded opportunity, encouraged, and supported.</p>
<p>BMC is committed to progressive and innovative approaches in publishing. By working with the research community and listening to their feedback, we will continue to make peer review more transparent and inclusive.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>There’s nothing less funny than explaining a joke. But analysing humour can actually tell us a lot about the development of sympathy and empathy in children.</p>



<p>Having a joke land is a complex task which requires an in-depth understanding of both the situation and mental state of the person on the receiving end. One audience, for example, might find a joke hilarious, whereas another might find that same joke wildly offensive.</p>



<p>Zeroing in on the appropriate joke, therefore, is likely to require a good amount of empathy. This ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of your audience is pivotal to humour being well-received, but the relationship between humour and empathy has only been addressed in a handful of studies so far. However, <a href="https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1934/1934.pdf">new research</a> from Caitlin Halfpenny and Lucy James at Keele University gives us a window into how empathy shapes humour by taking a look at junior schoolchildren’s use of jokes, and the different humour styles that emerge with different levels of empathy and sympathy.</p>



<span id="more-43919"></span>



<p>The team asked 214 junior school children aged between 9 and 11 years old to complete two self-report questionnaires. The first, the Humour Styles Questionnaire for young children (HSQ-Y), was used to identify which of four types of humour style the kids use: <em>self-enhancing</em> and <em>affiliative</em>, which are both adaptive humour styles, and <em>aggressive</em> and <em>self-defeating</em> humour, which are considered maladaptive. The second measure, the Thinking and Feeling Questionnaire (TFQ), looks at cognitive and affective empathy, as well as sympathy. Cognitive empathy can be thought of as intellectually understanding the perspective of another person, whereas affective empathy is the ability to feel congruent emotions in response to the conditions of others.</p>



<p>Analyses found that self-enhancing humour, which is used to relieve tension, boost mood, and overcome hardship, was the only style identified to be positively correlated with both types of empathy and sympathy. Kids who displayed this style, the authors suggest, are able to take on the perspective of their audience, understand their emotions, and sympathise with them.</p>



<p>The affiliative humour style, which primarily takes the form of humour to facilitate social interaction by amusing others, was found to positively correlate with just cognitive empathy, but not affective empathy or sympathy. This may reflect varying levels of cognitive development in this age group — it may be that the ability to sympathise had not yet fully developed in the children using this humour style.</p>



<p>As might be expected, aggressive humour was negatively correlated with measures of both affective empathy and sympathy, consistent with previous research on adults. Children who score low on these measures may be unable to appreciate the views and emotions of the audience, and thus struggle to adjust humour accordingly. Interestingly, displaying this maladaptive type of humour may limit the opportunities children have to socialise, giving them less of a chance to develop more adaptive humour styles.</p>



<p>Standing somewhat alone amongst the four styles, self-deprecating humour was not correlated with either measure of empathy. This may be due to the fact that this style focuses inward, rather than being concerned with the emotions and situations of others, or indeed what they’ll find funny. However, the authors note that some children in this age range may be unable to self-report on this style, as they don’t fully grasp what self-deprecating humour encompasses.</p>



<p>Humour styles also varied significantly between genders: boys were more likely to report using aggressive humour styles than girls, and were less likely to score highly in affective empathy. The exact reasons for these gender differences weren’t probed in this study.</p>



<p>These patterns of relationship between humour styles, empathy, and sympathy are a wonderful illustration of the complexity of social interactions at this age. More developed empathy and sympathy seem to give rise to self-enhancing humour styles, which are in turn associated with a number of benefits, such as social intimacy, high self-esteem, and lower levels of depression and anxiety. As such, children who have fully developed their empathy and sympathy skills may have more positive social interactions. In much the same way, less development in these domains may lead to maladaptive humour styles, which could alienate the children using these styles from their peers, and further inhibit their empathetic and sympathetic development. It’s possible that identifying such humour patterns and providing support for empathetic and/or sympathetic growth in children who often use them, therefore, may help them on their way to more adaptive social strategies.</p>

<blockquote><p>The conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Medicinal plants<br />
</strong>In recent years, an increasing interest in medicinal plants and a growing therapeutic use of phytochemicals has occurred. Medicinal plants are applied for the production of phytopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals and their use is growing rapidly throughout the world: demand for wild resources has increased by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-016-0108-7">8–15 % per year in Europe, North America, and Asia in recent decades</a>. That is why the problem of the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable harvest<br />
</strong>Bulgaria is rich in medicinal and aromatic plant resources but recently they are being harvested in increasing volumes, largely from wild populations. As a result, many of these plants are now endangered species. The need of sustainable use of these valuable resources in Bulgaria resulted in a <a href="http://sf.mon.bg/?go=projects&amp;p=detail&amp;projectsId=49&amp;lang=en">project</a> supported by the EU and the Bulgarian government and dedicated to Sustainable utilization of bio resources and waste from medicinal and aromatic plants for innovative bioactive products. It is an interdisciplinary project coordinated by the <a href="http://srv.orgchm.bas.bg/EN/index_en.html">Institute of Organic Chemistry with Centre of Phytochemistry</a> (IOCCP) at the <a href="https://www.bas.bg/?lang=en">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> and involves five more Bulgarian research institutions.</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12526 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/sideritis-cult-140x110.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="110" />Natural reserves and wild nurseries are good ways to protect the plants and retain their medical efficacy in their natural habitats. However, it is not possible to designate every natural wild plant habitat as a protected area, so cultivation is the alternative. Cultivation under controlled conditions can result in higher yields of active constituents and guarantees production stability. Increased cultivation contributes to substantial decrease in the harvest volume of wild medicinal plants, benefits the recovery of their wild resources, and decreases their prices. In addition, cultivation can increase the income of people in rural communities and thus support the sustainable development of these communities.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable processing<br />
</strong>The processing of medicinal plants for obtaining extracts and active constituents is an important part of their utilization. The increasing environmental concerns over the last decades have motivated the development of sustainable extraction strategies that follow the basic <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html">principles of green chemistry</a>. So an important aim of the abovementioned project is the development of sustainable extraction approaches to obtain various plant extracts with minimum impact on the environment (lower energy consumption, renewable solvents, etc.). Green extraction technologies are able to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances and limit the cost of solvent waste disposal; among them are supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction, all considered sustainable techniques.</p>
<img class="alignright wp-image-12525 size-medium" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
<p><strong>Utilization of wastes<br />
</strong>Industrial processes that utilize medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) generates various kinds of residues like residual biomasses from distillation of aromatic plant and non-utilized parts of medicinal plant. The extraction residue is often treated as a waste to dumping. However residual biomasses should not be considered as waste as these can actually be recycled. These biomasses are suitable for isolation of phytochemicals like phenolics-antioxidants and converted into value added products. A good example of such utilization is the large amount of wastes generated by the production of the famous Bulgarian rose oil. One of the partner in our project, the Agrobioinstitute (Sofia) developed a technological scheme for combined utilization of waste rose biomass, aimed at the extraction of polyphenol substances and subsequent fractional extraction of polysaccharides. An additional advantage of this integrated approach is that it could be further combined with other methods and applied to other essential oil plant wastes. Valorizing by-products from the residual biomass from medicinal and aromatic plants is one of the potential ways to achieve a sustainable economy.</p>
<p><strong>A success story<br />
</strong>A success story is the one of a very popular medicinal plant, Mountain tea <em>Sideritis scardica</em>, endemic to the Balkan Peninsula. It is used for wound and burn healing, treatment of gastric ulcer, the common cold and mucous membrane inflammation. In the 1990’s, the collection of wild-growing <em>Sideritis scardica </em>became very extensive: it was in danger of extinction and was included in the Red Book list of Bulgaria. To respond to the demand of the consumers, our colleagues with the Institute of Botany developed a very productive cultivar and cultivation was gradually developing and is now very popular in rural communities with appropriate climatic and environmental conditions. We chemists studied the sustainable extraction methods and suggested the most appropriate approaches for this plant. And now, in the frame of our big project, we have recently filed a patent for a cosmeceutical based on this plant extract.</p>

The cultivation, processing and trade of high-value medicinal and aromatic plants could contribute to social equity, environmental conservation and economic prosperity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whirling-maple-seeds-inspired-tiny-flying-sensors-microfliers">Whirling maple seeds inspired these tiny flying sensors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like helicoptering maple seeds, tiny new fliers whirl gracefully as they glide.</p>



<p>The miniature aircraft, which can be made as small as a grain of sand, could be dispersed by air over long distances. Scientists envision that these microfliers, when equipped with wee sensors for measuring environmental conditions, could monitor pH, test for heavy metals or assess hazards like chemical spills, for example. The devices could also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-sunlight-powered-aircraft-could-soar-beyond-airplanes-reach">track conditions in the atmosphere</a> while aloft (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The maple tree–lined streets north of Chicago, where materials scientist John Rogers lives, served as inspiration for the new microfliers. But Rogers, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and colleagues went smaller-than-life when designing their fleet. Some of the whirligigs are just half a millimeter across, the team reports in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em>. The researchers used computer simulations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y">to help select the microflier shapes best for smooth flight</a>, designing rotors of various sizes and with different numbers and shapes of blades.</p>



<p>As with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-maple-fruits-fall">maples’ seed-copters and those of other plants</a>, the fliers’ blades induce spinning motions that help stabilize flight (<em>SN: 6/11/09</em>). The designs also decrease the speed at which the microfliers fall, giving them more time to disperse. One flier fell at about 28 centimeters per second, less than half the speed of natural whirligigs from various plants.</p>



<p>In the future, the researchers plan to make biodegradable versions of the fliers, so that the objects could be scattered without defiling the environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genetics-how-polynesia-settled-migration-islands-pacific-ocean">DNA offers a new look at how Polynesia was settled</a></h4>

              
                <p>Polynesian voyagers settled islands across a vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean within about 500 years, leaving a genetic trail of the routes that the travelers took, scientists say.</p>



<p>Comparisons of present-day Polynesians’ DNA indicate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03902-8">sea journeys launched from Samoa</a> in western Polynesia headed south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled farther east to a string of small islands called the Tuamotus fanned out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers on Polynesia’s eastern edge. On each of those islands, the Tuamotu travelers built massive stone statues like the ones Easter Island is famed for.</p>



<p>That’s the scenario sketched out in a new study in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em> by Stanford University computational biologist Alexander Ioannidis, population geneticist Andrés Moreno-Estrada of the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico, and their colleagues.</p>



<p>The new analysis generally aligns with archaeological estimates of human migrations across eastern Polynesia from roughly 900 to 1250. And the study offers an unprecedented look at settlement pathways that zigged and zagged over a distance of more than 5,000 kilometers, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“The colonization of eastern Polynesia was a remarkable event in which a vast area, some one-third of the planet, became inhabited by humans in … a relatively short period of time,” says archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University in New York, who wasn’t involved in the new research.</p>



<p>Improved radiocarbon dating techniques applied to remains of short-lived plant species unearthed at archaeological sites are also producing a chronology of Polynesian colonization close to that proposed in the genetic study, Lipo says.</p>



<p>In the new investigation, researchers identified DNA segments of exclusively Polynesian origin in 430 present-day individuals from 21 Pacific island populations. Island-specific genetic fingerprints enabled the scientists to reconstruct settlement paths, based on increases in rare gene variants that must have resulted from a small group moving from one island to another and giving rise to a new, larger population with novel DNA twists. Comparisons of shared Polynesian ancestry between pairs of individuals on different islands were used to estimate when settlements occurred.</p>



<p>In an intriguing twist, the DNA evidence “is consistent with the [statue] carving tradition arising once in a single point of common origin, likely the Tuamotu islands,” Moreno-Estrada says. Polynesian ancestry on all the islands with massive statues traces back to the one island in the Tuamotus where the researchers were able to obtain Indigenous peoples’ DNA.</p>



<p>The Tuamotus include nearly 80 islands situated between Tahiti to the west and other islands to the north and east where settlers carved statues. The latter outposts consist of the Marquesas Islands, Mangareva and Rapa Nui. Another late-settled island where inhabitants carved statues, Raivavae, lies southwest of the Tuamotus.</p>



<p>Settlers reached the island of Mataiva in the northern Tuamotus by about 1110, the researchers suggest. Statue makers navigated northward and eastward from Mataiva or perhaps other Tuamotu islands to as far east as Rapa Nui — eventually curving back west before arriving at Raivavae — around the same time as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-americans-may-have-traveled-polynesia-800-years-ago">an earlier DNA study suggests eastern Polynesians mated with South Americans</a> (<em>SN: 7/8/20</em>). (It’s not clear whether South Americans crossed the ocean to Polynesia or Polynesians traveled to South America and then returned.)</p>

<h3>Pacific trek</h3>



<p>Caption: An analysis of 430 present-day individuals is shedding new light on the timings and routes of early Polynesians’ migrations. Modern DNA indicates that voyagers left Samoa and went south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled to the Tuamotu Islands, located just east of Tahiti, spread out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers. </p>

<p>Ioannidis and colleagues’ conclusions generally support prior scenarios of Polynesia’s settlement, but some disparities exist between their genetic evidence and earlier archaeological and linguistic findings, writes archaeologist Patrick Kirch of the University of Hawaii at Manoa in a commentary published with the new study.</p>



<p>For instance, the new DNA analysis overlooks extensive contacts that occurred across eastern Polynesian in its early settlement stages, Kirch says. Analyses of closely related eastern Polynesian language dialects and discoveries of stone tools that were transported from one island to another point to substantial travels and trading throughout the region during that time.</p>



<p>Kirch, who has previously suggested that these long-distance contacts in eastern Polynesian influenced stone carving traditions, calls the new proposal that people with a shared ancestry brought stone carving to Rapa Nui and other islands “a provocative hypothesis.”</p>



<p>And there’s still no answer to one major question regarding the settlement of the islands, says molecular anthropologist Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who didn’t participate in the new research. No current line of evidence can resolve the mystery of why, after spending nearly 2,000 years on Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, Polynesians began voyaging thousands of kilometers eastward in search of new lands.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The boundaries of personal space aren’t set in stone. They even vary widely from person to person, between cultures, and between environments (for example, we might give strangers a wide berth on the pavement, yet end up shoulder to shoulder on trains). And though it may not feel like it on public transport, personal space is a consideration in everything from the design of buildings to logistics for large events.</p>



<p>In 2020, Covid brought a whole new element to the table in terms of our comfort levels around other people. Maintaining a physical distance was one of the few things we could do for many months to limit the risk of infection, so for many of us, the personal space boundaries we were used to suddenly became no-gos.</p>



<p>This change is fantastically illustrated by a new preprint from Daphne Halt and team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The researchers believe that our personal space preferences not only tell us about the psychological effects of the pandemic, but may be of use as an indicator of progress towards regaining normality.</p>



<span id="more-43908"></span>



<p>To examine how the pandemic has affected people’s personal space preferences, they conducted a small study with 12 participants who had also completed pre-pandemic personal space investigations at the lab.</p>



<p>The team collected data on the size of participants’ personal spaces using the Stop Distance Procedure (SDP) — a task which measures the distance at which participants become uncomfortable with an approaching person, as well as where they become uncomfortable approaching the other party. This task was performed both typically (in a space with another person) and using virtual reality. The distance data collected during the pandemic was then compared to existing pre-pandemic data from each of the participants. Data on beliefs and experiences during the pandemic were also collected.</p>



<p>Results showed that, on average, the distances participants preferred to keep during the pandemic were significantly greater than their pre-pandemic personal boundaries, both in reality and virtually. Participants who showed a greater increase also tended to perceive the risk of infection as higher. Surprisingly, though, there was no relationship between this increase in distance and <em>actual</em> infection risk (as defined by the number of positive cases in the town in which the participant lived). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors say that the increase in people’s boundaries even in virtual reality, where there was no infection risk, may be indicative of changes to neural representations of the &#8220;safety zone&#8221; around our bodies, as well as sensorimotor circuits in the brain involved in maintaining our safety. These ideas, however, will need further investigation to verify. There’s also a possibility that this increase may persist beyond the pandemic; but, it’s just as possible that our need for more space will revert to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over. The scale at which social distance measures were applied is unprecedented, and as such, it’s difficult to make predictions about what future average personal space boundaries may look like, respective to pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>Future research will be instrumental in addressing the above, as well as verifying that this phenomenon holds within a larger sample size. Cross cultural analyses may also be useful, though differences in Covid guidelines are likely to make cross-borders comparisons particularly difficult. Even so, this finding will be particularly interesting to those in fields that require estimations of personal space, and could potentially provide a basis for the development of tools to assess worry about infection in the general population.</p>

                <p>In the United States, booster shots of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine won’t be widely available to the general public starting this week. Instead, only certain groups will have access to a third dose of the vaccine: people 65 years and older, individuals 18 and older who are at high risk of severe COVID-19, and those whose jobs put them at high risk of getting infected.</p>



<p>These new guidelines come after nearly a week of intense debate and last-minute seesawing over who should be eligible for an extra dose.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 22 granted an emergency use authorization that opened the door for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-booster-dose-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-certain-populations?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boosters</a> for these individuals, following the unanimous recommendation on September 17 by its panel of expert advisers.</p>



<p>But on September 23, an advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rejected boosters for those who might be exposed to the coronavirus on the job. Panelists argued that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-09-22-23.html">vaccine still works extremely well</a> and there&#8217;s no evidence of waning protection against hospitalization in this group. Still, the panel did vote that the older age group and individuals 50 to 64 years old who have health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity, that put them at high risk of severe disease should get a booster dose.</p>





<p>For those ages 18 to 64 with underlying conditions, their individual risk and benefit should factor into booster decisions, the CDC panel said.</p>



<p>Hours later, CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0924-booster-recommendations-.html">tweaked the guidelines</a> to once again include people whose jobs put them at risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That group includes essential workers like health care professionals, people who live in group settings such as homeless shelters and anyone whose job brings them within six feet of others. Like with younger people with underlying conditions, individual risk and benefit should be weighed. “In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good,” Walensky said in a Sept. 24 statement.</p>



<p>The guidance applies only to people who received the Pfizer vaccine. Decisions on boosters for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s jabs — the other two COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States — still lie ahead.</p>



<p>Getting unvaccinated people vaccinated will still have the biggest impact on the pandemic, as well as following other public health measures like wearing masks, Katherine Poehling, a pediatrician at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., said at the Sept. 23 CDC meeting. Two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are still highly effective for most people, she noted, even as some groups become eligible for a booster shot.</p>



<p>Both agencies&#8217; actions are more limited in scope than what the Biden administration proposed in August. Officials had announced plans to offer a third dose of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine to the general public at least six months after vaccination starting September 20, pending an OK from the FDA.</p>

<p>Since officials unveiled that plan, it’s been widely debated. Some researchers — including Pfizer scientists — argue that because the vaccine’s protection against infections is waning, that could foreshadow a possible dip in protection against severe disease too. So the time to bolster everyone’s protection with a third dose is now, these researchers say. But others disagree, contending that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02046-8/fulltext">it’s more important to focus on getting doses to unvaccinated people first</a>, and that many younger, healthy vaccinated people remain well-protected against severe disease and death after just two doses.</p>



<p>Third doses are already authorized for moderately to severely immunocompromised people who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">may not develop good protection from the initial shots</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). The case for another dose was obvious for that group, says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland who wasn’t involved with the FDA panel. The data were “clear as day that the third dose was important” and could help boost the levels of protective antibodies in some patients.</p>



<p>But moving forward for the general population requires more specialized consideration, Slifka notes. “I think part of it comes down to what’s our level of risk tolerance.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the key questions that influenced the FDA panel’s recommendation.</p>



<h4>Is vaccine effectiveness starting to wane?</h4>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are still largely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinatedhttps:/www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">keeping people out of the hospital</a> in the United States, studies show (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). Even as infections among vaccinated people go up, protection against hospitalization and death remains high, CDC epidemiologist Sara Oliver said at the September 17 meeting.</p>



<p>That’s true for all three vaccines — developed by Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J — available in the United States even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. Before delta dominated in the country, estimates of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults 18 and older ranged from 84 to 97 percent. That’s compared with 75 to 95 percent effectiveness after the variant took over, Oliver said. Effectiveness against infection, on the other hand, has dipped from 72 to 97 percent before delta to around 40 to 84 percent. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, data from Israel — the first country to vaccinate the majority of its population against COVID-19 — hint that over time Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine becomes less effective at preventing severe disease, particularly in people age 60 and older. That trend spurred public health officials there to begin offering a booster dose to that age group July 30 amid a spike in cases.</p>



<p>That third dose seems to have helped. People age 60 and older who didn’t receive a booster were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255">11 times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus</a> and nearly 20 times as likely to develop severe disease compared with those who got a third dose at least 12 days earlier, researchers reported September 15 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Preliminary data presented at the September 17 meeting suggest that the same trend may occur in people ages 40 to 59.</p>



<p>The booster brings vaccine efficacy back up to levels seen before delta came on the scene, Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, told the FDA panel. “It’s like a fresh vaccine.”</p>



<p>It’s less clear, however, that protection against the worst of COVID-19 wanes in younger people, too, contributing to the FDA panel’s recommendation for boosters for those age 65 and older. But that should become clearer in the coming months, as researchers continue to monitor the situation.</p>



<p>In Israel, everyone over age 12 became eligible on August 29 for a third shot at least five months after a second dose. That decision was made because officials wanted to control the latest surge in cases, and limiting transmission would have been difficult without vaccinating everyone eligible, Alroy-Preis said.</p>



<p>Estimates suggest that transmission in Israel is indeed slowing. By one measure, infected people tend to pass the virus on to fewer than one other person, meaning the outbreak could begin to fizzle out. While hospitalizations and severe cases have stabilized since people began receiving boosters, however, the overall number of COVID-19 cases remains high.</p>



<p>That disparity may exist because the country opened schools on September 1 and many Israelis have gathered in holiday celebrations, Alroy-Preis said. But once things settle down, officials will likely have a better sense of where things stand. “We feel the booster effect, but we are not over the fourth wave yet,” she said.</p>





<h4>How safe is it to give people a third dose?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Many experts on the FDA panel expressed concerns about the possibility of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis'">heart inflammation, a condition called myocarditis</a>, that has been linked to mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer’s, particularly in young males (<em>SN: 6/1/21</em>). Most cases are mild and are easily treated.</p>



<p>Experts have determined that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent severe disease outweigh the risk of myocarditis. But most panelists were reluctant to come to the same conclusion for a booster dose for younger age groups without more data.</p>



<p>Since boosters started rolling out in Israel, officials so far have documented only one case of myocarditis out of 2 million doses — in a male in his thirties. However, not enough time has passed to know for sure: Most younger people received a third dose within the last two weeks. Officials are actively monitoring for myocarditis reports, Alroy-Preis said. In Pfizer’s clinical trial testing a third dose, none of the more than 300 participants developed myocarditis.</p>



<p>But that data did little to alleviate the concerns of the FDA panel. Not only is the picture from Israel not yet certain, but some panelists were also concerned that the Pfizer trial included too few people.</p>



<p>More than a million third doses have been given in the United States, noted Hayley Gans, an infectious disease pediatrician at Stanford University, at the meeting. So there could be a larger pool of safety data to consider. But without that data available, it feels like trying to make a decision without all the pieces, Gans said. Oliver, the CDC epidemiologist, said that the data would probably be released in the coming days.</p>



<p>Aside from the uncertainty surrounding myocarditis, a third dose appears safe. Side effects like pain at the injection site, fever and chills were mostly mild and occurred at similar rates as after a second dose.</p>



<h4>How long might the boost in immunity last?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure, but increasing the time between doses does traditionally prompt longer-lasting vaccine protection, Slifka says. While that’s not always the case, “I doubt [any COVID-19 booster] will be shorter-lived than what we have,” in terms of immunity, he says. “It’s either going to be equal to or longer” than at least six months. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving people a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine does boost <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468">antibodies to levels that surpass those seen after a second dose</a>, researchers reported September 15 in a separate study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>But, crucially, researchers don’t yet know what level of antibodies in the blood actually gives a person sufficient protection against the coronavirus in the first place. That would be helpful to pinpoint whether immunity, either after two or three doses, might have waned, James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said during the FDA panel’s discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immunologist Michael Kurilla agreed. “We just can’t simply be in a position where we would just be vaccinating people every time we think there’s a problem,” so researchers need to get a better handle on how to measure protection, said Kurilla, of the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in Bethesda, Md.&nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>What’s more, our immune systems have the tools to remember the coronavirus after vaccination, which should prevent severe disease, Kurilla noted. And just two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine seem to spark long-lived immune memory — including cells that make antibodies as well as other immune cells that coordinate the immune response or kill infected cells — so the body can rapidly ramp up defenses if the coronavirus were to invade.</p>



<p>Booster shots could be useful to fortify weak immune memory, giving people better protection in the future. But given that many people already have developed that strong, long-lived immune memory, it’s unclear why they would even need a third jab right now, Kurilla said.</p>



<p>Our immune systems don’t work as well as we age, however. So older people may end up needing those boosters more than younger people.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How would boosters affect the pandemic more broadly?</h4>



<p>Researchers on the FDA panel were divided on the answer to that question.</p>



<p>The effects of a third dose on controlling COVID-19 cases and spread in the United States would probably be minimal, some said. That’s partly because in this country, virus transmission is largely driven by high numbers of unvaccinated people, said Eric Rubin, a microbiologist and infectious disease physician at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. So, giving boosters to vaccinated people could have little impact on spread overall.</p>



<p>Others, including Gans, said that to answer the question, they would like to see more data on the booster’s ability to curb transmission. If that data did show that fewer people are getting infected by people who have had three shots, then giving some people, such as parents or teachers, a vaccine booster to better prevent infection and spread might help protect kids who are too young to be vaccinated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, many experts around the world emphasize that to have the most impact on the pandemic, efforts should be focused on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">getting vaccines to the unvaccinated</a>, not boosters to the vaccinated (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). In a push for vaccine equity, the World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters until the end of the year. The vast majority of vaccine doses have made it into arms in high-income countries, while most people in low-income countries still lack protection, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---8-september-2021">September 8 news briefing</a>. “We have been calling for vaccine equity from the beginning, not after the richest countries have been taken care of.”</p>





<h4>What about boosters for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines?</h4>



<p>Most of the focus on boosters has centered on Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, in part because Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to ask for booster approval from the FDA. But millions of U.S. residents have received vaccines developed by Moderna or J&amp;J. So what do we know about potential boosters for those vaccines?</p>



<p>For now, Moderna’s vaccine appears to be outperforming Pfizer’s, meaning that boosters might be less crucial (although a third dose <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-submission-initial-data-us-fda-its-covid-19">does raise antibody levels</a>, even against coronavirus variants, the company says). When it comes to hospitalizations, Moderna’s shot was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">93 percent effective at keeping people out of the hospital as of August 15</a>, researchers reported September 17 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. That’s compared with an estimated 88 percent effectiveness for Pfizer’s vaccine.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why there might be differences in effectiveness between the two vaccines, since both rely on the same mRNA technology. But it’s possible that the longer interval between first and second doses — four weeks for Moderna’s compared with three weeks for Pfizer’s — may help people develop a longer-lasting immune response, Slifka says. Plus, Moderna’s vaccine includes a higher dose than Pfizer’s does, which could also help. But it&#8217;s possible those differences will disappear over time as researchers collect more data, he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fewer people have received J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine than the mRNA vaccines, so there’s less information available on that shot. As of August 15, a single dose was around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">71 percent effective at preventing hospitalization</a>, researchers reported in that same September 17 study. That’s close to the nearly 75 percent efficacy against severe disease reported in late-stage clinical trials. And there’s <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s">no evidence that protection wanes over time</a>, the company said in a September 21 news release.</p>



<p>But a second dose given two months after the first can <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262569v1">increase antibody levels and provide even better protection</a>, J&amp;J also announced. In clinical trials, that second shot had an efficacy of 94 percent against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States, on par with the mRNA vaccines.</p>



<p>Waiting six months to give the second dose helped boost antibody levels even more, the company said. While the two-month-interval raised antibodies four to six times as high as after the first dose, six months between doses resulted in levels 12 times as high as a month after that second shot. And more antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">could mean more protection</a> against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Booster data for these other shots <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/19/fauci-says-data-moderna-johnson-johnson-boosters-few-weeks-away-fda-review/">are on the docket for the FDA</a> to consider in the future. That could perhaps happen in a few weeks’ time, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on September 19.</p>

<p>Calling your attention to the call for abstracts for the ninth Peer Review Congress published this week. Details are available in this <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2252">Editorial</a>, co-published by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784485">JAMA </a>and the BMJ, and on the <a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/">Congress website.&nbsp;</a> You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdnUH7Ekuw4">watch </a>the virtual symposium if you want to hear specifics from organizers of the Congress.</p>



<p>Every four year since 1989, the Peer Review Congress has brought together researchers, journal editors and all those who participate in the reporting and publication of scientific research, in order to put their own processes under scrutiny. The meetings have helped stimulate research into peer review and scientific publication &mdash; including studies of bias, reporting standards, prospective registration and many more topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ninth Peer Review Congress will be held in September 2022 and the website will open for abstracts submissions on December 1, 2021.&nbsp;<strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>deadline for abstract submissions will be January 31, 2022.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Congress was originally anchored by medical journals&ndash;the JAMA network, the BMJ and the Meta-Research Innovation Center (METRICS) at Stanford are its organizers and planners&ndash;but it now embraces a wide range of disciplines. Sharing findings and experimentation across disciplinary boundaries is particularly important. The audience of this meeting is unique and includes researchers, editors, funders, information innovators, policymakers, ethicists, journalists and more.</p>



<p>For this next congress, I have the honor to be part of an amazing&nbsp;<a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/organizers-and-advisory-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advisory Board&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;who will work with the organizers to shape the conference program. We look forward to receiving abstracts and helping to assemble a stimulating program of evidence-based discussions to improve the quality, effectiveness and fairness of peer review.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/luis-miramontes-chemistry-birth-control-pill-ingredient-sexual-revolution">Luis Miramontes helped enable the sexual revolution. Why isn’t he better known?</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Mexican scientist Luis Miramontes signed his lab notebook on October 15, 1951, he didn’t know he was documenting history.</p>



<p>That day, he made a new molecule — norethindrone. Derived from the wild Mexican yam that locals call <em>barbasco</em>, norethindrone became <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-birth-control-pill-ready-after-ten-years">one of the first active ingredients in birth control pills</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birth-control-research-moving-beyond-pill">“The pill”</a> gave women control over when they had children and let men and women enjoy sex without the chance of reproduction, thus ushering in seismic social change.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ notebook page has been immortalized in books and articles by his former supervisor, Carl Djerassi, as well as reporters. Yet compared with Djerassi and others who contributed to the pill, Miramontes attained little recognition, says Gabriela Soto Laveaga, a historian of science at Harvard University and author of <em>Jungle Laboratories: Mexican Peasants, National Projects, and the Making of the Pill</em>. “It isn’t until recently that Miramontes has even been spoken about.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luis Ernesto Miramontes Cárdenas was born in 1925, in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. He grew up surrounded by strong female role models, including his aunt María Dolores Cárdenas Aréchiga, a onetime major in Pancho Villa’s army who later joined the army of teachers bringing education to the remotest corners of Mexico. Young Miramontes decided on a career in science. By the late 1940s, he was studying chemical engineering in Mexico City.</p>



<p>It was a good time and place to be a skilled molecule maker. The Mexican company Syntex was blowing away global competition at producing low-cost hormones to treat diseases. The reason was the Mexican yam, <em>Dioscorea mexicana</em>, which contained large quantities of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cortisone-made-yams">a precursor that could be used to make several hormones</a>. In 1949, Miramontes became one of a group of researchers assigned to Syntex projects as part of an agreement with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM. Djerassi, an Austrian-born American chemist, “liked the way I worked,” Miramontes said in a 2004 interview. “If he wanted something to turn out well, or to be verified, he’d give me the job.”</p>





<p>Progesterone was just such a challenge. Doctors used it to prevent certain types of miscarriages, among other things, but it had to be injected to work. Djerassi and Syntex director George Rosenkranz wanted a progesterone pill. Following leads from other scientists, Syntex made a modified progesterone derived from the yam, one designed to survive the digestive tract and have more biological activity than progesterone. That was norethindrone. Miramontes figured out the last step in its recipe, adding a crucial carbon-carbon triple bond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, experts and activists made the connection between progesterone and birth control, because progesterone prevents ovulation during pregnancy. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-birth-control-pill-ready-after-ten-years">This paved the way for norethindrone to be used in contraception</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="258" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2.png" alt="chemical structures of norethindrone and norethynodrel" class="wp-image-3103831" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2-330x125.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103831">After Luis Miramontes developed norethindrone (left), chemists at a rival company reported norethynodrel (right), a similar compound chosen for use in the first birth control pill.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103831">PubChem</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, it didn’t end up in the first pill. A year after Syntex reported norethindrone, chemists at rival firm Searle, an American company, reported their own compound, norethynodrel. It differed from norethindrone by the position of just one carbon-carbon double bond, and adding stomach acid converted it to norethindrone. Gregory Pincus, a codeveloper of the first pill, chose Searle’s compound. But norethindrone had a longer-lasting impact. Searle’s compound is no longer marketed. In 2018, norethindrone was still the 138th most prescribed drug in the United States.</p>



<p>Why, then, did Miramontes remain an obscure figure? He was a student at a time when science was especially hierarchical. And the fact that Searle beat Syntex to market cut Mexico — and Miramontes — out of the narrative. Perhaps renown was not Miramontes’ preference. His son Octavio Miramontes Vidal says: “My father was a quiet individual. He was not someone who was seeking fame.” In contrast, Djerassi “did not aspire to modesty,” according to an obituary.</p>

<p>Miramontes Vidal says that his father was bilingual, but Miramontes didn’t choose to write his story in English. Others did: Pincus mentioned Syntex in his book’s acknowledgements, but not its chemists. Djerassi credited Miramontes in his works, but called Miramontes “a young Mexican chemist” when he himself was less than two years older. “It’s about who controls the narrative, and the person who controls the narrative of the invention of the pill in the United States in many ways becomes Djerassi,” says Soto Laveaga.</p>



<p>Miramontes ended up accepting a director position at Searle to earn more money to support his growing family; he and his wife had 10 children. From there, the university seemed to close its doors, says his son Miramontes Vidal, who is a physicist at UNAM. Despite completing all requirements, Miramontes was never awarded a Ph.D. He was not a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences, which was cofounded by one of his mentors at UNAM.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ parish priest threatened his wife with excommunication, Miramontes Vidal says — the Catholic Church’s influence in 1960s Mexico can’t be overstated. Miramontes perhaps hinted at this when he wrote that the pill “generated profound, serious moral questions in some sectors of society, and obtuse, reactionary attitudes in others.”</p>

<p>Times changed. In the 1980s, Miramontes won awards from Mexican state governments and the Mexican Chemical Society. In 2010, the president of the Mexican Academy of Sciences ranked Miramontes’ work as one of Mexico’s three top scientific contributions. But the damage had been done. Miramontes Vidal says that when his father passed away in 2004, newspapers didn’t know who he was. Word of his death traveled so slowly that it took the American Chemical Society two years to issue an obituary.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ own writings suggest satisfaction with his legacy. “I consider myself lucky,” he wrote in 2001, “because the researcher, in their zeal to discover the truth at the outset of their work, on many occasions doesn’t realize what they will find.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/667224466/0/oupblogpsychology/">Eradicating ableism with disability-positive K-12 education</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/eradicating-ableism-with-disability-positive-k-12-education/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/markus-spiske-AXc2uwl4Cik-unsplashedit-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>More than half a century ago, powerful civil rights laws brought disabled children into American school systems, breaking down the physical barriers that held these young people at the margins of society. But attitudes towards disability as a devalued limitation persisted, holding social and cultural barriers between disabled and nondisabled people firmly in place. There is, however, an opportunity to use the power of education and learning to reimagine how we design the world.</p><p>In 1970, United States public schools educated only <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://sites.ed.gov/idea/IDEA-History#content">one in five students with disabilities</a>, and most states had laws on the books denying children with both physical and developmental disabilities access to mainstream schooling. In 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) to support states and localities in the public education of students with disabilities. When it was reauthorized in 1990, EHA was renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). As a millennial born in 1984, IDEA afforded me, a blind kindergartener, the right to attend my local public school. I was born with a degenerative eye condition that meant I would have night blindness my whole life, and gradually lose my daytime vision as well.</p><p>By 2016, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/osep/2018/parts-b-c/40th-arc-for-idea.pdf">95% of children 6-21</a> who were eligible for services under IDEA were spending at least some part of each school day in a mainstream classroom. This was a huge leap forward but was happening in the absence of a major culture shift—even though more and more disabled children were joining classrooms, disability was absent from the curriculum. For instance, no one—not my parents, my teachers, my classmates, or myself—referred to me as “blind.” We often referred to my “eye problem,” or said that, “I couldn’t see in the dark.” There was no vocabulary to describe my sense of difference, though it was deeply felt.</p><p>In school, I did wear glasses, but none of the trappings of blindness—the white cane, the Braille business cards—those would come later. Still, I was the source of relentless bullying. I recall dreading mundane things like accidentally dropping my pencil on the ground, as I’d have to kneel down, in a cold sweat of shame, as the boys in the class taunted me, calling me “blindy” as I traced my fingers across the floor to locate my fallen writing implement. This was all because none of us knew better—because, for centuries, disabled children were bundled away and corralled inside institutions, while nondisabled children were taught to fear and underestimate them. These deeply-engrained fears of disability still exist in the present day and are acted upon in ways that harm disabled children.</p><p>Though there are only 10 US studies linking disability to bullying in school, according to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pacer.org/bullying/info/students-with-disabilities/#maincontent">one study</a> from 2009, disabled children were two to three times more likely to experience bullying than their nondisabled peers. A more recent 2019 analysis from the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pacer.org/bullying/info/stats.asp#maincontent">National Center for Educational Statistics   </a> found that, alongside physical appearance, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion, disability was among the most common reason for bullying reported by students. Negative outcomes of bullying include lower performance in school, greater absenteeism, and lower graduation rates, among others.</p><p>This data comes as no surprise to me, as it reflects my own childhood. And this is how schools perpetuated a culture of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.accessliving.org/newsroom/blog/ableism-101/">ableism</a>—and it took powerful civil rights laws to achieve the simple step of giving disabled children access to the same educational opportunities as their nondisabled peers.</p><p>Thankfully, for a new generation of disabled students, this reality is changing, and we can begin to see a world remade by people who will grow up immersed in disability-positive education.</p><p>Organizations like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://disabilityequalityeducation.org/#content">Disability Equality and Education</a> in Pennsylvania are developing disability-positive curricula that teach children about various forms of disability, as well as how to honor and respect the differences that make us all whole and human. Disabled authors are publishing children’s books like <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.akpress.org/we-move-together.html">We Move Together</a></em> and <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670588/rolling-warrior-by-judith-heumann/">Rolling Warrior</a></em><em> </em>that further reinforce these ideas. Films like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.netflix.com/title/81001496">Crip Camp</a> are being used in schools to tell stories of the disability civil rights movement. These are the narratives that I had to seek out in my adult life, that will no longer be invisible for the next generation of disabled youth.</p><p>And this is just the beginning. States, localities, and school boards must demand that disability become part of the K-12 curriculum. Students who, because of IDEA, have the opportunity and the right to learn alongside their nondisabled peers should see themselves in the education they receive. And they shouldn’t be alone in these discoveries—nondisabled children should be right there with them, building disability consciousness and finding creative ways to work together to ensure everyone is included in every aspect of life. If this becomes the foundation, a child who grows into an architect is less likely to forget to build that ramp and make it beautiful; a high school student who becomes a doctor is more likely to show compassion and provide accommodation to a disabled patient; and a nondisabled government leader is more likely to consider disability issues when designing public policies. Even after the harms of bullying and the loneliness of exclusion, I believe this new world is possible because knowledge is a powerful tool to repair our entrenched fear of otherness.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Markus Spiske</a> on Unsplash</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/667224466/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/667224466/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f09%2fmarkus-spiske-AXc2uwl4Cik-unsplashedit-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/the-census-and-entitled-resentment/">The Census and entitled resentment</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-climate-change-education-needs-more-empathy/">Why climate change education needs more empathy</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-quantum-spin-ice-fine-structure-constant">One of nature’s key constants is much larger in a quantum material</a></h4>

              
                <p>A crucial number that rules the universe goes big in a strange quantum material.</p>



<p>The fine-structure constant is about 10 times its normal value in a type of material called quantum spin ice, physicists calculate in the Sept. 10 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. The new calculation hints that quantum spin ice could give a glimpse at physics within an alternate universe where the constant is much larger.</p>



<p>With an influence that permeates physics and chemistry, the fine-structure constant sets the strength of interactions between electrically charged particles. Its value, about 1/137, consternates physicists because they can’t explain why it has that value, even though it is necessary for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">complex chemistry</a> that is the basis of life (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>If the fine-structure constant throughout the cosmos were as large as the one in quantum spin ices, “the periodic table would only have 10 elements,” says theoretical physicist Christopher Laumann of Boston University. “And it probably would be hard to make people; there wouldn’t be enough richness to chemistry.”</p>





<p>Quantum spin ices are a class of substances in which particles can’t agree. The materials are made up of particles with spin, a quantum version of angular momentum, which makes them magnetic. In a normal material, particles would come to a consensus below a certain temperature, with the magnetic poles lining up in either the same direction or in alternating directions. But in quantum spin ices, the particles are arranged in such a way that the magnetic poles, or equivalently the spins, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetricity-behaves-electricity">can’t agree</a> even at a temperature of absolute zero (<em>SN: 2/13/11</em>).</p>



<p>The impasse occurs because of the materials’ geometry: The particles are located at the corners of an array of pyramids that are connected at the corners. Conflicts between multiple sets of neighbors mean that the closest these particles can get to harmony is arranging themselves so that two spins face out from each pyramid, and two face in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="605" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1.jpg" alt="particles located at the corners of pyramids in quantum spin ices" class="wp-image-3103911" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-430x383.jpg 430w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-506x450.jpg 506w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-209x186.jpg 209w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-652x580.jpg 652w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103911">In quantum spin ices, particles (black dots) are located at the corners of an array of pyramids (red). Normally, the spins of the particles (green arrows) arrange so that two are pointing into the pyramid and two out. If that rule is broken, as illustrated, quasiparticles called spinons (orange and blue) form.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103911">S.D. Pace <em>et al</em>/<em>PRL</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This uneasy truce can give rise to disturbances that behave like particles within the material, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasiparticles-help-physicists-make-sense-world">quasiparticles</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/14</em>). Flip particles’ spins around and you can get what are called spinons, quasiparticles that can move through the material and interact with other spinons in a manner akin to electrons and other charged particles found in the world outside the material. The material re-creates the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the piece of particles physics’ standard model that hashes out how electrically charged particles do their thing. But the specifics, including the fine-structure constant, don’t necessarily match those in the wider universe.</p>



<p>So Laumann and colleagues set out to calculate the fine-structure constant in quantum spin ices for the first time. The team pegged the number at about 1/10, instead of 1/137. What’s more, the researchers found that they could change the value of the fine-structure constant by tweaking the properties of the theoretical material. That could help scientists study the effects of altering the fine-structure constant — a test that’s well out of reach in our own universe, where the fine-structure constant is fixed.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, scientists haven’t yet found a material that definitively qualifies as quantum spin ice. But one much-studied prospect is a group of minerals called pyrochlores, which have magnetic ions, or electrically charged atoms, arranged in the appropriate pyramid configuration. Scientists might also be able to study the materials using a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computer</a> or another quantum device designed to simulate quantum spin ices (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>If scientists succeed in creating quantum spin ice, the materials could reveal how quantum electrodynamics and the standard model would work in a universe with a much larger fine-structure constant. “That would be the hope,” says condensed matter theorist Shivaji Sondhi of the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the research. “It’s interesting to be able to make a fake standard model … and ask what would happen.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Think about what you were like 10 years ago. How have you changed, in terms of values, life satisfaction and personality? Now picture yourself 10 years in the future. Do you think you’ll be just as different then as you were a decade in the past?</p>



<p>When asked about past vs future change, most people — no matter what their age — report more change over a period of time in the past than they predict for the same period into the future. This &#8220;<a href="https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Quoidbach%20et%20al%202013.pdf">End of History Illusion</a>&#8221; has been well-documented, at least, among <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/">WEIRD</a> populations. Now Brian W. Haas at the University of Georgia, US, and Kazufumi Omura at Yamagata University, Japan, report some cultural differences in susceptibility to it. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211036873">Their paper</a>, in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, also provides some intriguing hints as to why those differences exist.</p>



<span id="more-43903"></span>



<p>In the first of two studies, Haas and Omura analysed existing data on around 5,000 middle-aged Japanese and American participants. Participants answered questions about their life satisfaction, family relationships, work situation, health and financial situation at three different time points: currently, 10 years in the past and predicted for 10 years in the future. The difference between a person’s level of reported past change and predicted future change became their End of History Illusion (EoHI) score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analysis showed that both the American and Japanese groups were susceptible to the illusion in relation to life satisfaction, family relationships and work situation, but the Americans were <em>more</em> susceptible — they reported more past vs predicted future change compared to Japanese participants.</p>



<p>Haas and Omura then looked at the participants’ scores on a measure of self-esteem. They found that among the Americans only, people who had higher self-esteem tended to be more susceptible to the illusion. The Americans also tended to feel more negatively about their pasts than their current state, whereas the Japanese participants tended to report that their pasts were more positive than their current state. The idea of personal growth — of striving for improvement and the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; — is much more popular and important in the US than in Japan. For Americans, viewing their past in a harsher light could help them to feel that they have really grown and improved, supporting their self-esteem.</p>



<p>For their second study, Haas and Omura turned to personality. The pair recruited just over 1,600 online participants from the US and Japan. All completed simple personality tests for themselves as they were currently, but also as they felt they had been 10 years ago and would be in another decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting the earlier pattern of results, Americans tended to report more past than predicted future personality change than the Japanese participants. They also tended to view their past personalities negatively, compared with their present personalities, while those from Japan tended to report their past selves relatively similar to their present selves.</p>



<p>Once again, higher self-esteem scores were linked to more reported past personality change for the Americans. But this time, Haas and Omura also looked at scores on a measure of &#8220;self concept clarity&#8221; — essentially, how well people feel that they know themselves. They found that higher scores on self-concept clarity — which were more common among the Americans — were linked to predictions of less present-to-future personality change. Why should this be?  It might be that Americans are more concerned with feeling that they &#8220;know themselves&#8221;: “Predicting that one’s self will remain stable in the future may aid in preserving confidence in self-knowledge,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Overall, they add: “these findings show that US Americans’ view of their personality development is in part driven by their motivation to believe that they have grown and improved in relation to the past and that they will be stable moving forward in the future.”</p>



<p>There are some limitations to the work. It would have been interesting to also know actual as well as estimated personality and life satisfaction scores over the 20-year period. This type of study would clearly take decades to run, however.</p>



<p>Haas and Omura argue that the work supports the idea that our life stories are central to how we think of ourselves through time — but also shows that different cultures don’t necessarily feature the same life stories. “The EoHI helps to paint a picture that one has changed substantially in the past and is now in a relatively stable good position,” the pair writes. “Although this illusion seems to exist across different cultures, US Americans seem to paint the picture of the EoHI with relatively more vivid colours than Japanese.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-kids-5-11-safe-works-infection">Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and works well for kids ages 5–11</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elementary school–age children may soon be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German biotech company partner BioNTech reported September 20 that a low dose of their <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results">mRNA vaccine is safe for children</a>.</p>



<p>There are hints that the vaccine also protects against the coronavirus. The 10-microgram shots given to kids aged 5- to 11-years-old is a third of the dose given to people 12 and older. Yet after getting two shots 21 days apart, the younger kids produced levels of protective antibodies comparable to the levels made by 16- to 25-year-olds given two full doses. The companies, which shared the early results via a news release, did not report any data on protection against infection, hospitalization or death from the virus.</p>



<p>That preliminary report is promising, says Debbie-Ann Shirley, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and medical director of the COVID-19 clinic. Side effects from the vaccine were similar to those seen in older children with most being “brief, quickly resolved and mild.”</p>

<p>Pfizer indicated that it will soon seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use of the vaccine in 5- to 11-year-olds. Both the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must still vet and sign off on use of the vaccine in kids. “We’re still a couple of steps away before we might be able to put it into the arms of children,” Shirley says.</p>



<p>The news comes as cases of COVID-19 among children remain at their highest levels since the pandemic began, mostly driven by infections with delta variant. In the United States, <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%209.16%20FINAL.pdf">nearly 226,000 children were diagnosed</a> with the disease in the week ending September 16, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. While COVID-19 remains a mild disease for most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">who become infected</a>, a total of <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3">516 children have died of COVID-19</a> since the beginning of the pandemic, including 100 who died since August 4 (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Soaring infections</h3>



<p>After dipping to 8,447 child cases the week ending June 24, the coronavirus has made a resurgence fueled by the delta variant. COVID-19 infections in children in the United States have reached record levels in recent weeks, peaking at 251,781 cases the week ending September 2. That peak surpasses the previous record of 211,466 cases, set the week ending January 14 in the midst of the pandemic’s winter surge. These data are from 49 states (Nebraska stopped reporting COVID-19 data at the end of June), New York City, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam.</p>

</div>



<p>Along with the upsurge of cases, hospitalizations of children with COVID-19 have also skyrocketed, taxing pediatric health systems in some places. Most of the adolescents hospitalized are unvaccinated, even though they are eligible to get the shots, Shirley says. Nationally, about 52 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC data show.</p>



<p>Also troubling is that doctors are now seeing an uptick in cases of MIS-C, an inflammatory condition that strikes weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Even if the initial infection was mild or asymptomatic, the inflammatory syndrome can cause organ failure and death in otherwise healthy children. At UVA, “last week we started to see an increase in MIS-C cases right on target,” Shirley says.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/52Dm6C9xjm4/">Identity in Peer Review: Looking Forward, Looking Back</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>This post is written by PLOS&rsquo; Editorial Director Suzanne Farley</em></p>



<p>Peer Review Week didn&rsquo;t exist when I got my start in STM publishing. 2021&rsquo;s celebration of this tenacious tenet of quality control in scholarly communication has me meandering down memory lane. Back in the day of small-scale publishing in Australia, we were still mailing unsolicited hardcopy manuscripts to prospective peer reviewers. Editorial feedback was scribbled in the margins. And everything was tracked in a desk-sized, color-coded ledger. Ah, how I loved its color-coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, consideration of &lsquo;identity&rsquo;&mdash;the <a href="https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com/peer-review-week-2021/">theme of Peer Review Week</a> this year&mdash;was extremely limited. Does the invitee have the right subject-expertise? Do they work with the authors? Have I sent them any other manuscripts recently? &lsquo;DEI&rsquo; was not an acronym that any of us could have defined even though diverse perspectives, discussion, and collaboration have always been key to strengthening scientific progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A New Era of Peer Review</strong></p>



<p>Fast-forward two decades and DEI frameworks and approaches&nbsp;are rightly being centered in scholarly communication discussions, resulting in better benchmarks and knowledge-sharing that give publishers and other organizations the means to better track and hold ourselves accountable for creating a&nbsp; genuinely inclusive academic ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But enhancing diversity necessitates establishing identity, and many of us are struggling with the practicalities. Our go-to databases for sourcing peer reviewers don&rsquo;t include reliable demographic indicators. We make clumsy inferences based on names and locations, while trying to be mindful of our own unconscious biases. We manually trawl non-traditional sources. New lists of historically under-represented researchers are popping up all the time, but they are yet to be centrally curated. And what about <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR</a>? Doing it right takes more time. And no one wants peer review to take longer than it already does.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges, we all as publishers owe a duty to the trust and integrity of the scientific record to be actively involved in bringing the distinct identities and unique perspectives, knowledge, and diversity of all researchers to the process. Doing it right takes organizational commitment&mdash;including investment in extra resources and new ways of working. At PLOS, a new DEI-focused workflow for recruitment of Editorial Board members (EBMs) ensures we&rsquo;re casting a wider net. (Want to be considered? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign-up here</a>!). Establishing a baseline so we can track improvements is also underway; a DEI-focused survey of EBMs will be deployed soon. And <a href="https://plos.org/resources/editor-center/conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Editorial Board Member Code of Conduct</a> headlines inclusion and bias minimization.</p>



<p>A core tenet for PLOS has been to increase transparency at all stages of review and to offer inclusive forms of assessment for the researchers and reviewers involved in publishing. Authors who have published in our journals are often invited to peer review. Researchers at institutions with whom PLOS has partnered are another potential source of new expertise. So, we&rsquo;ve been focusing on expanding our global footprint. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our newest journals</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/partnering-with-tcc-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with TCC Africa</a>, are just two examples of this effort. And the transparency of PLOS&rsquo; manuscript processing&mdash;where peer reviewers can choose to sign their reports, and authors can choose to publish their peer review commentary&mdash;confers visibility; seeing those with whom one identifies making a valuable contribution to a community encourages participation.</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating Reviewers in Peer Review</strong></p>



<p>Peer review will still be around long after I&rsquo;ve left scholarly publishing. There&rsquo;ll be ever more ways of doing it&mdash;formal and informal, pre-and post-publication, blinded and unblinded&mdash;facilitated by ever more platforms and technologies. A diversity of models which will hopefully be mirrored by a diversity of participatory identities.</p>



<p>However the future of peer review takes shape, it is important to continue highlighting and celebrating the individual contributions that reviewers make every day. PLOS is thankful to all reviewers that work with us and we look forward to continuing to learn from their individual experiences and tackling challenges in peer review together.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-scientific-surprises-science-news-first-100-years">The Top 10 scientific surprises of Science News’ first 100 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the day Archimedes cut his bath short to shout “Eureka,” science has been a constant source of surprises.</p>



<p>Even after the abundant accumulation of knowledge in the intervening two millennia, science still retains the capacity to astonish, and the century since <em>Science News</em> began reporting has produced its share of shocking discoveries. Some such surprises happened suddenly (if not necessarily with eureka moments); in other cases, revolutionary shifts in understanding took a while to seep slowly into general scientific awareness.</p>



<p>In either case, <em>Science News</em> was sooner or later on the job during the last 100 years, identifying and reporting the never-ending series of surprises, too numerous to mention here, except for my Top 10.</p>



<h3>10. Parity violation</h3>





<p>In the 20th century, physicists established the importance of mathematical symmetries in the laws of nature. While all sorts of changes occur in the physical world, the equations describing them remain the same. So it seemed obvious that viewing the universe in a mirror — switching left and right — should have no effect on the accuracy of those equations. Hermann Weyl, a prominent mathematician who died in 1955, boldly stated that “there can be no doubt that all natural laws are invariant with respect to an interchange of right with left.”</p>



<p>But then in 1956 physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang published a theoretical paper suggesting otherwise, and almost immediately two teams of experimenters showed that nature did indeed distinguish left from right (in technical terms, violating parity). Radioactive beta decay of cobalt atoms and the decay of unstable particles called muons both exhibited a left-right disparity in the directions traveled by the emitted beta particles — a major surprise. “It was socko!” recalled Leon Lederman, one of the experimenters, in an interview four decades later. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-atomic-matter-laws">New atomic matter laws</a>” proclaimed the headline in <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor to <em>Science News</em>, with the subhead declaring the results “a revolution in theoretical physics.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>





<h3>9. Inert gases make compounds</h3>



<p>In the 1890s, chemists added a whole new family of elements to Dmitrii Mendeleev’s periodic table — the inert gases. Helium (detected on the sun decades earlier but not on Earth until 1895), neon, argon, xenon, krypton and radon had been previously missed because they did not — as far as anybody could tell — make compounds with other elements. Those reaction-resistant atoms became known as the inert or noble gases, as under ordinary conditions they all existed in the gaseous state. Textbooks all taught that the arrangement of electrons around the inert gas atoms precluded any opportunity for chemical combination.</p>



<p>Yet in 1962, a <em>Science News Letter</em> headline proclaimed “‘<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/impossible-compound-made-inert-gas">Impossible’ compound made with inert gas</a>.” That article reported a xenon compound, xenon tetrafluoride, created at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, while acknowledging that earlier in 1962 chemist Neil Bartlett had already prepared another xenon compound, xenon-platinum hexafluoride. Chemists had to scramble to revise their textbooks, and scientists everywhere were reminded that you shouldn’t always believe what you’re told.</p>



<h3>8. Plate tectonics</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, many earth scientists were stunned to learn that the textbooks describing the planet’s history needed to be thrown away. Alfred Wegener, however, would not have been so surprised. Wegener, who died in 1930, was an astronomer-turned-meteorologist who dabbled in paleontology and geophysics. In 1915 he wrote a book proposing that the Earth’s continents had once been assembled in a single land mass, called Pangaea; they then, over millions of years, drifted apart to their positions on today’s world map. That map is not a permanent portrait of the Earth’s features, Wegener contended, but rather a snapshot snagged from a long-running movie. But few people believed Wegener, and geophysicists argued that such large-scale motion of such huge rigid masses was physically inexplicable. Wegener’s idea of continental drift did not die, though. Geologists knew all about it. But it remained heresy until the 1960s, when magnetic patterns detected on the seafloor suggested that oceans had expanded, pushing the continents away from one another.</p>



<p>“New evidence … supports the long-debated theory that continents were once connected and have drifted apart,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/evidence-continents-drift"><em>Science News Letter</em> reported in 1963</a>. Further work over the next few years showed that continental drift was a symptom of elaborate mechanisms inside the Earth that came to be known as plate tectonics. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">Plate tectonics explains</a> not only the locations of the continents, but also how mountain ranges form and why earthquakes cluster in well-delineated zones of seismic activity. By 1969, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/time-theory"><em>Science News</em> quoted experts</a> declaring that it was time for “plate tectonics to be accepted as a basic theoretical model in geophysics.” And while many authorities for years remained reluctant to accept it, the decades following confirmed the surprising conclusion that Wegener had been essentially correct.</p>



<h3>7. DNA makes genes</h3>



<p>One of the last century’s most dramatic discoveries came in 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick, aided by an X-ray image produced by Rosalind Franklin, figured out the double helix structure of the genetic molecule DNA. But perhaps the bigger surprise came a few years earlier, when Oswald Avery and colleagues at Rockefeller University in New York City showed that DNA was the substance that genes are made from. Although the reality of genes had been established in the early years of the 20th century, nobody had any good evidence about their physical structure. In the 1920s, “people were just as vague about what genes were … as they are now about consciousness,” Crick said in a 1998 interview. “The more professional people in the field … thought that it was a problem that was too early to tackle.”</p>

Barrington Brown/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>By the 1940s, the predominant view was that genes must be constructed from proteins of some sort. DNA was just an obscure organic acid. But in 1944, Avery and colleagues demonstrated that genes consisted of strands of DNA, not proteins. <em>Science News Letter</em>, however, apparently did not notice the Avery paper, citing instead two subsequent studies, in 1950 and 1952, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chemical-cell-clue-way-heredity-works">confirming DNA as the genetic material</a>. In 1953, though, <em>Science News Letter</em> recognized the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/top-1953-science-stories">DNA double helix structure as the top science story of the year</a>. “Way life is handed on” headlined <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/way-life-handed">the story on Watson and Crick’s proposal for how DNA replication</a> serves as the basis for heredity.</p>



<h3>6. Dark energy</h3>



<p>By the 1990s, the Big Bang theory of the expanding universe had been established beyond reasonable doubt, but questions remained. Chief among them was the fate of the universe. Most experts believed that the gravitational pull of mass throughout the universe was slowing its expansion down. But they debated whether there was enough mass to reverse the expansion altogether, shrinking the cosmos into a “big crunch.” Some thought the universe would expand forever, if at an ever-diminishing rate.</p>



<p>The plot in that story twisted rather shockingly in 1998, when two teams of astronomers reported measurements of light from distant supernovas. Those reports, subsequently bolstered by additional data, revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">universal expansion was not slowing, but accelerating</a>. Some repulsive force, nicknamed “dark energy” in the absence of firm knowledge of its true nature, apparently pervades the cosmos. Researchers were “stunned to find that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">cosmos was expanding 10 to 15 percent more slowly in the past</a> than can be accounted for” without a repulsive force today, <em>Science News</em> reported.</p>



<h3>5. Dark matter</h3>



<p>In the 1930s, physicist-astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that the velocities of galaxies moving within a group called the Coma cluster seemed to defy expectations based on the gravitational effects of the visible mass. Zwicky concluded that some unseen matter — he called it <em>dunkle Materie</em>, or “dark matter” — must be lurking in the cluster to reconcile the observations with the law of gravity. Later astronomer Horace Babcock and others noticed a similar discrepancy in the outer reaches of some galaxies: Stars revolved around a galaxy’s outer edges much faster than allowed by the galaxy’s apparent mass. In the 1970s and thereafter, astronomer Vera Rubin and collaborators confirmed the rapid velocity of the outer stars in many galaxies. As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-halo-hints-galaxys-dark-matter"><em>Science News</em> reported in 1994</a>, “Such behavior is a dead giveaway that the visible disk of these galaxies lies embedded in a much larger and more massive halo of unseen material.”</p>

<p>While the realization that most of the universe’s matter couldn’t be seen was surprising enough, an even greater surprise came when several lines of evidence affirmed that the dark matter could not be of the same type of matter known on Earth, composed primarily of protons and neutrons. Dark matter’s actual identity remains a mystery to this day; physicists have proposed some well-motivated possibilities, but the prospect remains that dark matter’s true nature will also come as a surprise.</p>



<h3>4. Atomic bomb and nuclear fission</h3>



<p>From the time of the discovery of radioactivity, physicists had speculated on the hidden energy packed into every piece of matter. And after Einstein published his famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, it was clear that the amount of that energy would be enormous. But most experts doubted there would be any practical way to release such energy for useful purposes, or warfare weaponry. But in late 1938, chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann found that experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons produced evidence of the much lighter element barium. Lise Meitner (who had collaborated with Hahn before fleeing Nazi Germany) and her nephew Otto Frisch figured out what had happened — the uranium nucleus had been split into pieces. Frisch immediately told Niels Bohr, about to board a ship for America. And soon after Bohr arrived, the word was out. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-energy-released">Atomic energy released” headlined a <em>Science News Letter</em> cover story</a> in early 1939, while reassuring its readers that “physicists are anxious that there be no public alarm over the possibility of the world being blown to bits by their experiments.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="403" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680.jpg" alt="black and white photos of the atomic bomb explosions" class="wp-image-3099698" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680-646x383.jpg 646w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680-314x186.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3099698">In 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima (left) and Nagasaki (right). <em>Science News Letter</em> called the bombs “doomsday thunderbolts.”</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099698">From left: George R. Caron/Wikimedia Commons; Charles Levy/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Soon, though, nuclear fission was transformed into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">a massive war project for building an unimaginably powerful explosive</a>, shocking the world with its potential for destruction, while offering only partially fulfilled hope for a reliable source of useful energy. “Doomsday thunderbolts,” as <em>Science News Letter</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mass-collaboration">labeled the atomic bombs dropped on Japan</a>, “herald a revolution in war such as has not been seen since the first use of gunpowder, and later on another revolution in industry probably greater than the one ushered in by the invention of the steam engine.”</p>



<h3>3. Expanding universe</h3>



<p>Philosophers and physicists alike had long pondered deep questions about the nature of the universe — whether it was finite or infinite, for instance, or whether it had a beginning or had existed eternally. But just about everybody believed that on the whole it never changed, but rather just existed, its objects rotating and revolving in cycles that forever repeated. Only a rare few (the poet Edgar Allan Poe, for example) had imagined an evolving, changing universe. But in the 1920s, mathematician Alexander Friedmann suggested that the universe might be growing or shrinking, based on his solutions to the equations of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Einstein himself had noticed that possibility earlier, but altered his equations so that they would predict an unchanging universe, as he knew of no evidence that it was otherwise.</p>



<p>But such evidence was already being collected, in measurements of the colors of light emitted by distant nebulae (later called galaxies). Analysis of that data led Edwin Hubble to show, in 1929, that the farther away a galaxy was, the faster it was flying away — implying (although Hubble didn’t immediately agree) that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">the universe is in fact expanding</a>. “The distant nebulae are rushing away from us at tremendous speeds and thus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/death-universe-required-physical-law-may-be-avoided">the real universe is constantly expanding</a>,” <em>Science News Letter</em> reported in 1931.</p>



<h3>2. Antimatter</h3>



<p>In 1930, <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported on an incredibly bold proposal by a young British physicist named Paul Dirac. He argued that matter — the solidity from which physical objects are constructed — was in fact nothing more than a bunch of “holes” in the vacuum of space. Space, he suggested, is not empty, but rather completely full of electrons endowed with “negative energy.” Those negative energy electrons could not be detected. But in spots where a negative-energy electron had been given enough energy to lift it from the negative-energy sea, a hole would form, like an empty bubble in an ocean. The absence of the electron would make the hole appear to have a positive electric charge.</p>



<p>Dirac presumed such positively charged bubbles in the negative-energy ocean would correspond to protons, the fundamental particle making up the bulk of the mass of all atoms — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/material-objects-seen-holes-space-british-scientist">in other words, all matter</a>. But that turned out not to be the surprise, because Dirac was wrong. He soon realized that the positively charged holes could not be protons, but rather must be much lighter, with the same mass as an ordinary negatively charged electron. Dirac thus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">predicted the existence of antimatter, an entirely novel idea</a>. An ordinary electron meeting its antimatter particle would disappear by filling the hole, releasing a burst of energy in the process.</p>



<p>Dirac’s “anti-electron” was very shortly thereafter detected in cosmic rays by physicist Carl Anderson, who reported “the probable existence of a … <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-106">positively charged particle of the mass of the familiar negative electron</a>.” &nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Uncertainty principle</h3>



<p>In 1927, Werner Heisenberg announced his uncertainty principle, the core idea underlying the newborn math for describing nature known as quantum mechanics. Heisenberg’s principle expressed the shocking realization that the unbroken chain of cause and effect deduced from Newtonian physics was an illusion, an approximation that nature did not observe on the subatomic scale. It took a couple of years, but <em>Science News-Letter</em> proclaimed “‘<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/uncertainty-principle-enters-science">Uncertainty principle’ enters science</a>” in a 1929 headline. “Crudely stated, the new theory holds that chance rules the physical world,” the article announced. “These weird sounding consequences arise from the contention that a particle may have an exact place or an exact speed, but it can not have both.” The report called it a “disturbing idea” that would “revolutionize the ideas of the universe … to an even greater extent than Einstein’s relativity” and was sure to make a stir “once philosophers and laymen begin their attempts at its interpretation.” Such attempts continue today — and any future interpretation succeeding in forging a consensus will surely come as an especially unexpected surprise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-mega-constellations-night-sky-stars-simulations">Satellite swarms may outshine the night sky’s natural constellations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fleets of private satellites orbiting Earth will be visible to the naked eye in the next few years, sometimes all night long.</p>



<p>Companies like SpaceX and Amazon have launched hundreds of satellites into low orbits since 2019, with plans to launch thousands more in the works — a trend that’s alarming astronomers. The goal of these satellite “mega-constellations” is to bring high-speed internet around the globe, but<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy"> these bright objects threaten</a> to disrupt astronomers’ ability to observe the cosmos (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>). “For astronomers, this is kind of a pants-on-fire situation,” says radio astronomer Harvey Liszt of the National Radio Astronomical Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.</p>



<p>Now, a new simulation of the potential positions and brightness of these satellites shows that, contrary to earlier predictions, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04328">casual sky watchers will have their view disrupted</a>, too. And parts of the world will be affected more than others, astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada and her colleagues report in a paper posted September 9 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“How will this affect the way the sky looks to your eyeballs?” Lawler asks. “We humans have been looking up at the night sky and analyzing patterns there for as long as we’ve been human. It’s part of what makes us human.” These mega-constellations could mean “we’ll see a human-made pattern more than we can see the stars, for the first time in human history.”</p>





<p>Flat, smooth surfaces on satellites can reflect sunlight depending on their position in the sky. Earlier research had suggested that most of the new satellites would not be visible with the naked eye.</p>



<p>Lawler, along with Aaron Boley of the University of British Columbia and Hanno Rein of the University of Toronto at Scarborough in Canada, started building their simulation with public data about the launch plans of four companies — SpaceX’s Starlink, Amazon’s Kuiper, OneWeb and StarNet/GW — that had been filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the International Telecommunications Union. The filings detailed the expected orbital heights and angles of 65,000 satellites that could be launched over the next few years.</p>



<p>“It’s impossible to predict the future, but this is realistic,” says astronomer Meredith Rawls of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the new study. “A lot of times when people make these simulations, they pick a number out of a hat. This really justifies the numbers that they pick.”</p>



<p>There are currently about <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/osoindex/search-ng.jspx?lf_id=#?c=%7B%22filters%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22en%23object.status.inOrbit_s1%22,%22value%22:%22Yes%22%7D%5D,%22sortings%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22object.launch.dateOfLaunch_s1%22,%22dir%22:%22desc%22%7D%5D%7D">7,890 objects in Earth orbit</a>, about half of which are operational satellites, according to the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-spacex-crew-launch-mars-satellites-2020">that number is increasing fast</a> as companies launch more and more satellites (<em>SN: 12/28/20</em>). In August 2020, there were only about 2,890 operational satellites.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers computed how many satellites will be in the sky at different times of year, at different hours of the night and from different positions on Earth’s surface. They also estimated how bright the satellites were likely to be at different hours of the day and times of the year.</p>



<p>That calculation required a lot of assumptions because companies aren’t required to publish details about their satellites like the materials they’re made of or their precise shapes, both of which can affect reflectivity. But there are enough satellites in orbit that Lawler and colleagues could compare their simulated satellites to the light reflected down to Earth by the real ones.</p>



<p>The simulations showed that “the way the night sky is going to change will not affect all places equally,” Lawler says. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04328">places where naked-eye stargazing</a> will be most affected are at latitudes 50° N and 50° S, regions that cross lower Canada, much of Europe, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, and the southern tips of Chile and Argentina, the researchers found.</p>

<p>“The geometry of sunlight in the summer means there will be hundreds of visible satellites all night long,” Lawler says. “It’s bad everywhere, but it’s worse there.” For her, this is personal: She lives at 50° N.</p>



<p>Closer to the equator, where many research observatories are located, there is a period of about three hours in the winter and near the time of the spring and fall equinoxes with few or no sunlit satellites visible. But there are still hundreds of sunlit satellites all night at these locations in the summer.</p>



<p>A few visible satellites can be a fun spectacle, Lawler concedes. “I think we really are at a transition point here where right now, seeing a satellite, or even a Starlink train, is cool and different and wow, that’s amazing,” she says. “I used to look up when the [International Space Station] was overhead.” But she compares the coming change to watching one car go down the road 100 years ago, versus living next to a busy freeway now.</p>



<p>“Every sixteenth star will actually be moving,” she says. “I hope I’m wrong. I’ve never wanted to be wrong about a simulation more than this. But without mitigation, this is what the sky will look like in a few years.”</p>



<p>Astronomers have been <a href="https://aas.org/satellite-constellations-2-workshop">meeting with representatives</a> from private companies, as well as space lawyers and government officials, to work out compromises and mitigation strategies. Companies have been testing ways to reduce reflectivity, like shading the satellites with a “visor.” Other proposed strategies include limiting the satellites to lower orbits, where they move faster across the sky and leave a fainter streak in telescope images. Counterintuitively, lower satellites may be better for some astronomy research, Rawls says. “They move out of the way quick.”</p>



<p>But that lower altitude strategy will mean more visible satellites for other parts of the world, and more that are visible to the naked eye. “There’s not some magical orbital altitude that solves all our problems,” Rawls says. “There are some latitudes on Earth where no matter what altitude you put your satellites at, they’re going to be all over the darn place. The only way out of this is fewer satellites.”</p>



<p>There are currently no regulations concerning how bright a satellite can be or how many satellites a private company can launch. Scientists are grateful that companies are willing to work with them, but nervous that their cooperation is voluntary.</p>



<p>“A lot of the people who work on satellites care about space. They’re in this industry because they think space is awesome,” Rawls says. “We share that, which helps. But it doesn’t fix it. I think we need to get some kind of regulation as soon as possible.” (Representatives from Starlink, Kuiper and OneWeb did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>



<p>Efforts are under way to bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations and to try to use existing environmental regulations to place limits on satellite launches, says study coauthor Boley (who also lives near 50° N).</p>



<p>Analogies to other global pollution problems, like space junk, can provide inspiration and precedents, he says. “There are a number of ways forward. We shouldn’t just lose hope. We can do things about this.”</p>

<h4>What makes a modern human?</h4>



<p><em>Just 1.5 to 7 percent of human DNA is unique to modern humans, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-our-dna-is-uniquely-human">Most human DNA is not unique to us</a>” (</em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 7<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Mark Jenike </strong>wondered how the new research squares with the well-known finding that we humans share more than 98 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos. “Are these two statistics measuring different things?” <strong>Jenike </strong>asked.</p>



<p>That shared DNA was likely passed down from the most recent common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, <strong>Saey</strong> says, and is common among all modern and ancient humans. The question asked in the study, however, is how much of our DNA is found only in anatomically modern humans, and not in Neandertals, Denisovans or other extinct ancient human relatives, she says.</p>





<p>“It’s important to remember that the 1.5 to 7 percent of DNA unique to modern humans consists of small genetic changes, and every single person today has them,” <strong>Saey</strong> says. “Overall, humans’ DNA still closely resembles that of other apes such as chimpanzees and bonobos.”</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Chuck Almdale </strong>wondered why the phrase “uniquely human” was used in the story to exclude Neandertals and Denisovans. If the ancient hominids could interbreed and have fertile offspring with modern humans, wouldn’t that make them the same species as us?</p>



<p>Drawing the line between species can sometimes be more of an art than a science, <strong>Saey</strong> says. Modern humans, Neandertals and Denisovans are genetically distinct groups, and while the groups were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">able to mate and reproduce with each other</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 7</em>), that doesn’t necessarily make them the same species, she says.</p>



<p>Even scientists don’t agree on whether these three groups really are separate species, <strong>Saey</strong> says. What’s more, not all scientists use the term “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">human</a>” the same way.</p>



<h4>Martian rumblings</h4>



<p><em>Analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander suggest that Mars’ core is at least partially liquid and somewhat larger than expected, <strong>Sid Perkins </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Quakes offer a peek inside Mars</a>” (</em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 9<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Perkins</strong> wrote that volcanic activity in a region of Mars that’s home to large volcanoes could trigger quakes or seismic waves. Reader <strong>Jim Sanborn </strong>pointed out that this statement seems to contradict another story in the same issue, “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-lakes-liquid-water-south-pole-ice-cap-mirages">Mars lakes appear to be mirages</a>” (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 8</em>). In that story, <strong>Adam Mann </strong>reported that it’s unlikely that liquid lakes lurk under the Red Planet’s southern polar ice cap. An underground magma pool would be needed to keep the lakes from freezing, but the planet appears to lack recent volcanic activity, he reported.</p>



<p>It’s true that there haven’t been signs of ongoing volcanic activity on Mars in recent times, <strong>Perkins </strong>says, although a study published in the Sept. 1 <em>Icarus</em> suggests that lava may have flowed from a fissure in the planet as recently as about 50,000 years ago. If any molten rock were to move within the planet, either underneath ancient volcanoes or elsewhere, it could potentially trigger marsquakes and seismic waves, he says.</p>



<h4>Corrections</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-otter-warmth-mitochondria-muscle-metabolism-biology">How muscle cells keep otters warm</a>” (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 13</em>) incorrectly described the effect of surface area on heat loss. Small bodies with less surface area don’t lose heat faster; small bodies with greater surface area relative to their volume do. </p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">Roads to the good life</a>” (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 24</em>) incorrectly stated the name of a journal in which research by psychologist Shigehiro Oishi of the University of Virginia and social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida appears. The study, which suggests that major life events can contribute to higher psychological richness, was published in <em>Psychological Review</em>, not <em>Psychological Science</em>.</p>

                <p>Our readers are newshounds with boundless curiosity, always eager to learn what’s new, significant or surprising. With each issue, we try to feed that desire for credible, concise — even entertaining — news from many science fields. This issue, too, ranges far and wide. We cover new evidence that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">may be getting better at taking flight</a> on tiny airborne particles, as well as an experiment suggesting that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-surfing-shock-wave-physics-particle-laser">protons can catch a shock wave</a>. And we had to share a story supporting what sports lovers already knew in their hearts: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sports-soccer-ghost-games-psychology-fans-referee-pandemic">Home team advantage fades when the fans stay home</a>.</p>



<p>I’m also excited for you to read the latest feature in our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century">Century of Science series</a>. Each of these stories offers a deep dive into discoveries that <em>Science News</em> has covered over the last 100 years. This latest one is relevant to all of us: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">how our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, came to be</a>. Managing editor <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-wayman">Erin Wayman</a> was the perfect person to take on this project. With a graduate degree in biological anthropology, she has extensive knowledge of primate behavior and human evolution. As obsessed as she is with the topic (each table at her wedding had its own monkey theme), even she was surprised to learn how much has changed since her university days. Many of us take for granted that our ancient ancestors came from Africa, yet the search for human origins focused on Europe and Asia until the 1924 discovery of a skull in South Africa. Even in the mid-20th century, there were still doubts that Africa held the secrets of our beginnings. </p>



<p>As our species continues to evolve and grow in numbers, one of the biggest challenges we face is climate change. <em>Science News</em> intern Nikk Ogasa describes how climate change is imperiling <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3103789">one of the world’s key food staples, rice</a>. Time for the big brains of <em>H. sapiens</em> to come through with bright ideas to rescue rice to feed the world.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/the-census-and-entitled-resentment/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-17-15_56_36-census-2020usagraphic-1.jpg-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Entitled people tend to resist and resent change. For entitled white people, the latest Census data triggers panic at being replaced by those who have historically been on the margins. Whites have enjoyed being at the center of society. Politicians legislate to their needs. White people are able to move through society without being derailed or diminished by racism.</p><p>Political conservatives are both <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380">against immigration and more entitled</a> than Democrats. And now white people, particularly those who voted for Donald Trump, see the coming demographic change as them being pushed out of the center of society and into the margins. They fear being moved into the position that immigrants and people of color have historically occupied.</p><p>From a psychological perspective, entitlement refers to one’s sense of deservingness. Entitled people believe they deserve more than others. They tend to have expectations that do not match their input, their performance, or the reality on the ground. One’s level of entitlement emerges from a variety of factors, but one’s proximity to power is a major contributor to entitlement. Those closest to power, including cultural power, are more likely to have an outsized sense of entitlement. Groups seen as the cultural default, the standard, “normal” identity in a category, have higher levels of entitlement. So, for example, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-00497-001">men tend to feel more entitled</a> than women.</p><p>Now pair United States demographic change with the rising income inequality of the last 30 years and you have entitled resentment. Too many white Republicans who are struggling economically avoid looking up at billionaires who benefit from an unequal system that allows them to pay virtually no taxes. Instead, they punch down at poor people and people of color whom they scapegoat even though they are not the cause of their economic struggles. Rather than seeing those who don’t share their ethnicity (but do their economy) as allies, they see them as enemies.</p><p>Republican politicians take advantage of the lack of coalitions across race and ethnicity tapping this resentment. Republican policies are unpopular. Their position on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/11/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">guns</a> is unpopular.

And thus, you have the Republican strategy for winning elections. Republicans lose if everyone votes. In 2020 Donald Trump admitted, “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus">you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again</a>” if voting was made easier. And so, Republicans are passing legislation to make voting more difficult. Republican strategy is to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/texas-polling-sites-closures-voting">close polling locations in communities of color</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apnews.com/article/georgia-iowa-voting-rights-elections-coronavirus-pandemic-70e2af9a83688eb236a892e7ad3011a4">restrict early voting</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/10/voting-bill-texas/">ban drive-thru and 24-hour voting options</a>, prevent <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/republicans-launch-attacks-on-voting-by-mail.html">voting by mail</a> (even during a pandemic), require specific kinds of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.statesman.com/news/20160923/politifact-take-gun-license-but-not-student-id-to-texas-polls">identification</a> (e.g., a gun license but not a university ID), launch modern-day <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/09/florida-felony-disenfranchisement-pryor-decision.html">poll taxes</a>, and illegitimately <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/voter-purges-wisconsin-republican-election/">removing Latinx and African Americans from voting lists</a>.</p><p>White replacement panic will surely be the response from the contingent that gave us the “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-40911744">You. Will Not. Replace Us!</a>” chant at the recently reported Census trends. The 2020 Census <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/population-changes-nations-diversity.html">data</a> are in and, as expected, the white population in the US has decreased while the number of Asian Americans and Latinx Americans has increased. Whites remain the largest racial/ethnic group, but their numbers have decreased to just under 60% of the US population. In addition, rural areas of the country with concentrated numbers of white people are shrinking. Correspondingly, counties that voted for Donald Trump are declining.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marguerite-vogt-polio-virus-lab-research-virology">By taking on poliovirus, Marguerite Vogt transformed the study of all viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>When nobody else wanted the job, Marguerite Vogt stepped in.</p>



<p>Working from early morning until late at night in a small, isolated basement laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, Vogt painstakingly handled test tubes and petri dishes under a fume hood: incubating, pipetting, centrifuging, incubating again. She was trying to grow a dangerous pathogen: poliovirus.</p>



<p>It was 1952 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/now-polio">polio was one of the most feared diseases in America</a>, paralyzing more than 15,000 people, mostly children, each year. Parents <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/dos-and-donts-polio">wouldn’t let their children play outside</a>, and quarantines were instituted in neighborhoods with polio cases.</p>

<p>Scientists were desperate for information about the virus, but many were hesitant to work with the infectious agent. “Everybody was afraid to go to that little lab in the basement,” says Martin Haas, professor of biology and oncology at the University of California, San Diego, and a personal friend and collaborator of Vogt’s for over three decades.</p>



<p>Vogt, a brand-new research associate in the laboratory of Renato Dulbecco, took on the task of attempting to grow and isolate the virus on a layer of monkey kidney cells. The method was called a plaque assay for the distinctive round plaques that form when a single virus particle kills all the cells around it.</p>



<p>Vogt didn’t tell her parents, both acclaimed scientists in Germany, that she was working with the virus. She later remarked that her father would have been very angry had he known of her poliovirus work, Haas says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="442" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline3_child.jpg" alt="black and white image of Marlene Olsen with her toys" class="wp-image-3103669" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline3_child.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline3_child-589x383.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline3_child-286x186.jpg 286w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103669">Marlene Olsen, age 4, was stricken with polio in the summer of 1955. The disease paralyzed many thousands of people each year, mostly children.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103669">AP Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After a year of persistence, Vogt succeeded (and remained virus-free). In 1954, she and Dulbecco <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2180341/">published</a> the method for purifying and counting poliovirus particles. It was immediately used by other scientists to study variants of poliovirus, and by microbiologist Albert Sabin to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/develop-new-polio-vaccine">identify and isolate strains of weakened poliovirus</a> to make<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/live-oral-polio-vaccine-proved-safe-and-effective"> the oral polio vaccine</a> used in mass vaccination campaigns around the world.</p>



<p>Perhaps even more importantly, the poliovirus plaque assay enabled scientists worldwide to analyze animal viruses at the level of individual cells, a field now known as molecular virology. Vogt and Dulbecco’s approach remains the gold standard for purifying and counting virus particles, including in recent studies of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The method, used to measure how infectious a virus is and isolate strains of a virus for further research, is ubiquitous in labs around the world.</p>

<p>Throughout a career spanning three-quarters of a century, beginning with a publication when she was 14 years old, Vogt contributed extensively to our knowledge of the genetics of animal development, how viruses can cause cancer and cellular life cycles. Upon her death in 2007 at the age of 94, nearly 100 three-ring binders lined the shelves of her office, filled with notes on decades of experiments.</p>



<p>Vogt was known for her intense, inventive lab work, including what others have called her “green thumb” for tissue culture — the process of growing cells, viruses and tissues in a dish.</p>



<p>“Being a meticulous person, she worried about every detail of the process of cell culture,” says David Baltimore, biologist and president emeritus of Caltech who worked for three years in a lab close to Dulbecco’s. “That’s really important, because it is finicky. Long experience and precise handling are key to getting good data.”</p>



<p>Born in 1913, Vogt grew up in Germany surrounded by science. The younger daughter of two pioneers of brain research, Oskar and Cécile Vogt, she and her sister Marthe were budding scientists from their youth. Marguerite Vogt’s first paper, published in 1927, investigated the genetics of fruit fly development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="425" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline4_family.jpg" alt="black and white image of Oskar and Cécile Vogt" class="wp-image-3103666" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline4_family.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline4_family-613x383.jpg 613w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight_vogt_inline4_family-298x186.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103666">After being ousted from Berlin by the Nazis, Marguerite Vogt’s parents, Oskar and Cécile Vogt, pictured here, set up a private brain research institute in Germany’s Black Forest.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103666">Courtesy of Martin Haas</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But a year after receiving her M.D. at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1936, Vogt and her liberal family were ousted from Berlin by the Nazis. Her parents lost their positions at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research (now the Max Planck Institute), and Oskar was accused of supporting communists. The family avoided arrest or death due to the intercession of the Krupp family, former patients of Oskar’s and well-connected arms manufacturers who supplied the Nazi regime. With funding from the Krupps, Oskar and Cécile set up a private brain research institute in a remote part of Germany’s Black Forest. There, they continued their research and offered shelter and jobs to other people fleeing Nazi persecution.</p>



<p>From her parents’ institute in the Black Forest, Vogt published 39 seminal papers on how hormones and genetics influence the development of fruit flies, work that was later considered ahead of its time. In 1950, with the help of German-American scientists Hermann Muller and Max Delbrück, Vogt emigrated from Germany to the United States. Vogt rarely talked about her experiences during World War II. She never returned to Germany and refused to speak her native tongue with visiting German students and scientists.</p>



<p>After briefly working with Delbrück on bacterial genetics, Vogt went to work for Dulbecco on the poliovirus assay in 1952. After that success, the pair investigated the role of viruses in cancer. Once again, Vogt developed a technique to grow a virus — this time a small DNA-containing virus called polyomavirus — and the pair was able to count how many cells the virus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC222842/?page=1">transformed</a> into cancer cells. In subsequent papers, the team demonstrated that certain viruses integrate their genetic material into host cell DNA, causing uncontrolled cell growth. The discovery changed the way scientists and doctors thought about cancer, showing that cancer is caused by genetic changes in a cell.</p>

Dulbecco and M. Vogt/<em>J. Exp. Med. </em>1954</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1963, Vogt followed Dulbecco to the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. There, she spent decades studying viruses that can cause tumors, as well as other areas that sparked her interest, such as trying to define a cellular clock. “She was not only very intense, she was very inventive,” says Haas. “She always knew which way to go and what do to.”</p>



<p>Like the early days studying poliovirus, Vogt worked long and hard, typically six days a week, 10 hours per day. “She liked trying new things, so we often tried to do techniques that she had admired in papers she had read, or we learned things from other labs,” says Candy Haggblom, Vogt’s laboratory assistant for the last 30 years of Vogt’s career.</p>



<p>Vogt never married or had children. “Science was my milk,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/10/science/scientist-at-work-marguerite-vogt-a-lifetime-later-still-in-love-with-the-lab.html">told the <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>in 2001. But Vogt didn’t lack for company: She was a friend and mentor to many of the young scientists in the lab, four of whom went on to earn Nobel Prizes, and as an accomplished pianist and cellist, Vogt hosted a chamber music group that met at her home every Sunday morning for over 40 years, Haas says.</p>





<p>In 1975, Dulbecco was awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1975/summary/">Nobel Prize in physiology</a> or medicine for work on how tumor viruses transform cells, a prize <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/1975-nobel-prizes">shared with Baltimore and virologist Howard Temin</a>. Vogt was not recognized, and Dulbecco did not acknowledge her in his Nobel lecture.</p>



<p>During her lifetime, Vogt did not receive a single major prize or recognition. Despite an advanced degree and prestigious publication record, Vogt did not become a professor or get her own lab at Salk until after Dulbecco left the institute in 1972. She was 59 years old. That rankled her, says Haas, who cared for Vogt later in her life and thought of her like a mother. “She ran his lab while he ran around the world giving talks,” he says. “Marguerite ran it all.”</p>



<p>At 80, Vogt regularly jogged into the lab early in the morning. At 85, she published her final paper, fittingly about how human cells slow down and lose their ability to replicate with age.</p>

Dating of sediment, burned stones and animal teeth excavated there <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00956-1">shows that the tools are around 90,000 to 120,000 years old</a>, the scientists report September 16 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>“Prior to major successful dispersals out of Africa and into Eurasia, <em>Homo sapiens</em> [were] making tools for various specialized functions, and those behaviors would have aided them [in] new environments,” says Hallett, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. Different types of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202021">bone tools from around the time of the Moroccan finds</a> have been unearthed at a handful of other African sites, though uses for many of those items remain unclear. Researchers have largely focused on an explosion of African bone tool styles that appeared around 44,000 years ago, after human expansions into Eurasia.</p>



<p>Of 62 bone implements from the cave, seven were hide scrapers. These tools were crafted from pieces of antelope or wild cattle ribs that were split in half lengthwise and worked into a flat, spatula-like shape. Short, deep grooves and polish on these items resulted from scraping animal hides, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The team unearthed the tools along with skinned animals’ bones. Patterns of stone-tool incisions on limb and jaw bones of sand foxes, golden jackals and wildcats resulted from detaching skin at the paws and pulling it over the head in one piece, providing evidence for the way the bone hide scrapers were used, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Ancient humans could have put hides presumably worked into leather or pelts to various uses, though clothing seems especially likely, Hallett says. DNA evidence of body lice origins suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lice-hang-ancient-date-first-clothes">people began wearing clothes at least 190,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 4/20/10</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-tracks-footprints-ancient-elephant-nursery">Fossil tracks may reveal an ancient elephant nursery</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossilized footprints found on a beach in southern Spain betray what may have been a nursery for an extinct species of elephant.</p>



<p>The track-rich coastal site, which scientists have dubbed the Matalascañas Trampled Surface, is typically covered by 1½ meters of sand, says Clive Finlayson, an evolutionary biologist at the Gibraltar National Museum. But storm surges in the spring of 2020 washed away much of that sand and exposed the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96754-1">preserved footprints of ancient elephants</a>, cattle, deer, pigs, wolves, water birds and even Neandertals, Finlayson and colleagues report September 16 in <em>Scientific Reports. </em>The sandy-clay sediments hosting this trove of tracks were probably laid down about 106,000 years ago, previous studies suggest.</p>



<p>Among the newly uncovered tracks are the first-of-their-kind footprints of newborn <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-shakes-elephant-family-tree">straight-tusked elephants</a> (<em>Palaeoloxodon antiquus</em>), an extinct species that probably died out during the last ice age (<em>SN: 6/13/17</em>). The teeny tracks — which measure 9.6 centimeters across, about the size of a drink coaster — suggest that the petite, possibly 2-month-old pachyderms stood about 66 centimeters tall at their shoulders and weighed around 70 kilograms, slightly heftier than a Newfoundland dog.</p>



<p>Based on previous finds elsewhere of actual bones, adult straight-tusked elephants may have weighed 5.5 metric tons for females and a whopping 13 tons for males.</p>



<p>The mix of elephant tracks at the site suggests that family groups including newborns, juveniles and adult females frequented the area and possibly used it as a nursery, the researchers say. Other fossils found at the site, including those preserving traces of ancient roots, hint that the area was rich in vegetation and speckled with lakes and ponds.</p>

Neto de Carvalho <em>et al</em>/<em>Scientific </em><em>Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team’s findings “are a thrilling study,” says Anthony Martin, a trace fossil expert at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the research. Series of footprints show how the ancient elephants were moving, offer insight into their social structure and even provide a glimpse of their reproductive ecology, he says. If newborns were part of the family group and “if they were acting anything like modern elephants, the mother had to be nearby,” Martin says.</p>



<p>What’s more, the presence of preserved Neandertal footprints at the site suggests that the ancient hominids foraged there and may have preyed upon young elephants or scavenged dead elephants or other creatures, Martin says. The Neandertals “probably were not foolhardy enough to take on a full-sized elephant.”</p>
