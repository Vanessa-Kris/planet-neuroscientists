                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

<p>As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.</p><p><strong>First and foremost – plan</strong><br />More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, are another source of trusted information.</p><p><strong>Disconnect to reconnect</strong><br />After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.</p><p>Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.</p><p><strong>Maintain your foundation</strong><br />Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.</p><p><strong>Reconnect with natural joys</strong><br />Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude and altruism</strong><br />Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.</p><p>The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.</p><p><strong>Know when to seek help</strong><br />Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources">a list of trusted resources</a> and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm"><em>Photo</em></a><em> </em><em>by prostooleh via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/lessons-for-the-coronavirus-from-the-1899-honolulu-plague/" rel="nofollow">Lessons for the coronavirus from the 1899 Honolulu plague</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li></ul> </div>

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.<br /><br />The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852">Bourouiba, 2020</a>). The puff trapped droplets of many sizes and carried them quite a long distance (23-26 feet!) while evading evaporation. Droplets that settle can contaminate surfaces. Aerosols may persist in the air for hours, depending on ambient temperature and humidity, as well as prevailing winds or <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>airflow of indoor ventilation systems</b></span>.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span><br /><br /><a href="https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18357411" target="_blank">Watch the educational video</a> showing Respiratory Pathogen Emission Dynamics and you will be truly horrified!!<br /><br />“<span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>This newer understanding of respiratory emission dynamics has implications for mask and respiratory design, social distancing recommendations, and other public health interventions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</b></span>.”<br /><br /><br />Speaking of masks, droplets are visible after sneezing into a surgical mask (<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/335/7633/1293">Granville-Chapman &amp; Dunn, 2007</a>).

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-how-antibody-blood-tests-work">How antibody tests work and could help fight the coronavirus</a></h4>

<p>The United Kingdom has ordered 3.5
million antibody tests, which would show whether someone has been exposed to COVID-19.
Such tests, which just take a drop of blood, could help reveal people who have
been exposed to the virus and are now likely immune, meaning they could go back
to work and resume their normal lives.</p>



<p>Antibodies are proteins that the body’s
white blood cells produce to fight an infection. They bind to a virus,
preventing it from infecting a cell, and can remain in blood long after the
infection clears. Antibody tests are commonly used to test for exposure to
other viruses.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em>
spoke with David Weiner, director of the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at the
Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, and Charles Cairns, dean of the Drexel University
College of Medicine, about how antibody tests work and what are some of the
challenges of developing the tests. </p>



<p>The
following responses have been edited for brevity and clarity. </p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What does
an antibody test do?  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Cairns:</strong>  Antibody tests look to see if someone has
been exposed to a specific antigen, like a virus. The British tests are designed to work in one of two ways. They
either detect human antibodies in blood using an antigen designed to be similar
to a feature of the virus. Or conversely, the test detects the virus in blood
using a [human-made] antibody designed to trap the virus.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How is it
different from tests that diagnose an infection?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cairns:</strong>  Diagnostic tests are
using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states?utm_source=Coronavirus_Update&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cvupdate032720">RT-PCR tests</a> (<em>SN:
3/6/20</em>). You take a nasal swab (or sputum sample) that identifies the
specific viral RNA from the COVID-19 virus. 
It’s the gold standard to see if you are actively infected. </p>



<p>The
antibody tests are quick — a prick of blood and you get a yes/no answer. You’ve
had COVID-19 or you haven’t. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Why do antibody
tests matter? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Weiner:  </strong>People
who have recovered won’t have RT-PCR positive tests, as they’ve already cleared
the virus. Those who are recovered, those antibodies protect them from
reinfection. (It’s still unclear, however, how long that immunity might last.) </p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>We’re now screening to find people who are positive [and have a current infection]. But it’s important to find people who have recovered and who are unlikely to be reinfected, so they can go out and be the buffers for the rest of us. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">That’s how herd immunity develops</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>).  Antibody tests also give us a better idea of how many people have been infected and how many have recovered, so we can start to move forward. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Who
should be prioritized for getting this test?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Weiner:</strong> I think the first responders and health care workers
should be screened first, because it’s very important for them [to feel
confident] to get back out on the front line.  </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What is
the status of providing widespread antibody testing in the United States? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Cairns:</strong> There are lots of people working on [antibody] tests [in
the United States]. But you’re trying to replicate a gold standard — the RT-PCR
test — with a test that uses smaller amounts of sample, is faster and is available
outside the lab.  </p>



<p>The big question is: Does a positive response for the antibodies mean that person is actively infected, or that they have been infected in the past? The tests need to be accurate, and avoid both false positives and false negatives. That’s the challenge.  </p>

<p>Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Reverse correlation in a nutshell.

Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf">Wikipedia</a>.</figure>



<p>Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:</p>



<ul><li>evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods</li><li>locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets</li></ul>



<p>Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.</p>



<h3>The theory behind reverse correlation</h3>



<p>Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up <a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf">writing my PhD thesis on systems identification</a>, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.</p>



<p>There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097">Franz &amp; Schölkopf (2006)</a>. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="N" /> real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" />:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" /></p>



<p>Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system <img alt="f(\bold x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x)" /> as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" /></p>



<p>Note that the kernels <img alt="h_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_i" /> have increasing order: <img alt="h_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_0" /> is a scalar, <img alt="h_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_1" /> a vector, <img alt="h_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_2" /> a matrix, <img alt="h_3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_3" /> a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion</p></blockquote>



<p>The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function <img alt="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" /> has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb">Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png" />Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.</figure>



<p>This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.</p></blockquote>



<p>To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series">Wiener expansion</a>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" /></p>



<p>And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E_D%5BG_i%28x%29G_j%28x%29%5D+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+i+%5Cne+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" /></p>



<p>Here <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:</p>



<ol><li>Set <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 0</li><li>Set <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 1, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> from <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to make <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> orthogonal to <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /></li><li>Set <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 2, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> and <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> from <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to make <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> orthogonal to both, etc.</li></ol>



<p>This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, <img alt="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" />. Thus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" /></p>



<p>Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:</p>



<ol><li>Estimate the Wiener kernel <img alt="k_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_0" /> from the measured response <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" /></li><li>Project the 0’th order functional out of <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" /> to obtain <img alt="y_{res}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y_{res}" /></li><li>Estimate the Wiener kernel <img alt="k_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_1" /> from the residual <img alt="y_{res}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y_{res}" />, etc.</li></ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.</p></blockquote>



<p>What does <em>estimate</em> mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" /></p>



<p>For the first-order kernel:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" /></p>



<p>Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, <img alt="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" />. The second order kernel is a little more tricky.

<p>Where <img alt="G_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_j" /> are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067">Korenberg et al. 1988</a>). Notice the <img alt="i!" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="i!" /> factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb">This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion</a>.</p>



<p>Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:</p>



<ol><li>Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.</li><li>The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.</li><li>The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.</li></ol>



<p>The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:</p>



<ol><li>Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood</li><li>Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise</li><li>Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood</li><li>Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent</li></ol>



<p>Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>Evolution strategies (ES)</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies">Evolution strategies</a> (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a <em>smoothed</em> gradient via the ES method.</p>



<p>The setup is quite clever. We have a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative <img alt="\nabla f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla f(z)" /> directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, <img alt="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" /> in a local neighborhood <img alt="\pi(\theta, z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi(\theta, z)" />. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.</p>



<p>To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" /></p>



<p>The last equality, which is also called the <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/">log-derivative trick</a>, is derived from:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" /></p>



<p>A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" /></p>



<p>Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking ES to reverse correlation</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png" /><a href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/">From the OpenAI blog</a>.</figure>



<p>The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).</p>



<p>ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.</p>



<p>ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)</a>. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.</li><li><a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html">NES (Natural evolution strategies)</a>. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.</li></ul>



<p>Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.</p>



<p>Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction">variance reduction literature</a> to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb">This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus</a>.</p>



<h3>Locally interpretable models</h3>



<p>There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html">locally interpretable models</a>. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size). The dashed line is the learned explanationthat is locally (but not globally) faithful.

<p>In general, we try to find a model <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> which approximates a complex function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> according to a weight window <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi" />:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3D+%5Csum_i+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cx_i+-+a%7C%7C%5E2%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29+%28f%28x_i%29+-+g%28x_i%29%29+%5E+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2" /></p>



<p>Several choices are possible for <img alt="\Omega(g)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(g)" />. For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as <img alt="\Omega(g)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(g)" />. The model class <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G" /> can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:</p>



<ul><li>a GAM</li><li>a decision tree</li><li>a linear model</li></ul>



<p>If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking LIME to reverse correlation</h4>



<p>An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.</p>



<p>Many articles have documented that <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short">receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles</a>, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.</p>



<p>Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:</p>



<ul><li>the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)</li><li>the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)</li><li>the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)</li></ul>



<p>Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Local linearization of receptive fields" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png" />From <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489">Movshon et al. 1978</a>.</figure>



<p>There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589">A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features</a> that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).</p>



<p>Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short">explain sensory neurons</a> and to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">compress neural networks</a>.</p>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.</p>

are seeking to fill supply gaps in face masks, goggles and other personal
protective equipment, or PPE. </p>



<p>An editorial published March 20 in <em>JAMA</em> requested <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763590">creative ideas</a>.
Proposals have flooded in with predominant themes emerging on how to reuse the face
masks called N95s, thick, tight-fitting masks that can block tiny virus
particles, and how to make alternatives to commercial ones. The innovation on
display convinced surgeon Ed Livingston, a coauthor of the editorial and an
editor at <em>JAMA</em>, that “this is the
biomedical engineering community’s Apollo 13 moment.” </p>





<p>In this fast-moving emergency, it’s unclear which homespun
efforts will help the most. Here’s what we know, and don’t know, about how to
best conserve the PPE that we have and how to make more. </p>





<h4>Make supplies last longer </h4>



<p>Hospitals are asking for donations from anyone who might have PPE on hand, including construction workers, dentists and spa workers. Wearing a single mask for multiple patients is “something that we would normally never do,” Witt says. </p>



<p>Though that practice is not ideal, it might not be terrible.
Masks don’t necessarily pick up a lot of contamination, a small study finds. Researchers
in Singapore swabbed N95 face masks, goggles and shoes of 30 health care
workers as they exited rooms of 15 patients with COVID-19. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/absence-of-contamination-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-by-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2-sarscov2/EA37207FECDD23BE900526CEE5BA9430">No
viral genetic material was detected</a>, the researchers report March 26 in <em>Infection Control &amp; Hospital
Epidemiology</em>, suggesting that extended use of masks and goggles might work,
in certain conditions. The study might have missed some virus on masks due to
the limited way researchers tested the masks. And the patients were in
isolation rooms with 12 air exchanges per hour. Conditions differ at other
health care facilities. </p>



<p>Assuming reused masks are bound to get some level of contamination,
others have been exploring how to best disinfect masks. Time is a powerful
disinfectant; infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19
illness, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973">plummets</a>
after two to three days on hard surfaces. The virus lasts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread">even
less time</a> on other surfaces (<em>SN:
3/4/20</em>). Some researchers have recommended rotating through a series of
masks, so that worn masks can “rest” and passively become virus-free again. </p>



<p>Other suggestions include heat, chemical disinfectants and
ultraviolet light. At the University of Nebraska Medical Center, health care
workers <a href="https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf">hang
up strings of used masks </a>in a room with two UV light towers. After a
treatment of about five minutes, the masks are ready to be used again. The
approach is experimental, and it’s not clear whether multiple rounds of UV light
damages the masks. </p>

Face shields, goggles, gloves and gowns protect health care workers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086444">Sturti/E+/Getty Images plus</span></figure>



<h4>Make masks at home </h4>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new crisis
guidelines to health care workers says that where no face masks are available,
homemade masks, made of bandannas or scarves, for instance, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html">can
be used as a last resort</a>.“That’s
how desperate they are, that they said that,” Livingston says. </p>



<p>Cloth masks aren’t ideal. A 2015 study of over 1,000
healthcare workers in Hanoi, Vietnam, found that those who were assigned to
wear cloth masks were <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006577">more
likely to get a respiratory virus</a> than those who wore medical masks, made
of thick fibers that catch a range of particles. That study appeared in <em>BMJ Open</em>.</p>



<p>Still, homemade cloth masks are better than nothing. “Is it
as good as [masks from] medical grade, quality-controlled, assured storage,
temperature-controlled warehouse? Probably not,” Witt says. “Is it good enough?
Absolutely.” A 2008 study of homemade cloth masks worn by members of the
general public, published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>,
backs that up, finding that though imperfect, homemade masks can <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002618">offer
some protection</a> against viral particles.</p>

<p>The mask needs to strike a balance between filtering
capabilities and breathability. Some materials, such as vacuum bags, are better
at filtering than others, a 2013 study in <em>Disaster
Medicine and Public Health</em> <em>Preparedness
</em>suggests. But vacuum bags are hard to breathe through. Cotton T-shirts
offer a breathable fabric that filtered microorganisms <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0921A05A69A9419C862FA2F35F819D55/S1935789313000438a.pdf/testing_the_efficacy_of_homemade_masks_would_they_protect_in_an_influenza_pandemic.pdf">roughly
half as well</a> as a surgical masks in those experiments.  </p>



<p>Other work-arounds focus on 3-D printing, which can churn
out hard, clear face shields that protect health care workers’ eyes and possibly
extend the life of face masks. That’s what the Qualcomm Institute at the
University of California, San Diego is attempting to do. “Improvised visors
with some 3D-printed parts seem the most feasible,” say engineer Ramesh Rao,
the institute’s director. </p>



<h4>Get creative </h4>



<p>In response to the <em>JAMA</em>
editorial’s call for ideas, several health care workers suggested scuba masks.
They’re durable enough to be sterilized, they protect the eyes, nose and mouth,
and best of all, they channel air through a small tube that a filter can be
placed in. “Why not?” Livingston says. “It makes sense.” </p>



<p>Livingston and colleagues are digging through the ideas, talking with experts and hoping to update people with guidance soon. But for now, “I don’t think anyone can say what’s right or wrong,” he says. “People need to do their best.”</p>

<p>A suspected subsurface ocean
on Pluto might be old and deep. </p>



<p>New analyses of images from NASA’s
New Horizons spacecraft suggest that the dwarf planet has had an underground
ocean since shortly after Pluto formed 4.5 billion years ago, and that the ocean
may surround and interact with the rocky core.</p>



<p>If so, oceans could be
common at the solar system’s edge — and may even be able to support life. That
possibly “transforms the way we think about the Kuiper Belt,” the region of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-dust-earth-atmosphere-nasa-labs-right-now">icy objects beyond the orbit of Neptune</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/19</em>), says planetary scientist Adeene
Denton of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. </p>



<p>On its pass through the
Kuiper Belt in 2015, New Horizons revealed that despite the dwarf planet’s location
nearly 6 billion kilometers from the sun, Pluto showed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/salty-sea-could-lurk-beneath-heart-pluto">signs of hosting an ocean</a> of liquid water beneath an icy shell (<em>SN: 9/23/16</em>).
</p>



<p>How much liquid may lie
beneath Pluto’s ground, how long it’s been there, and how much the water may
have partially frozen over time is hard to tell from the surface. The new
research, which had been scheduled for presentation the week of March 16 at the
canceled <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1497.pdf">Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</a> in The Woodlands, Texas, has dug into those questions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Pluto's surface" class="wp-image-3086289" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032020_lg_pluto_inline1_map_rev.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086289">Dark lines (circled) on the surface of Pluto, shown in this image from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, could mark ripples created when a large object probably slammed into the opposite side of the dwarf planet.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086289">New Horizons Team</span></figure>



<p>“If there’s an ocean today,
it raises the question of, when did that ocean get there?” says planetary scientist
Carver Bierson of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>Bierson considered two
possible histories for Pluto’s potential ocean. If the dwarf planet had a “cold
start,” any subsurface water would first have been frozen before melting under heat
from decaying radioactive elements in the dwarf planet’s core, only to
partially freeze again over time. In that scenario, Bierson expected to see
cracks and ripples across Pluto’s icy shell from the orb’s contraction as the
ice melted and then expansion as water refroze. Contracting would make the ice
crumple into mountainlike features, while expanding would stretch the ice and
create faults and graben. </p>





<p>Bierson’s second scenario
envisioned a “warm start” for Pluto, where the ocean would have been liquid for
nearly all of Pluto’s 4.5-billion-year existence. In that case, the surface
would show only cracks from the sea expanding as it partially froze. And that’s
exactly what Bierson and colleagues found in New Horizon’s images, suggesting that
Pluto’s liquid ocean is nearly as old as the dwarf planet itself.  </p>



<p>“That means maybe Pluto did
start off warm,” Bierson says. “Maybe it started with a liquid ocean really
early on.” </p>





<p>In a separate study, Denton
and colleagues considered the impact that formed Sputnik Planitia, the left
lobe of Pluto’s distinctive heart-shaped basin. Because of how New Horizons
flew past Pluto, scientists’ view of half the dwarf planet is fuzzy. But the
team was able to see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08833">lines on Pluto’s surface on the exact opposite side of
the globe from Sputnik Planitia</a>, the researchers
reported in October 2019 at arXiv.org. Those
lines might be the imprints of shock waves from a massive impact that formed the
enormous basin, Denton says.</p>



<p>“If the impact is large
enough … the planet itself can act like a lens, and focus the wave energy at
the exact opposite point on the planet from the impact,” she says.</p>



<p>Pluto’s internal structure
would have controlled how those shock waves shuddered through the dwarf planet.
Looking at the cracks in the surface ice could give clues to the thickness of
the proposed ocean or the core’s chemical makeup. So Denton and her colleagues ran
computer simulations of an impact to look for clues. </p>



<p>“We got the fun answer,” she
says. To explain the lines seen on the dwarf planet, not only would Pluto need
a large ocean, 150 kilometers or more in thickness, but the core must contain
minerals, such as serpentine, that form through interactions between rock and
water. Astrobiologists think that water-rock interactions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-salt-may-stripe-europas-surface">could provide energy and nutrients for life</a> (<em>SN: 5/19/15</em>). The possibility of a somewhat soggy
core could let life get a toehold at the fringes of the solar system, Denton
says.</p>



<p>“It’s certainly not exactly
a smoking gun,” she says. “But it’s exciting.”</p>



<p>The possibility that Pluto
has a habitable ocean raises the odds that other Kuiper Belt objects do too,
says planetary scientist James Tuttle Keene of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif., who is a member of the New Horizons team but was not
involved in either study.  </p>



<p>“This lays out one of the
coolest hypotheses that a future Pluto mission could test,” he says. “If Pluto
can have an ocean and potentially be habitable, it’s very likely that other
bodies in the Kuiper Belt also are ocean worlds and also are potentially
habitable.”</p>

Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227">rate of TOLAC is decreasing</a>, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">risk of uterine rupture</a> is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.</p>
<p>We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> showed promising results.</p>
<h3><strong>Our criteria</strong></h3>
<p>Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1. Criteria for TOLAC in this study<br />

</table>
<p>We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.</p>
<h3><strong>High success rate</strong></h3>
<p>Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).</p>
<blockquote><p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors associated with failed TOLAC</strong></h3>
<p>This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.</p>
<p>Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267">risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes</a> in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.</p>

<p>Pangolins can harbor
coronaviruses related to the new coronavirus, a study finds. </p>



<p>Scientists studied
viruses in pangolins (<em>Manis
javanica</em>)
captured in anti-smuggling activities in southern China. The identified
coronaviruses, however, are different enough from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes COVID-19, to hint that pangolins were not directly responsible for
transmitting the virus to people, which had been suggested.</p>



<p>One of the pangolin viruses does have a structure that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2169-0">closely resembles the new coronavirus’ spike protein</a>, which allows the pathogen to get into cells, infectious disease researcher Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam of the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong and colleagues report March 26 in <em>Nature</em>. </p>



<p>The closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 is still from a bat, the only other known mammal found to be infected with similar coronaviruses. </p>

</aside>



<p>The new coronavirus’ similarity to both a bat virus and a pangolin virus suggests that viruses from the two animals may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature">exchanged genes</a> at some point before infecting people (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). The pangolin viruses, however, lack a feature seen in SARS-CoV-2 that may have helped the virus make the leap to humans — a hint that the virus may have acquired an adaptation in another, not yet identified, animal before spreading around the globe.  </p>



<p>Pangolins, while perhaps not directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 jumping to humans, should be handled carefully to prevent the viruses they carry from infecting people, the team writes. The animals are the most illegally trafficked mammal, used both as food and in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<p>Surf’s up, Neandertals.</p>



<p>Our close evolutionary cousins obtained shellfish, crabs,
fish and other marine munchies along Europe’s Atlantic coast with all the savvy
and gusto of ancient humans who foraged along southern Africa’s shoreline, say
archaeologist João Zilhão of the University of Barcelona and
his colleagues.</p>



<p>Neandertals consumed a diverse menu of sea and land foods
while occupying Figueira Brava cave, on Portugal’s coast, for extended periods
between around 106,000 and 86,000 years ago, Zilhão’s group says. Excavations there
show for the first time that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7943">Neandertals
matched Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em></a> in
their ability to exploit seafood rich in brain-enhancing fatty acids, the
scientists report in the March 27  <em>Science</em>. This discovery adds to controversial
evidence that Neandertals engaged in various behaviors traditionally thought to
have characterized only <em>H. sapiens</em>,
such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dating-questions-challenge-whether-neandertals-drew-spanish-cave-art">creating
cave art</a> and elaborate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cache-eagle-claws-points-neandertal-jewelry-making">personal
ornaments</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/19; SN: 3/20/15</em>).</p>



<p>Extensive seaside activity at Figueira Brava also expands on
preliminary evidence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-dove-harvested-clamshells-tools-near-italy-shores">Neandertal
clamshell collecting</a> on the beach and in shallow Mediterranean waters (<em>SN: 1/15/20</em>). Other excavations had suggested
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-seafood-fans">Neandertals
occasionally gathered shellfish</a> and hunted or scavenged sea animals
starting around 110,000 years ago (<em>SN:
9/22/08</em>).</p>





<p>But repeated bouts of Neandertal foraging at Figueira Brava
over a roughly 20,000-year span point to coastal activity as extensive as that
of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-edge-ancestors"><em>H. sapiens</em> who harvested shellfish</a>
at South Africa’s Pinnacle Point between 164,000 and 120,000 years ago, Zilhão
says (<em>SN: 7/29/11</em>). </p>



<p>Intensive shellfish collecting requires tracking of the
tides and the seasons, “certainly one of the hallmarks of behavioral
adaptability of early Neandertals [in Europe] and modern humans in South
Africa,” says archaeologist Katerina Douka of the Max Planck Institute for the
Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. She did not participate in the new
study.</p>



<p>Zilhão regards Neandertals as an ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> variant that developed in Europe and Asia, not a
separate species as they are often portrayed. “The early <em>H. sapiens</em> of Europe, people whom we came to know as Neandertals,
exploited marine resources at least as intensively as, if not more intensively
than, [Stone Age] South Africans living in comparable habitats and
circumstances,” he says.</p>



<p>Figueira Brava lies on the 20-kilometer-long coastline of Arrábida,
a mountain range 30 kilometers south of Lisbon. It’s the only place on Europe’s
Atlantic coast where present-day shorelines and ancient, now-underwater
shorelines are short distances apart, Zilhão says. So only here would
Neandertals have caught seafood and brought it back to nearby caves such as
Figueira Brava, rather than immediately eating what they had caught before
making a long trek inland. </p>



<p>Excavations from 2010 to 2013 unearthed a range of seafood remains
from a time when Neandertals, but not <em>H.
sapiens</em>, inhabited Europe. Chemical analyses of Figueira Brava sediments
and mineral formations provided age estimates for Neandertal activity.</p>



<p>Menu items included mussels, limpets, eels and even sharks,
which could have been caught in shallow water or when trapped in large rock
pools by ebbing tides. Other foods eaten by Figueira Brava Neandertals included
tortoises, seals, ducks, geese, red deer, horse, ibex (a kind of wild goat),
now-extinct wild cattle called aurochs and pine nuts. Numerous stone tools and
toolmaking debris were also found. Burned pieces of wood in excavated sediment
came from intentionally lit fires, probably used for cooking, warmth or both, the
researchers say.</p>

Zilhão <em>et al./Science</em> 2020</span></figure>



<p>Discoveries at Figueira Brava challenge past assertions that
Neandertals’ seaside visits were rare and unplanned, says evolutionary
ecologist Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar National Museum, who was not part of
the excavation team. “Neandertals were every bit human,” he adds, echoing Zilhão’s
argument.</p>



<p>But archaeologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen
in Germany disagrees. “The new study <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb3568">narrows
the gap</a> between <em>H. sapiens</em> and
[Neandertals], but does not close it,” he writes in a commentary published in the
same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Taking into account nearly 60 coastal sites occupied either
by Neandertals or <em>H. sapiens</em> between
around 300,000 and 40,000 years ago, <em>H.
sapiens</em> more intensively exploited coastal resources, Will says. For
instance, shell beads, a demanding ornament to make, have mainly been found at <em>H. sapiens</em> sites.</p>



<p>But shell beads are not signs of intensive seafood consumption, Zilhão responds. Klasies River, a <em>H. sapiens</em> coastal site in South Africa that’s especially rich in shellfish remains, has not yielded a single shell bead, he says. The key point is that the density and diversity of Neandertals’ seafood at Figueira Brava equals or exceeds that at South African <em>H. sapiens</em> sites.</p>

<p>Glowing
X-rays around distant galaxies can’t come from dark matter particles, new
research shows. The mysterious glow <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaw3772">failed to show up in the dark matter
halo around the Milky Way</a>, astrophysicists report in the March 27 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It seems to be the final
nail in the coffin of the dark matter interpretation,” says astroparticle physicist
Ben Safdi of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. </p>



<p>The tantalizing glows were first
detected in 2014 as an <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/13">excess of X-rays with an energy of 3.5 kiloelectron volts</a>, or keV, coming from faraway galaxy clusters. Some
astronomers argued that the X-rays could come from decaying particles of dark
matter — the ubiquitous, inert material that makes up more than 80 percent of
the universe’s matter. The X-rays’ energy, in particular, suggested that the
light could be coming from hypothetical dark matter particles called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-neutrino-surplus-hints-existence-new-particles">sterile neutrinos</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>). </p>



<p>But searches for a similar
X-ray glows came up empty in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-grows-over-whether-x-rays-are-sign-dark-matter">dwarf galaxy Draco</a> in 2015 (<em>SN: 12/11/15</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-candidate-particles-are-no-show-hitomi-data">the Perseus galaxy cluster</a> in 2016 (<em>SN: 8/12/16</em>). So Safdi and his
colleagues looked closer to home. The Milky Way’s starry spiral disk is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size">surrounded by a halo of dark matter</a> (<em>SN: 3/23/20</em>). If the X-rays come from
decaying dark matter, our galaxy’s halo should sparkle with the light.</p>



<p>All images of the sky look
through some portion of the Milky Way’s dark matter halo, even if that’s not
what a telescope is aiming at. So the researchers sifted through every
observation that the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope ever
made, about 347 days of total exposure time, in search of X-rays at the right
energy. The team saw none.</p>



<p>“The jury is still out on
what is producing the 3.5 keV” signal, Safdi says. “What’s clear, though, is
it’s not dark matter.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.</p>
<p>Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.</p>
<p>A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11795 aligncenter" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg" width="620" />
<p>Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.</p>
<p>School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.</p>

<p>A wolf-sized warrior, kin to
the fierce, feathered <em>Velociraptor</em>, prowled what is now New Mexico about
68 million years ago. </p>



<p><em>Dineobellator notohesperus</em> was a dromaeosaur, a group of swift, agile predators
that is distantly related to the much larger <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>. The
discovery of this new species suggests that dromaeosaurs were still <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61480-7">diversifying, and even becoming better at pursuing
prey</a>, right up to the end of the Age
of Dinosaurs, researchers say March 26 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>That age came to an abrupt close
at the end of the Cretaceous Period about 66 million years ago, when a mass
extinction event wiped out all nonbird dinosaurs. A gap in the global fossil
record for dromaeosaurs near the end of the Cretaceous had led some scientists
to wonder <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clearer-picture-emerging-dinosaurs-last-days">whether the group was already in decline</a> before the extinction, says Steven Jasinski, a
paleontologist at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg (<em>SN:
4/21/16</em>). The new find suggests otherwise. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="D. notohesperus skeleton" class="wp-image-3086400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032520_cg_dino_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086400">A skeletal reconstruction of <em>D. notohesperus</em> shows that the dromaeosaur, one of a group of agile predators, was about the size of a modern wolf.

Jasinski</span></figure>



<p>Since 2008, Jasinski and his
colleagues have recovered more than 20 fossilized pieces of the new species from
the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness, a rapidly eroding region of barren badlands in
northwestern New Mexico. Analyses of muscle attachment sites on the fossilized
forelimbs suggest the dinosaur was unusually strong for a dromaeosaur, with a
very tight grip in its hands and feet. That grip, Jasinski says, was likely
stronger than that of its
famous kinfolk, <em>Velociraptor</em> and <em>Utahraptor</em>, giving the new
species extra weaponry in its pursuit of prey. </p>



<p>Like many other dromaeosaurs,
<em>D. notohesperus</em> had feathers, evidenced by the presence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bumpy-bones-fossil-hints-dinosaur-had-feathery-forearms">quill nobs</a> —
bumps indicating where the feathers were attached — on its limbs (<em>SN:
9/19/07</em>). But, like <em>Velociraptor</em>, it probably used the feathers for purposes
other than flight, Jasinski says, such as sexual selection, camouflage or added
agility while on the hunt. </p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The world is currently in an unprecedented state of upheaval and uncertainty. As countries fight to minimise the spread of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the “new normal”, remaining at home and practising social distancing. And the same is true of the psychologists whose work we report on every day at <em>Research Digest</em>: labs have been shut and experiments have suddenly been put on hold in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But many psychologists have also begun launching new research to understand how the present crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. So this week, I’ve been talking to some of these researchers to find out more about their work.<span id="more-39388"></span></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring our mental health</strong></p>
<p>It’s clear that the new routines that we are now following are going to be necessary for quite some time. A new study led by social epidemiologist Daisy Fancourt is asking how people are responding to these changes in lifestyle.</p>
<p>We already know that our mental health can be affected by isolation, says Fancourt, and there’s never been a situation where so many people have been required to remain physically separated from others. “We’ve not really had something like this in living history,” she says.</p>
<p>To that end, the team is examining the trajectories of people’s mental health during the pandemic — and investigating what kinds of activities can help protect against the negative effects of isolation. Any UK resident over 18 can <a href="https://redcap.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=TTXKND8JMK">sign-up online</a> and fill in an initial, 10 minute survey. Then, once a week, they will automatically get sent a follow-up questionnaire asking about their experiences of COVID-19, how they’ve been spending their time, and their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>By tracking a large number of participants over time, the team hopes to figure out what people can do at home to protect their mental health. They will release the findings regularly to the public and to the government and health authorities, beginning from next week. And they’re in it for the long haul, says Fancourt. “As long as this pandemic is going on, and we’re having these isolation measures, we want to make sure that there is a way that we’re tracking the experiences of people.”</p>
<p>Fancourt emphasises that it is crucial that people stay home — doing so will save lives. And there are activities known to be good for our mental health that we can already be doing, she adds: practising music and arts, for instance, or volunteering and providing support for others in the community.</p>
<p>Amy Orben from the University of Cambridge is part of another team planning a large, year-long study tracking the responses of adolescents and adults during the pandemic. The researchers, who are currently in discussion with funders, plan on tracking participants’ mood and mental health through the use of an app, which will send questions to their phones on a regular basis. Importantly, this app will also record behavioural data: what other apps people are using, for instance, and how long they are spending on their phones, as well as their movement and sleep patterns.</p>
<p>As in Fancourt’s study, the researchers hope the work will untangle how people’s activities relate to their mental health. They also plan on looking at how any events and announcements related to the pandemic affect participants’ responses. Orben says the team is keen to rapidly share data with the research community so that it can be analysed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For Orben, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media use</a>, one of the key questions will be how technology is being utilised in a time where face-to-face interaction is extremely limited. “I think it will allow us to move away from just thinking about time spent online and on screens to having more nuanced conversations about … what activities on screens are people actually engaging in,” she says. “Which ones of those are beneficial and help mitigate the effects of social isolation, and which ones might actually exacerbate stress?”</p>
<p><strong>Exploring messaging and behaviour </strong></p>
<p>Some researchers have already conducted preliminary research and published the results — as preprints, at least. Many of these studies have attempted to examine the value of different forms of public health messaging, or determine how people are behaving during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Take a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/9yqs8">recent preprint</a> which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans across two days in March. The team, led by Jim Everett at the University of Kent and Molly Crocket at Yale University, looked at how moral messages could promote public health behaviours. Participants read a Facebook post urging people to stay at home, which was either accompanied by a “deontological” argument, telling people it was their duty to protect their community; a “utilitarian” argument, asking people to think of the negative consequences of not making these sacrifices now; an appeal to virtue, reminding people that staying home is what a good person would do; or no moral argument. They then indicated how likely they would be to adopt public health-related behaviours like washing their hands after getting home, or avoiding public gatherings.</p>
<p>Participants were more likely to indicate they would share the deontological message — the one that appealed to their sense of duty — than a post with no moral argument or a virtue-based one.  And there was some evidence that the deontological argument might increase people’s intentions to engage in health-related behaviours: participants reported a stronger intention to wash their hands after reading this message compared to the virtue-based one, for instance, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>The study suggests that messages focused on citizens’ duties and responsibilities to others may be particularly useful. But the work is preliminary and there are important caveats: it only looks at people’s <em>intentions</em> rather than actual behaviour, and the effects are small and are not always significant. “What we’re very much <em>not</em> suggesting is that framing these judgments in more ‘deontological’ ways is unequivocally going to have huge impacts on behaviour,” acknowledges Everett. But still, the findings are consistent with past work, he says, adding that even interventions that produce small changes could, together, have an impact in the pandemic. The team is now working with other groups to see whether similar effects are found outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at how differences in personalities influence how likely we are to accept constraints to our quality of life (like social isolation) in order to protect ourselves or others from the virus. Ingo Zettler and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/pkm2a/">have posted a preprint</a> based on a survey of 799 Danish citizens who completed personality questionnaires. Participants who scored higher on the so-called “Dark Factor” — which relates to people’s willingness to pursue their own interests at the expense of others — were less likely to accept these constraints. In contrast, those who scored higher on the trait of emotionality, who tend to be more anxious and empathetic, were more likely to follow them.</p>
<p>Other rapid studies have included research into <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/dz428">Americans’ perceptions of risk and behaviours</a> early on in the pandemic, how <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/y2cg5/">empathy relates to social distancing</a>, and the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/epcyb/">“optimism bias”</a> when people consider the chance they will contract or pass on the virus. Again, it’s important to point out that most of this research consists of preprints which have not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Proceeding quickly… </strong></p>
<p>These studies represent just a snapshot of the work psychologists are conducting in the midst of the current crisis. J Nathan Matias from Cornell University and Alex Leavitt from Facebook Research have set up the <a href="https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research">COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker</a>, in which researchers can record details of projects they are working on. As of 26<sup>th</sup> March, more than 100 projects are listed, on everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the effects of remote teaching on education.</p>
<p>The aim of the list is to help researchers who are planning studies find ways of working together and determine where they should be channelling their efforts, says Matias. The tracker will also ensure people are aware of new results as they become available.</p>
<p>Other networks are also getting involved in the response. The Psychological Science Accelerator, a network of labs which collaborate on large-scale studies, recently <a href="https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/21/join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project/">put out a call for “rapid and impactful studies”</a> to understand the psychological side of the pandemic. The group has decided to go ahead with three of the proposals, including a study that will examine the behavioural benefits of framing public health information in terms of gains (e.g. lives saved) rather than losses (e.g. deaths). Several journals have also joined <a href="http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html">an initiative calling for submissions of Registered Reports</a> on research related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>…<strong> but with caution</strong></p>
<p>While researchers conduct rapid research and stick preprints online, there’s another key effort that scientists can get involved in, says Matias: peer-review. “As we move quickly to organise the production of new knowledge, we absolutely need people who can take the time to look through those preprints … and get us to the point of verified knowledge in time for it to be useful,” he says. Orben echoes these concerns: “Just because things are urgent doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be scrutinised.” That scrutiny itself will need to become more instantaneous, she adds. Many journals, including the <em><a href="https://twitter.com/lauragesmith/status/1240712219731558402/photo/1">British Journal of Social Psychology</a> </em>and the <a href="https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1242892821629153280?s=20"><em>British Journal of Health Psychology</em></a> are already promising expedited peer review of papers related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some psychologists have stressed that it’s also important this rapid response is informed by past work, whether that consists of studies into outbreaks specifically, or just well-grounded psychological science more generally. “The first rule of preventing harm is learning from what’s been done before,” <a href="https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20">tweeted Vaughan Bell recently</a>. “If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right”.</p>
<p>And although many researchers are able to conduct psychological research in the midst of a pandemic, Matias emphasises that not everyone is in a position to do so.  “A lot of people have been impacted themselves in ways that make it difficult to continue research. And that’s okay,” he says.</p>
<p>For those who do have the time or means to do so, however, it can be rewarding. “It’s easy to feel quite helpless at the moment,” says Everett. “I’m really glad I’m doing it – it makes me feel like I am perhaps able to contribute in some small part”.</p>

<p>Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cocites.com/">CoCites</a> was developed by Janssens et al. at <a href="http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html">Emory University</a>. Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.</p>

<p>People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11777" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg" width="300" />of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.</p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic circling the
globe is caused by a natural virus, not one made in a lab, a new study says. </p>



<p>The virus’s genetic makeup reveals that
SARS-CoV-2 isn’t a mishmash of known viruses, as might be expected if it were
human-made. And it has unusual features that have only recently been identified
in scaly anteaters called pangolins, evidence that the virus came from nature,
Kristian Andersen and his colleagues report March 17 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>When Andersen, an infectious disease
researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., first heard
about the coronavirus causing an outbreak in China, he wondered where the virus
came from. Initially, researchers thought the virus was being spread by
repeated infections jumping from animals in a seafood market in Wuhan, China,
into humans and then being passed person to person. Analysis from other
researchers has since suggested that the virus probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread">jumped
only once from an animal into a person</a> and has been spread human to human
since about mid-November (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>But shortly after the virus’s genetic
makeup was revealed in early January, rumors began bubbling up that maybe the
virus was engineered in a lab and either intentionally or accidentally
released. </p>





<p>An unfortunate coincidence fueled
conspiracy theorists, says Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University in
New Orleans. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is “in very close proximity to”
the seafood market, and has conducted research on viruses, including
coronaviruses, found in bats that have potential to cause disease in people. “That
led people to think that, oh, it escaped and went down the sewers, or somebody
walked out of their lab and went over to the market or something,” Garry says.</p>



<p>Accidental releases of viruses,
including SARS, have happened from other labs in the past. So “this is not
something you can just dismiss out of hand,” Andersen says. “That would be
foolish.”</p>



<h4>Looking for clues</h4>



<p>Andersen assembled a team of
evolutionary biologists and virologists, including Garry, from several
countries to analyze the virus for clues that it could have been human-made, or
grown in and accidentally released from a lab.</p>



<p>“We said, ‘Let’s take this theory — of
which there are multiple different versions — that the virus has a non-natural
origin … as a serious potential hypothesis,’ ” Andersen says.</p>



<p>Meeting via Slack and other virtual
portals, the researchers analyzed the virus’s genetic makeup, or RNA sequence,
for clues about its origin. </p>



<p>It was clear “almost overnight” that the
virus wasn’t human-made, Andersen says. Anyone hoping to create a virus would
need to work with already known viruses and engineer them to have desired
properties. </p>



<p>But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has components
that differ from those of previously known viruses, so they had to come from an
unknown virus or viruses in nature. “Genetic data irrefutably show that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">SARS-CoV-2 is not
derived</a> from any previously used virus backbone,” Andersen and colleagues write
in the study.</p>



<p>“This is not a virus somebody would have conceived
of and cobbled together. It has too many distinct features, some of which are
counterintuitive,” Garry says. “You wouldn’t do this if you were trying to make
a more deadly virus.” </p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Other scientists agree. “We see absolutely no
evidence that the virus has been engineered or purposely released,” says Emma
Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland.
She was not part of Andersen’s group, but is a member of a team of scientists
with <a href="https://nextstrain.org/">Nextstrain.org</a> that is tracking
small genetic changes in the coronavirus to learn more about how it is
spreading around the world. </p>



<p>That finding debunks a widely disputed analysis,
posted at bioRxiv.org before peer review, that claimed to find bits of HIV in
the coronavirus, Hodcroft says. Other scientists quickly pointed out flaws in
the study and the authors retracted the report, but not before it fueled the
notion that the virus was engineered.</p>



<p>Some stretches of the virus’s genetic material are
similar to HIV, but that’s something that stems from those viruses sharing a
common ancestor during evolution, Hodcroft says. “Essentially their claim was
the same as me taking a copy of the<em> Odyssey</em>
and saying, ‘Oh, this has the word <em>the</em>
in it,’ and then opening another book, seeing the word <em>the</em> in it and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s the same word, there must
be parts of the <em>Odyssey</em> in this other
book,” she says. “It was a really misleading claim and really bad science.”</p>



<h4>Finding peculiar features</h4>



<p>Andersen’s group next set out to determine whether
the virus could have been accidentally released from a lab. That’s a real
possibility because researchers in many places are working with coronaviruses
that have potential to infect humans, he says. “Stuff comes out of the lab
sometimes, almost always accidentally,” he says. </p>



<p>A couple of unexpected features of the virus
caught the researchers’ eyes, Andersen says. In particular, the gene encoding
the coronavirus’s spike protein has 12 extra RNA building blocks, or
nucleotides, stuck in it. </p>



<p>This spike protein protrudes from the virus’
surface and allows the virus to latch onto and enter human cells. That
insertion of RNA building blocks adds four amino acids to the spike protein,
and creates a site in the protein for an enzyme called furin to cut. Furin is
made in human cells, and cleaves proteins only at spots where a particular
combination of amino acids is found, like the one created by the insertion. SARS
and other SARS-like viruses don’t have those cutting sites.</p>





<p>Finding the furin cutting site was a
surprise: “That was an aha moment and an uh-oh moment,” Garry says. When bird
influenza viruses acquire the ability to be cut by furin, the viruses often
become more easily transmissible. The insertion also created places where sugar
molecules could be fastened to the spike protein, creating a shield to protect the
virus from the immune system.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 virus’ spike protein also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs">binds
more tightly</a> to a protein on human cells called ACE2 than SARS does (<em>SN: 3/10/20</em>). Tighter binding may allow SARS-CoV-2
to more easily infect cells. Together, those features may account for why
COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">so
contagious</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s very peculiar, these two
features,” Andersen says. “How do we explain how this came about?  I’ve got to be honest. I was skeptical [that
it was natural]. This could have happened in tissue culture” in a lab, where
viruses may acquire mutations as they replicate many times in lab dishes. In
nature, viruses carrying some of those mutations might be weeded out by natural
selection but might persist in lab dishes where even feeble viruses don’t have
to fight hard for survival. </p>



<h4>Clinching the case for nature</h4>



<p>But then the researchers compared SARS-CoV-2 with other
coronaviruses recently found in nature, including in bats and pangolins. “It
looks like SARS-CoV-2 could be a mix of bat and pangolin viruses,” Garry says. </p>



<p>Viruses, especially RNA viruses such as
coronaviruses, often swap genes in nature. Finding genes related to the
pangolin viruses was especially reassuring because those viruses’ genetic
makeup wasn’t known until after SARS-CoV-2’s discovery, making it unlikely
anyone was working with them in a lab, he says. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="pangolin" class="wp-image-3086389" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/031920_ts_covid-conspiracies_inline_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086389">Coronaviruses that infect pangolins gave researchers important clues that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is natural.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086389">2630ben/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figure>



<p>In particular, pangolins also have the amino acids
that cause the tight binding of the spike protein to ACE2, the team found. “So
clearly, this is something that can happen in nature,” Andersen says. “I
thought that was very important little clue. It shows there’s no mystery about
its tighter binding to the human [protein] because pangolins do it, too.”</p>



<p>The sugar-attachment sites were another clue that
the virus is natural, Andersen says. The sugars create a “mucin shield” that
protects the virus from an immune system attack. But lab tissue culture dishes
don’t have immune systems, making it unlikely that such an adaptation would
arise from growing the virus in a lab. “That sort of explained away the tissue-culture
hypothesis,” he says.</p>



<p>Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat and pangolin viruses is some of the best evidence that the virus is natural, Hodcroft says. “This was just another animal spillover into humans,” she says. “It’s really the most simple explanation for what we see.” Researchers still aren’t sure exactly which animal was the source.</p>



<p>Andersen says the analysis probably won’t lay conspiracy theories to rest. Still, he thinks the analysis was worth doing. “I was myself skeptical at the beginning and I kept flipping back and forth,” Andersen says, but he’s now convinced. “All the data show it’s natural.” </p>

<p>Squid can edit their
genetic information in a place scientists didn’t expect.</p>



<p>Longfin inshore squid (<em>Doryteuthis pealeii</em>) are the first known
animals that can tweak strings of RNA outside of a nerve cell’s nucleus. These
genetic couriers, called messenger RNA, or mRNA, carry a cell’s blueprints for
building proteins. </p>



<p>All creatures make edits
to RNA —
including other types besides mRNA — and do so sparingly, based on limited
studies in mammals and fruit flies.
Those changes typically take place inside the nucleus and are then exported to
the rest of the cell. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa172/5809668">squids’ ability to make genetic edits in
cytoplasm</a>, the jellylike
material that makes up much of a cell, may let the animals make adjustments to
mRNAs on the fly. That skill could help squids produce proteins tailored to meet a cell’s
needs and hone crucial cell processes, researchers
report March 23 in <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>. </p>





<p>Knowing how the squids make the edits in nerve cells could help
researchers hijack the technique to develop therapeutics for health conditions
such as chronic pain by genetically editing cells that create inappropriate
pain signals, says Joshua Rosenthal, a biologist at the Marine Biological
Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. The method would be much like the DNA-editing
technique CRISPR, but for RNA.</p>



<p>In the new study, Rosenthal and colleagues first looked at where an
mRNA-editing protein is found in squid nerve cells, or neurons. The team discovered
that the protein, called ADAR2, is located in both the jellylike cytoplasm and the
nucleus of squid neurons, a hint that the protein could edit mRNAs in both
areas. </p>



<p>The team then extracted cytoplasm from squid axons — the slender
stalk of a neuron — “kind of like you’re squeezing toothpaste out of the tube,”
Rosenthal says. ADAR2 extensively edited an mRNA within the cytoplasm siphoned
from the axons, which help send electrical impulses along nerve cells, the
researchers found.</p>



<p>Developing an RNA-editing technique similar to CRISPR could come
with key advantages.  While
CRISPR-generated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-crispr-gene-editors-can-fix-rna-and-dna-one-typo-time">edits in DNA are permanent</a>, RNA is transient,
and edited genetic information would disappear when the RNA is broken down in
the cell (<em>SN: 10/25/17</em>). </p>



<p>“There are a lot of advantages for trying to manipulate genetic
information in RNA,” Rosenthal says. “If you make a mistake, it’s not nearly so
dangerous. If you make mistakes in DNA, you’re stuck with it.” </p>

<p>Signs of a cultural shift in toolmaking and lifestyles sparked
by farming, previously found at ancient Asian and European sites, have surfaced
for the first time on New Guinea.</p>



<p>Excavations at a highland site called Waim <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/13/eaay45733">produced relics of a cultural transition to village life</a>, which played out on the remote island north of Australia around 5,050 to 4,200 years ago. Archaeologist Ben Shaw of the University of New South Wales in Sydney and colleagues report the findings March 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>. </p>



<p>Agriculture on New Guinea originated in the island’s highlands
an estimated 8,000 to 4,000 years ago. But corresponding cultural changes, such
as living in villages and making elaborate ritual and symbolic objects, have
often been assumed to have emerged only when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-pottery-maps-route-south-pacific">Lapita
farmers from Southeast Asia</a> reached New Guinea around 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 9/2/15</em>). In Asia and Europe, those
cultural changes mark the beginning of the Neolithic period. The new finds
suggest that a Neolithic period also independently developed in New Guinea.</p>



<p>Key finds at Waim consist of a piece of a carved human or
animal face that probably had symbolic meaning and two stone pestles bearing
traces of yam, fruit and nut starches.</p>



<p>Other discoveries include a stone cutting or chopping tool, a
pigment-stained stone with deep incisions that may have been used to apply
coloring to plant fibers and an iron-rich rock fragment that was likely struck
with other stones to create sparks for igniting fires.</p>



<p>Farming’s rise on New Guinea apparently inspired
long-distance, seagoing trade, the scientists say. Chemical analysis of an unearthed
chunk of obsidian — displaying marks created when someone hammered off sharp
flakes — indicates it was imported from an island located at least 800
kilometers away.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>You’ll probably be familiar with the idea of behavioural “nudges” — interventions that encourage people to make better choices, without changing the actual options available. As a concept, nudging has become hugely popular, with at least 200 “nudge units” in governments and institutions around the world. We’ve certainly reported on a few studies finding that simple nudges <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/">encourage people to give more to charity</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/">help people to make healthier soft drink choices from fast food menus</a>, for example. You might be forgiven for thinking, then, that there are no limits to what nudging can do….</p>
<p>Well, a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z">set of studies</a> designed to “nudge” commuters’ behaviour, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour </em>and involving a total of almost 69,000 people, has found that there definitely are limits. “The failure of these well-powered experiments … highlights both the difficulty of changing commuter behaviour and the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge about how to encourage sustainable travel,” write Ariella S. Kristal and Ashley V. Whillans, of Harvard Business School.</p>
<p><span id="more-39383"></span></p>
<p>The participants were employees of a major European airport. About half had reported driving by themselves to and from work. But almost 60% of this group said they would consider carpooling, and 41% said that finding a “matched” person with a similar commute to carpool with was a key reason why they weren’t already doing it. Many employees also reported that if they were given discounts on public transport, they’d be more likely to use it. The airport did already have a carpool service, and was also well connected to subway, rail and bus infrastructure. It seemed, then, like the ideal place to nudge people towards commuter behaviours that would benefit their own health and pocket, as well as, of course, the environment.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, Kristal and Whillans tested a letter and email campaign designed to encourage employees to sign up for carpooling by highlighting the benefits and providing testimonials from carpoolers. Though this intervention did increase registrants, this increase was tiny, and, statistically, it made absolutely no difference to the numbers who actually used the service. (For this study, the researchers sent out 15,000 letters. Only 33 employees registered for the service as a result. One month later, only three who’d received the initial letter were active carpoolers.)</p>
<p>For the second study, they gave employees details of good personal carpooling matches, and reminded them that carpooling would save them money. (Remember, a lack of knowledge about someone suitable to carpool with was reported in initial surveys as a key barrier to doing it.) But  again, this intervention did not increase carpooling behaviour.</p>
<p>Next, they tried giving a different group of more than 7,000 employees a free one-week bus trial. But this intervention failed to subsequently increase registration for discounted bus passes.</p>
<p>In the fourth experiment, the pair provided just over 1,000 employees with comprehensive personalised travel plans. These plans included information about carpooling matches, bus and train routes and times, transit pass discounts and bike routes. These employees were also offered a one-on-one session with the airport commuter team to talk this through. Only 21 people signed up for these sessions. And, overall, the intervention made no difference whatsoever to the participants’ commuter behaviour.</p>
<p>There is one significant limitation to the study that the researchers themselves point out: this particular airport offers employees a free parking space. Perhaps these attempted nudges would have had more impact on people who have to pay for their parking.</p>
<p>However, they do draw a few cautionary conclusions from their findings. One: the work “suggests that people do not always reveal their true intentions or barriers to sustainable commuting.” Though many had initially said that they <em>would</em> carpool or use public transport if they had discounted travel, this isn’t what transpired. Further work will be needed to investigate exactly why this is (maybe they don’t really want to talk to co-workers during the commute, for example). But it does seem that nudges aren’t enough to change commuter behaviours. Heavier-handed policies, such as congestion charges and parking bans, may be necessary to bring about shifts in this type of behaviour, the researchers write.</p>
<p>More broadly, though, they think the findings also suggest that nudges might not be that effective at changing habitual behaviours, in general.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0832-y">editorial</a> in the journal welcomes the publication of this paper. Though the majority of studies reporting nudge interventions have found them to be successful, given the known problem of bias towards publishing positive results, “it’s possible that many more unsuccessful interventions exist but have never been reported,” the editorial observes. And clearly, this is an example of a case where null results have policy implications.</p>
<p>Finally, the editorial notes, “the study points to the limits of nudges and reminds us that they are not a panacea. While they can be a low-cost and simple way to shift many behaviours, it’s important to remember that not all behaviours are equally easy to shift.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-proteins-super-computer-fight-pandemic">You can help fight the coronavirus. All you need is a computer</a></h4>

<p>Staying
home isn’t the only way to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. </p>



<p>Hundreds
of thousands of volunteers have added their home computers to a vast network
that forms a virtual supercomputer called <a href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@home</a>. The Folding@home project, which uses
crowdsourced computing power to run simulations of proteins for researchers
studying diseases, announced in February that it would begin analyzing proteins
found in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread">the coronavirus behind the ongoing
pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).
These proteins are tools that help the virus infect human cells. Using computer
simulations, researchers are mapping the coronavirus’s proteins, in hopes of revealing
vulnerabilities that can be attacked with new drugs. </p>



<p>The more volunteers who donate their unused computing power to the effort, the faster the virtual supercomputer can work its magic. Since the project <a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/">announced its new focus</a> on the coronavirus, around 400,000 new volunteers had joined, as of March 19. By March 26, that number had swelled to around 700,000. The collective computing power of that legion of volunteers makes Folding@home by far the most powerful supercomputer in the world. </p>



<p><em>Science
News </em>spoke with
project leader Gregory Bowman, a biophysicist at Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis, about how the project works and how people can help. </p>







<h4>How do simulations help map coronavirus proteins?</h4>



<p>Researchers
have taken snapshots of the proteins of the coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2,
using techniques like X-ray crystallography and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-goes-3-d-snapshots-lifes-atomic-details">cryo-electron microscopy</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/17</em>). But proteins
don’t hold still, Bowman says. </p>



<p>“All the
atoms in the protein and [its surroundings] are continually pushing and pulling
on each other,” he says. “What we’re doing is modeling those physical
interactions in the computer.” Those simulations reveal the different shapes a protein’s
structure can take. </p>



<h4>What kinds of vulnerabilities are you looking for?</h4>



<p>“You
want a nice pocket on the surface of a protein where you can imagine this
little molecule that we design inserting into a groove,” Bowman says. But many
proteins, particularly those in viruses, have seemingly smooth surfaces, making
them hard to target. </p>



<p>Folding@home
simulations give scientists a chance to uncover what Bowman calls “cryptic
pockets” — potential docking sites for drugs that aren’t visible in still
images of the protein, but are revealed as the protein wriggles around in a computer
simulation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div> <br />The Folding@home project aims to simulate “every [coronavirus] protein we can build reasonable starting structures for,” Bowman says. “There’s already a number of proteins from the novel coronavirus” that researchers have imaged, such as the virus’s spike protein (shown), which helps it infect human cells. Folding@home is simulating coronavirus proteins like this one to search for drugs that could stop the virus.  </figure>



<h4>Has this worked for other viruses?</h4>



<p>“We
actually took one protein from the Ebola virus and ran simulations and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.940510v1.abstract">discovered one of these cryptic
pockets</a>,” Bowman
says. “Then we went and did the experiments to show that there really is a
small pocket, and if we stick a small molecule in there, it really can shut the
protein’s function off.” Likewise, a new drug molecule could be designed to
stick in the chemical cogs of a SARS-CoV-2 protein that renders the virus unable
to infect human cells.</p>



<h4>Why not just find an existing drug that works for the coronavirus? </h4>



<p>“That
would be amazing,” Bowman says. Developing new drugs can take years or even
decades, so researchers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs">investigating several existing
drugs</a>
— such as those
designed to fight hepatitis C, Ebola and malaria — as potential COVID-19
treatments (<em>SN: 3/10/20</em>). But “there’s no guarantees that these things
will work,” he says. For instance, antiviral drugs used to treat HIV that
initially looked promising <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial">showed no clear benefit for
coronavirus patients</a>
in a recent clinical trial (<em>SN: 3/19/20</em>). Efforts like Folding@home
supplement tests on existing drugs by expanding the search. </p>



<p>Even if
someone does identify a drug that can cripple SARS-CoV-2, “we don’t want to
stop there,” Bowman says. “The assumption is that, like many viruses, this is
going to mutate pretty fast, and that if we don’t keep up with it, we’ll be
right back with the same problem we have now. Tackling this thing on many
fronts is our best bet for success.”</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<h4>Why do you need a supercomputer for the simulations?</h4>



<p>“We have
to work on very, very, very small timescales” to capture the tiny jitters of
atoms in proteins, Bowman says. “Each step in the simulation is on the order of
a femtosecond,” or one quadrillionth of a second. To track protein motion over,
say, a second, “we’ve got to do like a billion-squared operations on the
computer, and each of those operations requires us to ask how every pair of
atoms in the protein and surrounding solution are interacting with each other,”
he says. By drawing on the computing power of many volunteers at once,
Folding@home performs calculations in a single month that could take an
ordinary desktop computer 100 years.</p>



<p>Folding@home
isn’t the only supercomputer put to the task of studying SARS-CoV-2. On March
23, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-announces-new-partnership-unleash-u-s-supercomputing-resources-fight-covid-19/">announced a new consortium</a> of companies, universities and
government agencies — including several national laboratories, NASA, IBM and
Microsoft — that are offering researchers access to their supercomputers to expedite
the discovery of treatments or a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<h4>Who can help with Folding@home?</h4>



<p>“Anyone can install our software on their personal computers and contribute” some of their unused computing power, Bowman says. “We’ve got everyone from people running it on their older laptops, to gamers that have really hardcore machines to … businesses who are pointing computer clusters at Folding@home.” </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Our relationship with our parents can have a big impact on our life trajectory. Research has found that those of us <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/">lied to by</a> caregivers often end up less well-adjusted, that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/11/is-your-work-ethic-rooted-in-the-quality-of-the-relationship-you-had-with-your-parents/">hard workers</a> are more likely to produce children with good work ethics, that cognitive skills can be improved by having <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/04/largest-observational-study-of-its-kind-finds-talkative-parents-have-kids-with-better-cognitive-skills-but-its-not-clear-why/">talkative parents</a>, and that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/15/positive-parenting-gets-under-the-skin-showing-up-years-later-in-the-cortisol-response/">positive parenting</a> can impact cortisol levels even years later.</p>
<p>But though we might pay less attention to it, how parents relate to one another is also important for children’s long-term development. A new study, published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w"><em>Demography</em></a><em>, </em>has taken a look at affection within parental relationships, finding that loving spousal relationships can have a positive long-term impact on children’s life paths.</p>
<p><span id="more-39379"></span>The researchers focused on Nepal, which they say provides an interesting backdrop for an investigation into marriage. Marriage has changed significantly in the country over the last few years: marrying for love (as opposed to arranged marriage) is now more common than it used to be, and rates of divorce and premarital cohabitation are also increasing in the country, though remain rare.</p>
<p>Data was gathered from a longitudinal study, where marital relationship quality and the educational and personal progress of children were tracked for twelve years. The first set of data was collected from 151 neighborhoods in the Western Chitwan Valley in 1996. The quality of relationships among married participants was measured by asking partners separately how much they loved their husband or wife on a three-point scale, and participants were also asked whether their spouse had ever beaten them.</p>
<p>To look at how parents’ relationships influenced children’s own marriage behaviour, the researchers then tracked the age at which children married over the next 10 years. In 2008, they also re-interviewed participants, asking mothers whether or not their children had dropped out of school, and if so at what age.</p>
<p>The results suggested that marriage quality was in fact associated with children’s educational prospects. Children with parents who reported greater love for each other were less likely to drop out of school, whilst those whose parents reported less love were more likely to stop education. Children with parents who reported spousal violence were also more likely to drop out.</p>
<p>Educational outcomes were also related to both class and ethnicity: children from ethnic groups with higher social status, from wealthier households, or whose parents had higher educational backgrounds were more likely to remain in education. The relationship between marriage quality and children’s life outcomes was still significant after controlling for these factors.</p>
<p>Children’s own marriage timing was also linked to levels of their parents’ spousal love: the more positive the parental relationship, the later children got married. It’s important to note that in the context of the study, this was considered to be a good thing — in Nepal, later marriage can imply a better match, and that children feel less need to leave the family home at any cost.</p>
<p>So, as expected, the quality of parents’ marriages had a significant impact on their children, both in terms of educational attainment and on their own relationships later in life. However, the findings may not bear out in the rest of the world, where other cultural factors may come into play. There may also have been nuances that were missed in the measures. For instance, participants were asked only about instances of <em>extreme</em> conflict between spouses; conflicts or abuse may have occurred that were more subtle or less extreme than domestic violence, but that had an impact on children nonetheless. Similarly, educational attainment was measured only by when children dropped out of school, failing to take into consideration what students did after leaving school or the grades they achieved.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, the results do pose an interesting question about how spousal relationships impact children. It’s understandable that parents spend much of their time focusing on their interactions with their children — but looking at the way they feel about their partner may be just as useful.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">When will the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing end?</a></h4>

<p>As the gears of the modern world
grind to a near halt, one question is likely on the mind of many: When will the
coronavirus pandemic — and social distancing — end? </p>



<p>No one knows for sure, but it’s probably not
any time soon. Here’s what we do know about when it may be safe to come out of
our homes and resume normal life. </p>



<h4>It will almost certainly take herd immunity to end the pandemic.</h4>



<p>Most experts say we’re past the
point of containing the virus, like we did with SARS and MERS. That means that
COVID-19 is here to stay, and the pandemic will end only with herd immunity.</p>





<p>Herd immunity describes what
proportion of a population has to be immune to a disease for the population as
a whole to be protected from outbreaks. The exact threshold depends on the
infectiousness of the disease, represented by the basic reproduction number, called
R<sub>0 </sub>(pronounced “R naught”).</p>



<p>When a new virus emerges, no one is
immune. A highly transmissible virus, like the coronavirus behind the current
pandemic, can spread like wildfire, quickly burning through the dry kindling of
a totally naive population. But once enough people are immune, the virus runs
into walls of immunity, and the pandemic peters out instead of raging ahead.
Scientists call that the herd immunity threshold. </p>



<h4>Up to two-thirds of a population would need to be infected to reach that threshold.</h4>



<p>Current estimates put the coronavirus’s R<sub>0</sub> between two or
three, meaning anyone with COVID-19 tends, on average, to infect two or three
other people. While this number can change based on our behavior, researchers
estimate that the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 is about one-third to two-thirds
of any given population. Worldwide, that means anywhere from 2.5 billion to 5
billion people.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t yet sure how long
people infected with COVID-19 remain immune, but so far it seems that they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread#reinfection">aren’t readily reinfected</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>





<h4>Letting the virus burn through the population would be the fastest approach.</h4>



<p>People acquire immunity against a virus
in two ways: Either they have been infected and recovered — gaining some level
of antibody protection — or they get a vaccine against the virus.</p>



<p>Since a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">vaccine is at least 12 to 18 months from being available</a> (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>), the fastest way to herd immunity would be to let the virus burn through the world’s population unimpeded. According to a March 16 report released by researchers at Imperial College London, in the United States, the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">pandemic would peak in about three months</a> under that scenario.</p>



<h4>But….</h4>



<p>The costs of such a strategy would
be overwhelming. Upward
of 2 million Americans would die from infection alone,
according to the same report. Roughly 81 percent of the U.S. population would
get infected, the team estimates.</p>



<p>The elderly and those with
underlying health conditions would be hardest hit, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-young-adults-can-face-severe-cases">younger people, too, can
experience severe illness</a> (<em>SN:
3/19/20</em>). And the critical care capacity of U.S. hospitals would be
exceeded as early as the second week of April, and eventually require 30 times
as many critical care beds as currently exist, the team estimates. While there
is much still unknown about the virus, most experts agree with this overall
picture.</p>



<p>The costs of delaying action any
further to slow the virus’ spread could be catastrophic, the researchers
conclude. That’s why countries around the world are trying various strategies
to quell the surge in cases, in effect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans">flattening the
exponential curve of the pandemic</a> and lessening the strain on hospitals. Those
measures primarily consist of aggressive social distancing, such as closing schools, cancelling large public events
and encouraging people to work from home if possible (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<h4>Social distancing reduces deaths but delays herd immunity. </h4>



<p>The necessary flipside of successful social
distancing is that achieving herd immunity gets delayed as cases decrease, says Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard
University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Even if collectively we
prevent a surge in the coming weeks, he says, the virus could reemerge as soon
restrictions are lifted.</p>



<p>“In the absence of robust herd immunity at the population level, we have
some risk of a second wave of the epidemic,” Mina says. </p>



<h4>Social distancing will need to last 1 to 3 months at minimum, potentially longer.</h4>



<p>Society could keep a lid on such a resurgence
by maintaining broad social distancing. The Trump administration on March 16 called for significant social
distancing for at least the following 15 days. But most experts expect such
measures will need to be in place in the United States for one to three months,
at minimum, to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.</p>



<p>We could get a big
break if the virus’ spread slows with warmer weather, though so far there’s no
indication that will happen. “That would be a great stroke of luck,” says
Maciej Boni, an epidemiologist at Penn State University, and may allow more
people to return to work once the number of new cases begins to fall. </p>

<p>Keeping schools closed and encouraging people to generally stay home could suppress the pandemic after five months, according to the Imperial College London report. But once such restrictions are lifted the virus would, in all probability, come roaring back. Until a vaccine becomes available, potentially in 12 to 18 months, the report argues that major, society-wide social distancing measures are necessary. </p>



<p>But such drastic changes to daily
life may be difficult to sustain, Boni says. “It’s like you’re holding back a
wave of infections with Saran Wrap.” </p>



<h4>More widespread diagnostic testing could ease the need for extensive social distancing.</h4>



<p>Whether such strict isolation could
be maintained for months on end is unknown. “We’ve never faced anything like
this before,” says Caitlin Rivers, an
epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The economic
costs would be enormous, especially for the most vulnerable members of society.
</p>



<p>“But I’m not ready to give up on the lessons
from places like South Korea and Taiwan,” Rivers says. “They’ve shown the virus
can be [locally] contained through general social distancing coupled with
extensive testing, case isolation and contact tracing.” South Korea, for
instance,  reported its <a href="https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&amp;bid=0030">highest number of new
cases, 909</a>
on February 29. Since then, the number has steadily decreased. On March 24, <a href="https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&amp;bid=0030">only 76 new cases were
reported</a>.</p>





<p>While the United States is ramping up testing,
it currently <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states">cannot test as widely
as many other countries</a> (<em>SN: 3/6/20</em>), allowing
the virus to spread undetected widely across the country. Until that capacity increases
significantly, the only tool the United States has to slow the virus’ spread is
blunt, widespread social distancing.</p>



<p>As staying home hopefully dampens the epidemic,
Boni, Rivers and Mina all say it’s key to use the coming months to rapidly expand testing infrastructure, while also
bolstering health care systems. </p>



<p>Testing allows public health
officials to identify new cases and isolate them, while tracing and testing
their contacts as quickly as possible. Testing and isolating potential contacts
before they develop symptoms is crucial, since the pandemic seems to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-infected-people-mild-cases-symptoms-stealth-spread-china">driven by
people who don’t know they’re sick</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/20</em>).</p>



<p>It would be “as though we’re back
at the beginning of the outbreak and taking targeted approaches,” Mina
says. With some luck, such an approach could keep outbreaks from spreading
until a vaccine creates herd immunity.</p>



<p>The feasibility of such a program
depends on many unknown variables. Firstly, it would require vastly more testing
than is currently available. It also requires rigorous and rapid contact
tracing after a positive case, which is no small task. Some countries have used
cell phone tracking data to aid this process.</p>



<h4>A big unknown: Are all these efforts sustainable?</h4>



<p>At this point, there are still too
many unknowns to know how — and when — we will reach herd immunity. In the
coming weeks, epidemiologists will be closely tracking the number of new U.S. cases
as well as the total number of tests to get a sense of whether social
distancing is working in a particular region. </p>



<p>“It’s been amazing to see the swing in society over the past week,” Mina says. “Nearly everyone has gotten on board.” But he worries about the sustainability of such strict measures as the weeks wear on. “Societal forces may end up overwhelming the science.”</p>

<p>However you can fit some
steps in your day, keep it up —
and the more, the better. </p>



<p>A new study of nearly 5,000
people finds an association between the total number of steps per day and the risk
of dying for any reason. Among the 655 participants who took fewer than 4,000
steps per day, the mortality rate was 76.7 per 1,000 people per year. (In distance,
4,000 steps is roughly 3 kilometers.) But among the 1,727 people who managed 4,000–7,999 steps per day, the death rate plummeted to 21.4
per 1,000 people. </p>



<p>It got even better for the
next group: Among the 1,539 people taking 8,000 to just under 12,000 daily steps,
the annual <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.1382?guestAccessKey=9f6744af-eb6c-4e03-9bca-d85492e1acab&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=032420">death rate was 6.9 per 1,000 people</a>, researchers report online March 24 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Study participants, who were
at least 40 years old, wore accelerometers that tracked their steps for up to a
week. Researchers collected the data from 2003 to 2006 as part of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and then followed the participants an
average of 10 years, during which time 1,165 of them died.</p>



<p>While there was a link
between the number of steps per day and the risk of dying, the researchers did
not find that the intensity of the steps — the number of steps per minute — was
associated with mortality risk in the study. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-bacteria-live-your-tongue-cells-map">Here’s where bacteria live on your tongue cells</a></h4>

<p>Myriad microbes dwell on
human tongues — and scientists have now
gotten a glimpse at the neighborhoods that bacteria build for themselves. </p>



<p>Bacteria grow in thick films,
with different types of microbes clustered in patches around individual cells
on the tongue’s surface, researchers report online March 24 in <em>Cell Reports</em>. This pattern suggests
individual bacterial cells first attach to the tongue cell’s surface and then grow
in layers as they form larger clusters — creating miniature environments the different
species need to thrive.  </p>



<p>“It’s amazing, the complexity of
the community that they build right there on your tongue,” says Jessica Mark Welch, a microbiologist at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. </p>



<p>Methods to identify microbial
communities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-flourish-favorite-ecosystems-human-body">typically hunt for genetic fingerprints</a> from various types of bacteria (<em>SN: 11/05/09</em>). The techniques can reveal
what lives on the tongue, but not how the bacterial community is organized in
space, Mark Welch says. </p>





<p>So she and her
colleagues had people scrape the top of their tongues with plastic scrapers.
Then the team tagged various types of bacteria in the tongue gunk with differently
colored fluorescent markers to see how the microbial community was
structured. </p>



<p>Bacterial cells, largely
grouped by type in a thick, densely packed biofilm, covered each tongue
surface cell. While the overall patchwork
appearance of the microbial community was consistent among cells from different
samples and people, the specific composition of bacteria varied, Mark Welch
says. </p>



<p>But some bacteria were
common across nearly all samples and tended to occupy roughly the same regions
around tongue cells. <em>Actinomyces </em>bacteria,
for example, were typically at the core of the structure, close to the human
cell. <em>Rothia</em>, on the other hand,tended to exist in large patches toward
the outside of the biofilm and <em>Streptococcus</em>
formed a thin outer layer. Two of these groups —<em>
Actinomyces </em>and <em>Rothia</em> — may be
important for converting dietary nitrate, a compound abundant in leafy green
vegetables, to nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and can help regulate
blood pressure. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-axions-how-matter-conquered-universe">Particles called axions could reveal how matter conquered the universe</a></h4>

<p>Chalk up a potential third win for
hypothetical particles called axions.</p>



<p>If the subatomic particles exist, they
could solve two pressing puzzles of particle physics: the source of the dark
matter that fills galaxies with invisible mass, and the reason why interactions
between quarks — the particles that make up protons and neutrons — adhere to a
certain symmetry of nature, called CP symmetry, that other types of particle interactions
eschew.</p>



<p>Now, two researchers say that axions could
solve a third thorny problem: why the universe is made mostly of matter, while
antimatter is rare. In the early universe, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.111602">the axion could have behaved in a manner that produces
an excess of matter</a>, particle physicists
Raymond Co and Keisuke Harigaya suggest in the March 20 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“They have an idea which has all the
right ingredients to do some interesting things,” says physicist Michael Dine
of the University of California, Santa Cruz. But it remains to be seen whether
the idea can fully reproduce the properties of the cosmos, he says. “This is
one of those cases where the devil is in the details.”</p>





<p>Scientists think that 13.8 billion years
ago, the Big Bang birthed equal parts matter and antimatter. Since matter and
antimatter particles annihilate when they meet, that would have left a universe
filled with pure energy. So, as the universe evolved, some process must have
favored matter over antimatter, but scientists still don’t know for sure how it
happened. Some researchers think, for example, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mounting-evidence-suggests-neutrinos-are-key-why-antimatter-is-rare">neutrinos played a role</a> (<em>SN: 11/25/19</em>).</p>



<p>Now Co, of the University of Michigan in
Ann Arbor, and Harigaya, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., propose a new idea for how matter gained the upper hand. It’s based on the
evolution of the axion field, a hypothetical ethereal blanket that permeates
space, similar to how an electric field extends around an electric charge. </p>



<p>Oscillations in the strength of the
axion field correspond to axion particles. Picture a marble in the bottom of a
plastic soda bottle: Jiggle the bottle, and the marble will wiggle back and
forth within one of the divots at the bottle’s base. Similar wiggles in an
axion field beget axions. In the early universe, the axion field would have had
a lot of energy, before settling into the lowest energy state possible — akin
to a marble high up the wall of the soda bottle sliding down into the divot. </p>



<p>What Co and Harigaya propose is that, instead
of rolling straight down the bottle’s side, the axion field would have instead
spiraled around the bottle to the bottom. Through a sequence of interactions
involving the strong force, which binds quarks together, and the weak force,
which produces certain radioactive decays, this spiraling, Co says, “is going
to lead to a production of more matter than antimatter in the early universe.”  </p>



<p>Scientists are currently searching for
axions, for example with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-have-narrowed-the-mass-range-for-hypothetical-dark-matter-axions">Axion Dark Matter Experiment</a> in Seattle (<em>SN:</em><em>3/6/20</em>). Co
and Harigaya’s theory predicts, however, that axions would be a bit more
massive than what ADMX is searching for. Future experiments, such as the <a href="http://iaxo.web.cern.ch/content/home-international-axion-observatory">International Axion Observatory</a>, could look for those bulkier particles.</p>



<p>However, the numbers don’t quite work out yet: The study predicts about 100 times as much dark matter as is needed to explain observations of the universe. But some additional considerations might be able to rectify that mismatch, Co and Harigaya say, for example, if another massive particle exists that scientists have yet to discover.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, they can develop physical synchronies. Both might tap their feet, sway their bodies, or clap their hands. “Through music, the producer and the perceiver connect emotionally and behaviourally,” note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a>, published in <em>NeuroImage</em>. And now this team, led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University, has uncovered a connection right down at the neural level. The team has observed “inter-brain coherence” (IBC) — a synchronisation in brain activity — between a musician and the audience. What’s more, the strength of this coherence could be used to predict how much the audience enjoyed a piece.</p>
<p><span id="more-39376"></span>The team used a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor the brain activity of a professional violinist while he was videoed playing a series of 12 brief, classical pieces. They then used the same technique (which involves shining beams of light through the skull, to monitor changes in blood flow) on 16 women while they watched the video, and listened to all of these pieces. (Because gender differences in inter-brain synchronisation have previously been observed, only women were recruited as listeners.)</p>
<p>The violinist had been instructed to look directly at the camera and maintain a neutral expression while he played the pieces, which each lasted about 100 seconds. If he was enjoying one piece more than another, the team hoped this would not be obvious to the viewers. They were told to gaze at the violinist’s face while they listened. After each piece, they rated how much they liked it on a seven-point scale.</p>
<p>The data revealed inter-brain coherence between each of the listeners and the musician, for all of the violin pieces. That is, there were similar patterns of heightened activity in certain key regions of the brain while the violinist played and the other participants listened.</p>
<p>The key regions included the left temporal cortex (which is thought to focus on processing the rhythm of sound information), the right inferior frontal cortex and the postcentral cortices. These two latter regions have been highlighted as important hubs of a hypothesised mirror system that allows a sender and receiver to share brain representations. “In the present study, the frontoparietal mirror neuron system allows audiences to experience or comprehend the mind of the performer as if they were to ‘walk in another’s shoes’,” the researchers believe.</p>
<p>The team also produced an average IBC score for each piece of music, and compared these with the listeners’ averaged liking scores for each piece. They found clear correlations. The more popular pieces were marked by stronger inter-brain coherence in the left temporal cortex between the audience as a whole and the performer.</p>
<p>The team also reported that the link between level of coherence and popularity only developed during the second half of each piece. This could be because there are two stages to music appreciation, they suggest. The first stage involves recognising rhythms, and identifying the potential musical structure of a piece. During the next stage, the listener develops aesthetic judgements and experiences emotional resonance, and generates stronger predictions about the sounds that ‘should’ follow. “If the expectation matches the incoming information, the musical performance will be experienced as pleasant,” the team thinks.</p>
<p>More work will be needed to explain why the coherence-liking effect only emerged at a group level, and to explore whether the results obtained here will also apply to other types of musical instrument, and other genres. The team also note that the near-infrared technique only allowed them to look at blood flow in the cortex, not other deeper areas that might be involved in the response to music production and perception, too, such as limbic structures. Also, by design, this study only involved women. Whether men will respond in the same way is unknown.</p>
<p>Still, it’s fascinating research. “This study expands our understanding of music appreciation,” the researchers write, adding: “The results can potentially be applied to the development of brain indices for predicting public attitudes towards various musical performances.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620217952/0/oupblogpsychology/">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></h4>

<p>The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">COVID-19 pandemic</a> was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.</p><p>The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.</p><p>Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.</p><p>COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to <em>be</em> its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.</p><p>COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.</p><p>Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.</p><p>For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.</p><p>Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tooth-enamel-protein-found-eyes-common-form-macular-degeneration">A tooth-enamel protein is found in eyes with a common form of macular degeneration</a></h4>

<p>Deposits
of a mineral found in tooth enamel at the back of the eye could be hastening
the progression of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of
deteriorating eyesight in people over 50. </p>



<p>Now researchers have identified a protein called amelotin that experiments suggest is involved in producing the mineral deposits that are the hallmark of “dry” age-related macular degeneration, the most common of the two forms of the disease. Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, affects about 3 million people in the United States. But the new finding, if confirmed, could change that.</p>



<p>While the “wet” form of AMD, which comprises up to 30 percent of AMD cases, can be treated with injections, there are currently no treatments for dry AMD.</p>



<p>“Finding amelotin in these deposits makes it a target to try to slow the progression of mineralization, which, if it’s borne out, could result in new therapies,” says Imre Lengyel, an ophthalmologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland who was not involved in the research.  </p>





<p>These deposits, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1413347112">first documented in 2015</a>, are made of a type of mineralized calcium called hydroxyapatite and appear beneath the retinal pigment epithelium — a layer of cells just outside the retina that keeps its light-sensing rods and cones happy and healthy. The deposits may worsen vision by blocking the flow of oxygen and nutrients needed to nourish those light-sensitive cells of the retina. By contrast, in wet AMD abnormal blood vessels intrude into the retina and often leak. Both types of AMD distort a person’s central vision — the focused, detailed sight needed for reading and recognizing faces — which can make independent living difficult. </p>



<p>For the new study, published online February 26 in <em>Translational Research</em>, researchers grew retinal pigment epithelial cells in the lab, and then subjected them to a form of stress that may be common in aging eyes: a loss of nutrients.</p>



<p>“One of
the problems with this disease and with aging is that blood vessels aren’t
delivering the blood they used to, and that loss of nutrients and oxygen could
be driving the course of the disease,” says Graeme Wistow, an ophthalmologist at
the National Eye Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>After
Wistow and his colleagues deprived the cells of nutrients for nine days, a gene
involved in producing amelotin called <em>AMTN</em> switched on and started
making the protein, which in turn caused hydroxyapatite deposits to form. Blocking
the gene’s activity <a href="https://www.translationalres.com/article/S1931-5244(20)30036-0/fulltext">prevented the
deposits from forming</a> in lab experiments, the scientists report. The team also
found amelotin in cadaver eyes that suffered from dry AMD, concentrated in
areas with large deposits of hydroxyapatite. </p>



<p>“It’s a
ways off, but the best possible outcome would be finding a way to inhibit
amelotin or its gene expression in a way that prevented or delayed the
deposition of hydroxyapatite,” Wistow says. That “might allow people to keep
their vision a bit longer.” </p>



<p>But Lengyel
and other researchers want to see the results verified in mice or lab-grown
cells that more closely resemble a living human eye. Wistow and his
colleagues are currently working on breeding mice with eyes that more closely
mimic those of humans suffering from dry AMD to test their findings. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size">Astronomers have found the edge of the Milky Way at last</a></h4>

<p>Our galaxy is a whole lot bigger than it looks. New work finds that the Milky Way stretches nearly 2 million light-years across, more than 15 times wider than its luminous spiral disk. The number could lead to a better estimate of how massive the galaxy is and how many other galaxies orbit it.</p>



<p>Astronomers have long known that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-d-map-stars-reveals-milky-way-warped-shape">the brightest part of the Milky Way</a>, the pancake-shaped disk of stars that houses the sun, is some 120,000 light-years across (<em>SN: 8/1/19</em>). Beyond this stellar disk is a disk of gas. A vast halo of dark matter, presumably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">full of invisible particles</a>, engulfs both disks and stretches far beyond them (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>). But because the dark halo emits no light, its diameter is hard to measure.</p>



<p>Now, Alis Deason, an astrophysicist at Durham University in England, and her colleagues have used nearby galaxies to locate the Milky Way’s edge. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09497">precise diameter is 1.9 million light-years</a>, give or take 0.4 million light-years, the team reports February 21 in a paper posted at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>To put that size into perspective, imagine a map in which the distance between the sun and the Earth is just one inch. If the Milky Way’s heart were at the center of the Earth, the galaxy’s edge would be four times farther away than the moon actually is.</p>





<p>To find the Milky Way’s edge, Deason’s team conducted computer simulations of how giant galaxies like the Milky Way form. In particular, the scientists sought cases where two giant galaxies arose side by side, like the Milky Way and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-reaches-out-touch-milky-way">Andromeda</a>, our nearest giant neighbor, because each galaxy’s gravity tugs on the other (<em>SN: 5/12/15</em>). The simulations showed that just beyond the edge of a giant galaxy’s dark halo, the velocities of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-nine-new-dwarf-galaxies-found-outside-milky-way">small nearby galaxies</a> drop sharply (<em>SN: 3/11/15</em>).</p>



<p>Using existing telescope observations, Deason and her colleagues found a similar plunge in the speeds of small galaxies near the Milky Way. This occurred at a distance of about 950,000 light-years from the Milky Way’s center, marking the galaxy’s edge, the scientists say. The edge is 35 times farther from the galactic center than the sun is.</p>



<p>Although dark matter makes up most of the Milky Way’s mass, the simulations reveal that stars should also exist at these far-out distances. “Both have a well-defined edge,” Deason says. “The edge of the stars is very sharp, almost like the stars just stop at a particular radius.”</p>



<p>In the future, astronomers can refine the location of the Milky Way’s edge by discovering additional small galaxies nearby. Astronomers could also search for individual stars out at the boundary, says Mike Boylan-Kolchin, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved with the study. The farthest such stars will be very dim, but future observations should be able to find them.</p>



<p>The measurement should also help astronomers tease out other galactic properties. For instance, the larger the Milky Way, the more massive it is — and the more galaxies there should be revolving around it, says Rosemary Wyse, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University who was not part of the new work. So far, there are about 60 known Milky Way satellites, but astronomers suspect that many more await discovery.</p>

<h4>Coronavirus questions</h4>



<p><em>Lessons from outbreaks of coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS may help scientists get a handle on the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus, <strong>Tina Hesman Saey</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers">How the new coronavirus stacks up against SARS and MERS</a>” (</em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader<strong>
Inge Revuelta </strong>wondered about scientists’ calculations of how infectious the
new coronavirus is — its R<sub>0</sub>. “I would like to know if this estimated
number has any real practicality considering that the community of experts in
this field has failed to reach a consensus on its accuracy,” <strong>Revuelta</strong>
wrote. </p>





<p>The R<sub>0</sub>
can vary over time as people in a population become immune to the virus, or as
public health measures are put in place, <strong>Saey</strong> says. “The number has
practical implications. It helps public health officials anticipate how big an
outbreak might be and plan responses. It also indicates whether public health
measures are working,” she says. Travel restrictions in Wuhan, China, seemed to
reduce the virus’ spread, decreasing the R<sub>0</sub>, according to a study
posted online February 18 at medRxiv.org. </p>



<p>Reader <strong>Diana
Lutz </strong>wondered if the new coronavirus could become seasonal like the flu. “Are
MERS and SARS seasonal?” she asked.</p>



<p>Like influenza and common cold viruses, the new virus could stick around infecting people if control efforts fail, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread">it is unknown if the virus will become seasonal</a> (<em>SN Online: 3/4/20</em>). Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is not seasonal and has not caused an epidemic since the initial outbreak in 2002. Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, does not seem to reliably be seasonal, at least not the way influenza is, <strong>Saey</strong> says. “Camels may carry the MERS virus year-round, but some researchers have detected a peak in infections about six months after the winter calving season,” she says. “That’s typically when young camels catch MERS and may be more likely to pass it to people later on.” More MERS cases in people occur April through July, studies have shown, but people may catch the virus at other times of year. </p>





<h4>Feline fascination</h4>



<p><em>New research may reduce house cats’ allergen levels or make people less reactive to their feline friends,<strong> Erika Engelhaupt </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-work-tame-cat-allergies-crispr-vaccine-food-therapy">With a litter of tactics, scientists work to tame cat allergies</a>” (</em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Mark
Friedman </strong>wondered if there was an at-home test available to measure a cat’s
allergen levels. “How hard could it be to create a chemical card test that
could be touched with cat saliva?” <strong>Friedman</strong> asked. </p>



<p>Such a
home test kit doesn’t appear to exist, <strong>Engelhaupt</strong> says. When she wanted
to get her cat’s allergen levels tested, the only option she could find was to
send hair samples to Indoor B­iotechnologies, a company that does consumer
testing for a fee. </p>



<p><strong>Martin
Chapman</strong>, founder of Indoor Biotechnologies,
says that the c­ompany about 15 years ago experimented with a rapid test for the
feline protein that triggers allergies in people. But the test, which analyzed
dust and could analyze hair and saliva samples, showed n­egative results at
high allergen concentrations. “Not good,” <strong>Chapman </strong>says. </p>



<p>A
saliva-based test is an interesting idea and could have a market, <strong>E­ngelhaupt</strong>
says, especially as new allergen treatments come out; cat owners may want to
monitor their cats’ levels. </p>



<h4>Speeding space rock  </h4>



<p><em>Asteroid 2020 AV2 is the first found orbiting closer to the sun than Venus, <strong>C­hristopher Crockett</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">For the first time, an asteroid has been found nearer to the sun than Venus</a>” (</em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 5<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>A­ntonia
Musgrave</strong> asked how fast 2020 AV2 travels.</p>



<p>The
asteroid has a range of speeds, from roughly 126,000 k­ilometers per hour to
170,000 km/h, <strong>C­rockett</strong> says. That’s because its orbit — from just
inside Venus’ orbit to Mercury’s orbit and back — is elliptical. “The asteroid
speeds up as it gets closer to Mercury’s orbit, and then slows down as it goes

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-coronavirus-is-both-work-and-worry">When coronavirus is both work and worry</a></h4>

<p>When the news first surfaced in December of a flulike
outbreak in China, a lot of us here at <em>Science News</em> felt our spidey
senses tingle. China has sparked earlier outbreaks of diseases that travel from
animals to people, notably SARS, which emerged from a live-animal market in
2002 and killed 774 people worldwide. I covered that outbreak, and it was
scary. The virus spread easily, had about a 10 percent fatality rate and
overwhelmed hospitals trying to quell it. SARS, short for severe acute
respiratory syndrome, was ultimately stopped by rigorous infection control and
quarantines — classic public health responses.</p>



<p>So far this new coronavirus appears to have a lower case
fatality rate than SARS but is harder to intercept, because in most cases the
symptoms are milder, raising the odds that people infected with the virus,
called SARS-CoV-2, can spread disease without even realizing that they are ill.
That may be the case with an Episcopalian reverend in Washington, D.C., who was
diagnosed after presiding over services attended by more than 500 people. </p>



<p>The <em>Science News</em> office is less than two miles from
that minister’s church. News of this coronavirus case, the first in Washington,
D.C., was announced on March 8. I had dinner at a restaurant a few blocks away
from the church on March 6 and got my hair cut nearby on March 7. This brings
the epidemic close to home in a personal way.</p>



<p>Of course, we are all worried about the health of our families, friends and colleagues, and how we can keep them safe amid the uncertainty. At the same time, the <em>Science News </em>team is deeply invested in providing rigorously accurate news and context on the outbreak, such as Tina Hesman Saey’s deep dive into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs">efforts to repurpose existing drugs to combat the new virus</a>. We need to figure out how to stay healthy while also covering the pandemic, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says could continue into next year. </p>



<p>Before the new coronavirus, we had started working on
systems that would make it possible for us to do our jobs outside of our Dupont
Circle townhouse. Back then, the complications we were preparing for were the
basics, a snowstorm or a busted HVAC system. Now we’re hustling to deploy an
electronic production system so that we can work remotely if the schools close,
or if we’re quarantined at home, or if, God forbid, one of us gets sick. Some
old-school publishing practices, like hand-correcting proofs on paper, are
going by the wayside. And our weekly Thursday teatime, an enjoyable chance to
step away from our screens and visit with colleagues, may become “virtual tea” so
that we can still enjoy the pleasure of each other’s company — from a safe
distance. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></h4>

<p>Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet">scientific scrutiny</a> – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets">the best diet of 2020</a> for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.</p><p>If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.</p><p>Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?</p><p>Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.</p><p>The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.</p><p>Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.</p><p>One recent <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281">study</a> of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.</p><p>So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-work-conditions-shape-healthcare/" rel="nofollow">How work conditions shape healthcare</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/" rel="nofollow">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable">Why some heart patients may be especially vulnerable to COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>As researchers examine
deaths from COVID-19, heart patients appear especially vulnerable.</p>



<p>In Italy, where the number
of deaths has now surpassed those in China, public health officials reported on
March 17 that among 355 people who died, a whopping 76 percent had hypertension
and 33 percent had heart disease. And among more than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-coronavirus-spread-reach-u-s-communities-cdc">44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19</a> in China (<em>SN:
2/25/20</em>), the case fatality rate for people with underlying conditions was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130?guestAccessKey=bdcca6fa-a48c-4028-8406-7f3d04a3e932&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=022420">highest for those with cardiovascular disease</a>, at 10.5 percent compared with the overall fatality
rate of 2.3 percent.  </p>



<p>Researchers know generally that infections can take a toll on people who have other health problems. But SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may pose particular danger to the heart because of how the virus gets into cells, researchers speculate.</p>



<p>To invade a cell, SARS-CoV-2
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells">latches onto a protein</a> called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 (<em>SN: 3/3/20</em>). This protein is found on
cells in the lungs, allowing the virus to invade these cells and
cause respiratory symptoms. But ACE2 also
is on heart muscle cells and cells that line the blood vessels. </p>







<p>Considering the involvement
of ACE2, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5">COVID-19 may damage the heart directly</a>, researchers write in a commentary in <em>Nature Reviews Cardiology</em> March 5. According
to studies out of Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started, some people with
COVID-19 have developed myocardial injury, the death of heart cells for reasons other than a heart attack.</p>



<p>Nearly 20 percent of 416 patients hospitalized in Wuhan with the illness <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950?guestAccessKey=f0e95b50-fbb4-4d35-9306-e55e01f820bd&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=032520">showed signs of heart damage</a>, another research team reports March 25 in <em>JAMA Cardiology</em>. This complication increased the mortality risk for the patients: Half of those with heart damage died compared with only 4.5 percent of the other hospitalized COVID-19 patients as of February 10, the study finds.</p>



<p>But ACE2 does more than
offer an entry point for SARS-CoV-2. The protein is also part of a wide-ranging
system of hormones, called the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, that
regulates blood pressure and cardiovascular and kidney function. Drugs that
target other parts of this system are widely prescribed to lower blood pressure
in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. </p>



<p>Two classes of these drugs —
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers — are getting some scrutiny
during the COVID-19 pandemic. ACE inhibitors block ACE proteins, which are
different than ACE2 proteins. The aim is to prevent ACE from helping to make a
protein called angiotensin II, which increases blood pressure in the arteries. Angiotensin
II receptor blockers, or ARBs, stop angiotensin II from functioning. </p>



<p>There is some evidence in
animals that use of these drugs can lead to more ACE2 protein on cells in the
heart. But there haven’t been studies showing this in people, or studies in the
context of COVID-19. Nor have there been reports describing the types of
medications that patients who’ve had severe COVID-19 or have died from the
infection were taking.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>But the animal evidence has
led some to wonder if the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs can increase the risk
of severe disease. “If you look at the mechanistic rationale for concern … it’s
there,” although at this point it’s “an extrapolation,” Anthony Fauci, director
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., said during a webcast interview with the
editor in chief of <em>JAMA</em> on March 18.
“We really need to get data, and we need to get data fast.”</p>



<p>Until there’s more research,
the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and the
Heart Failure Society of America are advising people with hypertension,
cardiovascular disease or heart failure to <a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/17/08/59/hfsa-acc-aha-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-raas-antagonists-in-covid-19">continue taking these medications</a>. For those who develop COVID-19, the condition of the
individual patient should be considered to determine whether it’s necessary to stop
the drugs, the groups recommended in a statement released March 17. </p>



<p>Besides the possibility that
SARS-CoV-2 targets the heart itself, researchers have evidence that the body’s
response to infections can put the heart in danger, especially for those with
underlying medical conditions. For example, having the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702090">flu can increase the risk of a heart attack</a>, a 2018 study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine </em>found. </p>





<p>Infections can place an
undue burden on a heart that’s already struggling with cardiovascular disease. “Respiratory
infections in general have the potential to increase the workload that the
heart is under,” says cardiologist Scott Solomon of Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “That means that your heart’s
going to need more oxygen.” As influenza and COVID-19 can interfere with the
lungs ability to deliver oxygen, “that can put an additional strain on the
heart,” he says.</p>



<p>An infection also stresses other
parts of the cardiovascular system, notably where arteries are narrowed by plaques.
As the body’s immune system fights the virus, “inflammation can cause a plaque
rupture,” says preventive cardiologist Erin Michos of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. That rupture induces blood clotting that can block an
artery and lead to a heart attack.</p>



<p>“The question is, why is the heart getting weak” during a COVID-19 infection, says Michos. For now, she recommends that her patients take seriously the recommendations to wash hands and to practice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans">social distancing</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). “I am telling them to stay home if they can,” she says. “I’m very concerned for everybody, but particularly for my cardiac patients.”</p>

<p><strong>An imaging technique adapted from geophysics could provide a new way of looking at the human brain, </strong><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/seismic-imaging-technology-sees-deep-inside-the-brain/">reports Ian Randall</a> at <em>Physics World</em>. Researchers have traditionally been unable to scan the brain using ultrasound, as the waves are scattered by the skull. But now a team have shown that ultrasound <em>can</em> be used to record signals from inside the skull, with the help of a method normally used to construct images from below the surface of the Earth based on seismometer recordings.</p>

<p>Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that <em>PLOS ONE</em> published its first COVID-19 paper since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548">The study</a> was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.</p>
<p>Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Since February 1<sup>st</sup>, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science <em>and </em>its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Adults are vulnerable to all kinds of body illusions. We can be made to feel that a<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-27/edition-3/interview-people-have-been-ignoring-body-long-time"> fake hand, or even a fake body, is our own; that we’ve left our body; even that we’re the size of a doll</a>. These illusions work because our brains use information from various senses to create mental representations of our bodies. Mess with some of these sensory signals, and you can alter those representations, sometimes drastically.</p>
<p>Work to date suggests that young children don’t show the same susceptibilities to body illusions, presumably because the systems that underpin them are still developing. Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0">new study</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, has found that a bizarre auditory-induced illusion that affects adults doesn’t work in quite the same way in young kids, either.</p>
<p><span id="more-39359"></span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/10/28/how-listening-to-an-ipod-shrinks-your-sense-of-personal-space/">Ana Tajadura-Jiménez</a>, now at Charles III University of in Madrid, has led all kinds of fascinating work showing that body illusions can be triggered through the manipulation of sound. Take her “<a href="http://magicshoes.es/the-team/">magic shoes</a>“, for example. Microphones record the sound of the wearer walking. But this sound is then filtered, so only the the higher-pitched portions are played on to them, through earphones. This has the effect of making the wearer sound lighter, which leads them to report <em>feeling</em> lighter and more sprightly.</p>
<p>For the new study, Elena Nava at the University of Milano-Bicocca and Tajadura-Jiménez turned to what’s known as the “auditory Pinocchio illusion”. In earlier work, Tajadura-Jiménez and colleagues had found that if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Why? Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space, and so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, this metaphor is influencing our perceptions. Like adults, even babies get the “high” vs “low” pitch metaphor — so perhaps young children would experience this illusion, too. But when the pair tried a version of it on a group of 30 four- to six-year-olds, and on a group of 30 adults, they found some differences between the responses of the two groups.</p>
<p>For this study, the participants didn’t pull on their own fingers. Rather, they pressed their palm up against a vertical wooden surface, and their hand was screened with a cloth, so they couldn’t see it. An experimenter then repeatedly either pulled or pressed on their middle finger while they heard a tone that ascended in pitch, descended in pitch or remained constant.</p>

<p>Each time, the participant used a scale on the side of the board to indicate where they felt the tip of their middle finger to be in space. They were also asked about whether they <em>perceived</em> their finger to be getting longer, shrinking, or staying the same length.</p>
<p>The team found that when ascending notes were played during finger-pulling, adults indicated that their middle finger tip was higher (and so the finger was longer) than it actually was.</p>
<p>Children, on the other hand, did not indicate that their finger tip was higher during these ascending notes — and yet like the adults, they reported <em>feeling</em> that their finger was getting longer.</p>
<p>This suggests that by around the age of four to six, a child’s thoughts and feelings about what’s happening to its body — its “body image” — is adult-like (at least, in this context). However, its unconscious body “schema” — the brain’s map of the body in space — is not yet being calibrated in the same way as an adult’s.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the researchers did not find that tones of descending pitch played while the finger was being pressed made adults or children think that their finger was getting smaller. “Why can the brain ‘accept’ a longer finger but not a shorter one?” the researchers ask. “This asymmetry could reflect the fact that the brain experiences, throughout development, the enlargement of most parts of the body, while it never experiences shrinkage,” they suggest.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, the pair then tried a version of the same experiment, but with the participants’ arms and hands positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. In this orientation, the longer finger effect that they had just found in adults was not repeated. As the high/low metaphor for pitch is vertical in nature, not horizontal, this “supports our hypothesis that crossmodal ‘metaphoric’ correspondences influence the binding of multisensory information,” the researchers write.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.</span></p>
<h3><b>PLOS Operations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. </span></p>
<h3><b>Reassurance for Our Research Communities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their </span><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">database </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of publications on coronavirus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a </span><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reviewers</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can, please review </span><a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprints related to coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid PreReview server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)</span></li>
</ul>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a></h4>

<p>How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.</p><p>People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.</p><p>Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262">In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone</a>. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.</p><p>The main group decision-making biases are <em>risky shift</em>, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and <em>groupthink</em>, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.</p><p>Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused<em> cognitive conflict</em> arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.</p><p>Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.</p><p>Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. <em>Devil’s advocacy</em> is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. <em>Dialectical inquiry</em> is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.</p><p>Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.</p><p>Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict<strong>. </strong>Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.</p><p>In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.</p><p>An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.</p><div><figure><img height="310" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg" width="620" />Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]</figure></div><p>Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.</p><p>Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=John+M.+Bryson">There is increasing evidence that</a> the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4">Unsplash </a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/why-an-irish-buddhist-resisted-empire-in-burma/" rel="nofollow">Why an Irish Buddhist resisted empire in Burma</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-title-ix-changed-american-ballet/" rel="nofollow">How Title IX changed American ballet</a></li></ul> </div>

Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintaining people’s safety at home</strong></h3>
<p>To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240">different factors</a>, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long">the prevention of such risks</a>.</p>

After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5">older people themselves also express their concerns</a> regarding these issues.</p>

Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X">collaborative skills</a> and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/">strengthen these linkages</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life</strong></h3>
<p>This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.</p>
<h3><strong>Expanding the health care paradigm</strong></h3>
<p>Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though some <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/">research</a> has challenged the common conception that scent is the most evocative of all the senses, it can be undeniably powerful when you catch a whiff of something that jogs a memory. We also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/">know</a> that scent plays a part in sexual attraction: people with a keener sense of smell often find sex more pleasant and may even have more orgasms during sex, and the scent of a partner can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293018">reduce stress</a> and increase feelings of safety.</p>
<p>So new research findings from a team at the University of British Columbia may not come as a complete surprise. In a paper <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;journalCode=pssa">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;journalCode=pssa">Psychological Science</a>, </em>Marlise Hofer and Frances Chen suggest that the scent of your lover may not just be comforting but can also help you drift off to sleep.<span id="more-39349"></span></p>
<p>The team asked 155 heterosexual participants in long-term romantic relationships to sleep with a t-shirt for a pillowcase on two separate nights. One of these shirts had previously been worn for 24 hours by their romantic partner, and the other was a control shirt, which had either not been worn, or worn by a “scent donor” unknown to participants. T-shirt wearers were asked to refrain from using any scented body products and to avoid activities likely to produce odours such as exercise, smoking, sex or eating pungent foods.</p>
<p>Each night, participants’ “sleep efficiency” — i.e. the proportion of time they spent in bed that they were actually asleep — was measured via a smartwatch  Then, in the morning, participants were asked what time they went to bed and got up, how they would rate their sleep quality, how well rested they felt, and whether or not they believed the scent was their partner’s or the control.</p>
<p>As expected, sleep efficiency was higher on nights spent sleeping with a partner’s shirt rather than with a control shirt — and this was still the case when controlling for multiple factors, including participants’ relationship quality and length, attachment style and levels of stress. Efficiency was increased by an average of 2.1% — around the same increase induced by melatonin supplements, often used to improve sleep. And though participants were able to identify their partner’s scent 70% of the time, the results also suggested that sleep efficiency improved whether or not participants were aware that the t-shirt was their partner’s.</p>
<p>When it came to sleep quality, however, participants only reported having higher quality sleep when they <em>believed</em> they were spending the night with their partner’s shirt, whether or not they were actually exposed to their smell.</p>
<p>Individual differences, the team notes, are likely to moderate these effects, something the study did not explore in depth. Women, for example, were more likely to see an increase in sleep efficiency than men, and factors like relationship quality are likely to have a variety of impacts on both quality and efficiency of sleep.</p>
<p>But for anyone who’s ever struggled to drift off when alone, the results are still cheering. Melatonin is all well and good — but a worn t-shirt could be the real secret to getting a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>It might be the best-studied of all our senses, but surprises about the way our vision works just keep on coming. Recent research has startling and also salutary lessons about how we see.<span id="more-39341"></span></p>
<h4><strong>Your brain makes up a lot of what you “see”</strong></h4>
<p>Whether you’re walking around or sitting at a desk, you no doubt feel that you can see pretty clearly all around you. Yes, so you might be looking ahead as you walk through a park, say, but you can see a rich world of grass, trees and people to either side of you. Well, you might be seeing it — but that doesn’t mean it’s all actually there. As <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616672270">research published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2016</a> revealed, your brain uses information from the clearly-focused central region of the visual field to fill in detail in the relatively data-poor periphery. In fact, as the lead author, Marte Otten at the University of Amsterdam, commented at the time, “Our findings show that, under the right circumstances, a large part of the periphery may be a visual illusion”. It’s what’s known as a “uniformity illusion”, and you can try it for yourself at <a href="http://www.uniformillusion.com">www.uniformillusion.com</a>.</p>
<p>However, not all peripheral vision is the same… <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3573">work published the following year</a> suggests that we all have “good” and “bad” regions. Some of the participants in this study, led by John Greenwood at UCL, had sharper left-side than right-side peripheral vision, for example.</p>
<p>And this could have real-world effects, says Greenwood — someone searching a room for missing keys, for example, could fail to spot those keys if they’re on their “bad” side.</p>
<h4><strong>It’s easy to make someone hallucinate (without drugs)</strong></h4>
<p>If you have a willing partner to hand, you can try one hallucination-inducing technique right now. All you have to do, according to research led by Giovanni Caputo and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">published in <em>Psychiatry Research</em></a>, is to sit in chairs placed opposite each other, about a metre apart, in a fairly dimly lit room, and look into each other’s eyes. When the 20 young adults in the study tried this for 10 minutes, they reported all kinds of odd experiences. Along with altered perceptions of sounds and time, 90 per cent saw some deformed facial features, while three-quarters said they saw a monster. A state of dissociation might explain these results, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>Another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/09/researchers-show-there-is-a-simple-way-to-induce-synesthesia-in-people-with-normal-perception/">published last year by Anupama Nair and David Brang</a>, found that it’s possible to induce synaesthesia-type visual sensations in regular people. For this work, participants sat with their eyes closed in a darkened room for five minutes. Then they were given a simple mental imagery task, designed purely to raise activity levels in the visual cortex. During this task, occasional, unpredictably-timed beeps were played. Overall, nearly 60 per cent reported at least one sound-induced visual perception, such as seeing colourful small circles, flashes or sparkles of light or visual pulses.</p>
<p>It’s known that the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00458-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214004588?showall=true">visual cortex processes auditory data, too</a>. Short-term visual deprivation can, it seems, make it more likely that sounds will actually trigger visual hallucinations.</p>
<h4><strong>Time stops when you blink</strong></h4>
<p>For about 10% of your waking hours, your eyes are actually shut, because of blinking. Your brain stitches together retinal information from around these gaps, giving you the impression that your vision is uninterrupted. However, these brief but regular dark moments do have an impact: a study led by Ayelet Landau suggests they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily. This work, published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2019 and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/14/your-brain-stops-time-when-you-blink/">covered by me on the Research Digest</a>, shows that processing in the visual cortex influences our perceptions of time. It’s possible that when we’re engaged in tasks that stimulate plenty of other senses (when we’re outside, say, rather than sitting at a desk, staring at a screen, reading about psychological research…), this effect could be counteracted.</p>
<h4><strong>You can see infrared and ultraviolet</strong></h4>
<p>A few animals, such as pit vipers and common vampire bats, are infamous for being able to sense the infrared body heat of their prey. This is not a human ability. In fact, we’re not meant to be able to detect infrared at all. However, as an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/E5445">initially serendipitous discovery by researchers at the University of Washington reveals</a>, there are very particular circumstances in which it becomes possible. While working with an infrared laser, which is meant to be invisible to the human eye, researchers at the university reported seeing occasional green flashes. Vladimir Kefalov and colleagues investigated. They found that if two long-wavelength infrared photons of light hit a light-sensitive molecule in a cone cell in the retina in rapid succession, they have the same energy impact as a shorter, visible photon — and this triggers a green perception.</p>
<p>If such infrared vision is very rare, there are <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/lastword/mg24432591-000-super-seers-why-some-people-can-see-ultraviolet-light/">anecdotal reports</a> that seeing very short, ultraviolet wavelengths of light — an ability normally associated with birds and butterflies, for instance — is much more achievable. The cornea and lens absorb this light, so, it’s true, we normally can’t see it. However, people who have had their lenses removed — often because of cataracts — have reported seeing (in blueish-purple) everything from patterns on flowers to ultraviolet light beams from counterfeit banknote detectors.</p>
<h4><strong>Childhood experience can create strange visual categories</strong></h4>
<p>It probably wouldn’t surprise you to learn that you have dedicated circuits of neurons in your visual cortex dedicated to processing particular categories of visual stimulus — such as one for faces, and another for words. But, it seems, these category regions are established through experience in childhood, and as long as your youthful experience with a given type of visual stimulus is intense enough, your visual cortex may well set up a dedicated response unit to handle it on into adulthood. The main recent evidence for this comes from a study by Jesse Gomez and his team, showing that adults who played Pokémon extensively as kids had a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/14/adults-who-played-pokemon-extensively-in-childhood-have-a-pokemon-sensitive-region-in-their-visual-cortex/">visual region that was more active when viewing Pokémon characters</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>When you’re afraid, you literally see things differently</strong></h4>
<p>According to a popular model of perception, what you see is generally a function of data coming from the retina to your brain and what your brain expects to see. Depending on the situation, sometimes the retinal data will be given more weight, but other times the brain will rely more on expectation in generating your visual perceptions. We all have a tendency to err on the side of caution — given the potential risk vs benefit, if you’re walking through snake-infested territory, say, it’s safer to see a long shape on the ground as a snake rather than a stick.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854">work published in <em>Nature Communications</em> in 2017</a> provided evidence that when our heart is beating rapidly — when we’re afraid (and perhaps also angry) — we’re especially likely to see threats when there are none.</p>
<p>In this study, racial biases also came into play. The team —Ruben Azevedo, Sarah Garfinkel, Hugo Critchley and Manos Tsakiris — showed images of either black or white individuals holding either a gun or a mobile phone. When the images were presented on the heartbeat, rather than between heartbeats, they were 10% more likely to see the object as a gun when it was held by a black person. The researchers think this effect might explain at least some shootings of black unarmed men by police officers.</p>
<p>Another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/14/what-does-fear-do-to-our-vision/">published a year earlier by Maria Lojowska’s team</a>, found that when we’re afraid, we perceive some aspects of the world more clearly, but at the cost of ignoring much of the detail.</p>
<h4><strong>How to mess with your colleagues’ minds</strong></h4>
<p>Many optical illusions are presented in 2D, on paper, or on a computer screen. But in 2018, a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/14/a-psychologist-noticed-this-cool-chair-illusion-in-his-office/">mind-bending 3D chair illusion</a> showed itself in the office of Nick Scott-Samuel at the University of Bristol. The set of stackable chairs seem to be arranged in an impossible position — a little like an Escher drawing, only stranger. This is because, Scott-Samuel and his colleagues report, the brain gets confused about apparent depth cues when <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2041669517752372/suppl_file/StackingChairsMovie.mp4">viewing the chairs at an angle</a>. Just four chairs are apparently enough to achieve the effect. So next time you’re early for a meeting, you know what to do…</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.</p>
<p>Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.</p>
<p>As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.</p>
<p>“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”</p>
<p>Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”</p>
<p>Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”</p>
<p>arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology/">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a></h4>

<p>The human brain is often described as the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18233409">most complex object in the known universe</a> – we know so much, and yet so little, about the way it works. It’s no wonder then that the study of brain today encompasses an enormous range of topics, from abstract understanding of consciousness to microscopic exploration of billions of neurons. Brain Awareness Week takes place this year March 16-22. To mark the occasion, we’ve put together a list of books that explore the matter between your ears.</p><ol><li><em> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/birth-of-intelligence-9780190908324">Birth of Intelligence</a></em> <strong>Daeyeol Lee </strong><br />What is intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? In <em>Birth of Intelligence</em>, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673">How (not) to train the brain</a></em><em> </em><strong>Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg" width="143" /></strong><br />Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051">The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory</a></em> <strong>Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham </strong><br />This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833">Musical Illusions and Phantom Words</a></em> <strong>Diana Deutsch <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png" width="145" /> </strong><br />Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882">Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</a></em><em> </em><strong>Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald </strong><em><br />Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</em> takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992">The Elephant in the Brain</a></em> <strong>Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg" width="145" /></strong><br />Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794">Your Brain on Food, Third Edition</a></em> <strong>Gary L. Wenk </strong><br />This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d">Are some foods better to eat after brain injury</a>?</li></ol><p>These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/" rel="nofollow">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-work-conditions-shape-healthcare/" rel="nofollow">How work conditions shape healthcare</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There are plenty of things you can do in a five minute break at work — talk to a colleague, make a cup of tea or coffee, or even go outside for some fresh air. But with the advent of digital technology, many of us now spend the short lulls in our day doing something else: looking at our phones.</p>
<p>Previous research has already suggested (fairly unsurprisingly) that smartphone use increases as we get more bored or fatigued. It makes sense: if you’re doing a particularly tedious task at work, you’re much more likely to want to spend a few minutes scrolling on your phone than if you’re doing something deeply engaging.</p>
<p>But does looking at your phone actually <em>relieve</em> boredom? A new study from Jonas Dora and colleagues at Radboud University, available as a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs">preprint at </a><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs"><em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, seems to suggest not.</p>
<p><span id="more-39336"></span></p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether smartphone use would increase or decrease fatigue and boredom. On one hand, previous research suggests that notifications significantly impact people’s ability to concentrate on major tasks; on the other, looking at your phone could provide what the authors refer to as a “microbreak”, allowing a small period in which to recover from the demands (and boredoms) of work.</p>
<p>To explore this relationship further, the team asked 83 participants to rate their level of fatigue and boredom every hour they were at work for three working days. An app had also been installed on their phones, which monitored smartphone use during the twenty minutes before and twenty minutes after these self-reports (times that overlapped with the start of end of work, or with lunch breaks, were omitted from analysis).</p>
<p>Phone breaks were extremely frequent: in the twenty minutes following each questionnaire, participants picked up their phone 52% of the time, spending an average of around ninety seconds on it each time.</p>
<p>As participants’ fatigue and boredom increased, so too did the frequency with which they looked at their phones. For instance,  a ten-point increase in boredom, on a 100-point scale, resulted in a 40% higher likelihood someone would reach for their phone (though there was no evidence that they spent any <em>longer </em>looking at their smartphones).</p>
<p>So did participants feel less bored after picking up their phones? Surprisingly, this wasn’t the case. Researchers looked at fatigue levels twenty minutes before self-reports, finding participants actually reported <em>higher</em> levels of boredom after having used their smartphones (though the effect size was admittedly small — a single digit increase on the 100-point scale).</p>
<p>There are two reasons why this might be the case. Switching between tasks — even between a boring task and an enriching one — can carry a cognitive load of its own, with the reward of a brief glance at a phone not enough to make up the deficit. And rather than being a motivating break, looking at a phone may simply underline the gap between the things you find taxing and the things you find invigorating — thus making you even more fed up and bored when you return to work.</p>
<p>This research had a small sample size, so it’s important not to draw too many definitive conclusions from its findings. But it’s not the only study to find a negative relationship between smartphone use and boredom levels. One <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/11/put-it-away-spending-work-breaks-on-your-smartphone-is-not-rejuvenating/">2016 paper</a> found that spending work breaks on the phone can lead to decreased levels of motivation: because you’re not allowing your mind to wander when you look at your phone, it suggested, you’re not getting any of the benefits you normally would during a break from work.</p>
<p>So next time you’re bored and feel yourself reaching for your smartphone, it might be an idea to resist it. Leaving your desk or even just looking out of the window for five minutes may be less compelling than what’s on your newsfeed — but you may find yourself less tired, less bored and less demotivated in the end.</p>

Last year, JAMA Ophthalmology published a study that claimed to find a link between using cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins and a reduced risk of glaucoma. In a New York Times story on the paper, lead author Jae H. Kang, an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, suggested that statins … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/16/statins-may-cut-glaucoma-risk-said-a-ny-times-headline-turns-out-thats-not-true/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">“Statins May Cut Glaucoma Risk,” said a New York Times headline.

<p>I've been using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> for a <a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html">while now</a>.
It allows me to stick to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.byobu.org/">Byobu</a> based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc">hooks</a>. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.</p>
<p>The simple <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using <code>:r &lt;filename&gt;</code>. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script">Vim script</a> a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:</p>

        echo <span class="s2">"Available signature files:\n"</span> . globpath<span class="p">(</span>sigdir<span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'*.sig'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>So, adding this to <code>~/.vimrc</code> would let one run <code>:call
LoadSignature('signature')</code> in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a <code>.sig</code> file extension in the location given by
<code>sigdir</code>, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.</p>
<p>It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.</p>

<p><strong>A world-wide survey of dog owners has investigated how common anxiety-related behaviours are in different breeds</strong>, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/your-dog-anxious-genes-common-its-breed-could-play-role">reports Michael Price</a> at <em>Science</em>. About a third of all dogs displayed noise sensitivity (e.g. during fireworks and thunder), and many were scared of other dogs, strangers or new situations. But the pattern of anxiety varied between breeds: Labradors were barely ever wary of strangers, for instance, while Lagotto Romagnolos were particularly scared of loud noises.</p>

But as we learn or develop new language and wrap our heads around new concepts, Wu writes, we “give meaning to walks of life previously starved of recognition”.</p>

<p><strong>Also at <em>Aeon</em>: <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/testosterone-is-widely-and-sometimes-wildly-misunderstood">Matthew Gutmann breaks down some of the myths</a> about testosterone</strong>, writing that early studies on the effects of testosterone were fatally flawed — and that the hormone has been used at times as an excuse for men’s behaviour.</p>

<p>As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.</p>
<p>Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”</p>
<p>At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.</p>
<p>While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we’ve added a<a href="https://status.arxiv.org"> status page</a> that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent<a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/"> blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding during this complicated moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, PLOS joins a list of endorsers of the </span><a href="https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Position Statement on Open Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated by </span><a href="https://openpharma.blog/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Pharma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of pharmaceutical clients, publishers, patients, academics, regulators, editors, non-pharmaceutical funders, and societies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS is a fully Open Access publisher, with all content published with a CC-BY license. We are  therefore ready to support the aims of Open Pharma without delay or need to alter policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We support any and all moves to open science, and to improve the integrity of research. The pharmaceutical industry </span><a href="https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funds roughly half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all biomedical research, yet has been slower to adopt the Open Access and Open Science policies that are now becoming mainstream. Our hope, by endorsing this position statement, is to ensure the pharmaceutical industry understands it is just as welcome and able to submit to PLOS journals as any other research group. Our robust editorial policies, open data policy, and Open Science mission will help the industry validate and demonstrate the credibility of its work.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There’s been a lot of back and forth about the psychological effects of taking and sharing selfies. Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149282">research</a> suggests that taking pictures of yourself can dent your self-esteem and increase anxiety, while <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJM-07-2015-0512/full/html">other studies</a> have found that selfies can be a source of empowerment; one <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> even found a combination of the two, suggesting that sharing selfies online can mitigate the damage to self-image often inflicted when a selfie is actually taken.</p>
<p>The hundreds of op-eds, articles and TV features that continue to focus on the issue also suggest that our interest in the phenomenon is unlikely to abate any time soon. And now a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482798.2019.1697319">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Children and Media</em> has added to the debate.</p>
<p>It suggests that <em>taking</em> selfies may not be as damaging as other research has claimed. Instead, it’s what you do after you’ve taken the photo that matters: it’s editing images that really hurts our self-esteem.</p>
<p><span id="more-39322"></span>Larissa Terán and colleagues at the University of Arizona first asked 278 teenage girls, aged 14 to 17, about their selfie activities. Participants rated how frequently they share selfies, and were then asked how often they edited their pictures using various different tools (e.g. getting rid of red eye, smoothing skin or making themselves look thinner using editing apps). They were then asked about selfie investment: how much effort and time they spent choosing photos of themselves to post online, as well as how concerned they were about the reception these posts receive.</p>
<p>Next, a questionnaire looked at self-objectification, a phenomenon in which people view themselves as objects rather than human beings. Participants were asked to select how much they identified with statements including “looking attractive to others is more important to me than being happy with who I am” and “I try to imagine what my body looks like to others”.</p>
<p>Participants were then given questions on appearance anxiety, rating how tense they feel when people look at them or when they feel they are being negatively perceived, as well as questions on how ashamed they feel about their appearance and on how they would evaluate their own looks.</p>
<p>As hypothesised, those who spent more time editing, thinking and worrying about selfies were more likely to see themselves as objects than those who did not. This self-objectification, in turn, was linked to greater anxiety and body shame amongst participants, and worse evaluation of their own looks. That is, people who invested more into thinking about or editing selfies tended to have more negative feelings about their own body — and that seemed to be because they were prone to self-objectification.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough — and as the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> also suggested — <em>sharing</em> selfies more frequently was not significantly associated with greater self-objectification nor with increased levels of body shame.</p>
<p>The authors have several suggestions as to why simply sharing selfies wasn’t related to negative body image. Pictures may not always be shared with appearance in mind: sometimes teens want to demonstrate who they’re friends with, what they’re interested in or what they’ve been doing. In fact, the team found some evidence that greater selfie sharing was linked to <em>better</em> self-image — meaning posting pictures of oneself might actually <em>decrease</em> shame about looks.</p>
<p>Whether there is actually a causal relationship between these factors, however, is not so clear. It could be that editing selfies contributes to concerns about appearance — that the process of editing, in other words, actively increases body shame. But there is also a distinct possibility that those who <em>already</em> have negative body image are more likely to edit pictures in the first place: their self-esteem is already wavering or low, so they feel the need to edit out hated flaws.</p>
<p>If the results truly are reflective of how teenage girls perceive their selfie taking activities, it may be more accurate to say that the <em>context</em> in which selfies are taken and shared are more important than anything inherent to the act itself. So rather than condemning teenage girls for taking selfies — or banning them from taking them, if you’re a parent — it may be more useful to understand <em>why</em> they’re doing it in the first place.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/World-Kidney-day-2020-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide.  This global health burden continues to increase each year.  There are no symptoms in early CKD.  It is not until CKD has progressed to the point of needing dialysis that patients develop recognizable symptoms.  This means that it is vital that patients are screened for CKD, since early diagnosis can prevent the progression of kidney disease.  <strong><a href="https://www.worldkidneyday.org/2020-campaign/2020-wkd-theme/">World Kidney Day</a></strong> on 12th March 2020 will focus on <strong>“Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – from Prevention to Detection and Equitable Access to Care”</strong>.  Primary care providers (PCPs) are on the frontline against CKD progression by making the early diagnosis.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01731-x">systematic review</a> by Neale <em>et al., </em>published today in <em>BMC Nephrology,</em> evaluated the barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.  Most reviews focus on barriers<em> or</em> enablers but this article was able to address both, which go hand-in-hand in helping PCPs tackle the growing health burden of CKD.  Twenty studies were included in the review. The most common barriers identified were lack of time, fear of delivering the CKD diagnosis, and dissatisfaction with CKD guidelines.  The most common enablers were the presence of supportive technology to identify and manage CKD and collaborative relationships among members of the healthcare team. These and some other identified barriers and enablers from Neale <em>et al. </em>are listed in table 1.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies to Enhance Early Detection and Management</strong></h3>
<p>Healthcare professionals frequently complain of the inadequate amount of time they can spend with patients. However, PCPs have one of the highest workloads, managing preventative care, acute complaints, multiple co-morbidities, etc.  Developing strategies to streamline the identification and management of CKD through electronic medical records and increasing the use of calculators for estimated GFR and kidney failure risk would benefit PCPs.  In addition, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/350/bmj.h176.full.pdf">adopting policies</a> that enable longer consultations for complex patients will allow protected time to deal with the management of chronic diseases like CKD.</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective co-management of patients with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Improving CKD knowledge and confidence in diagnosis will empower PCPs to provide early diagnosis.  If patients know they have CKD in the primary care setting, they can take steps to increase their own CKD knowledge and self-management of CKD, promoting future favorable outcomes. <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0272638614010610?token=595049B828280D60DE74EE3A6F2A4F0DFFA62F5357753C421BE25E03C6210DA1999D18113CA869B6495D8EF3AB581D07">One study</a> implemented a toolkit to enhance awareness of CKD among PCPs.  This quality improvement activity led to greater identification of CKD, increased referral to nephrology, increased communication among PCPs and nephrologists, and the development of co-management plans. Toolkits like this one should be used more frequently for providing continuing education and resources for our PCPs.</p>
<p>Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidities, but practice guidelines that consider the co-morbid nature of CKD would increase understanding and use among PCPs.  It will help with prioritizing the patient’s problem list and management strategies.  One potential solution is to develop guidelines that consider common clusters of chronic conditions. <a href="http://www.european-renal-best-practice.org/content/erbp-documents-topic">ERBP</a>, <a href="https://kdigo.org/guidelines/">KDIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.kidney.org/professionals/guidelines/guidelines_commentaries">KDOQI</a> have already started to address this by providing guidelines on CKD and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>PCPs and nephrologists working together in a multi-disciplinary team to care of these complex patients can only lead to future healthcare benefits.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about the paper "Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Does the language that you speak influence what you think? And do languages that assign a gender to most nouns — such as French and Spanish — lead speakers to feel differently about women versus men, compared with languages that don’t — such as Chinese? Both questions have been hotly debated. But now a major <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspa0000188">new study</a>, involving an analysis of millions of pages of text in 45 different languages from all over the world, concludes that gendered languages shape prejudice against women.</p>
<p><span id="more-39315"></span>Gendered languages, such as French and Spanish, Russian and Hindi, dictate that most nouns are male or female. For example, “the ball” is<em> la pelota</em> (female) in Spanish and <em>le ballon</em> (male) in French. In these languages, adjectives and verbs also change slightly depending on the gender of the noun. Then there’s a group of “natural gender” languages, in which nouns aren’t gendered, but pronouns do reflect gender (such as <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> in English, which belongs to this group.) Finally, there are genderless languages, in which a pronoun can refer to either gender, such as Chinese and Finnish.</p>
<p>Earlier research has found that in countries where gendered languages are spoken, women earn lower wages and are less likely to succeed in politics. But researchers have questioned whether the nature of the language itself has anything to do with this. Perhaps, some have suggested, languages simply reflect differences in broader cultural attitudes to men and women.</p>
<p>In the new study, David DeFranza and colleagues at the University of Utah used a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse vast amounts of text taken from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project, which holds snapshots of text taken from the internet since 2013, comprising more than 630 billion words. Text in 45 different languages, which include the first or second languages of more than half of the world’s population, were included.</p>
<p>The NLP software scanned these texts, looking for close co-occurrences of gender words (such as <em>woman</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>hers</em>, <em>her</em> and <em>man</em>, <em>he</em>, <em>his</em>, <em>him</em> in English) and positive or negative terms. The list of positive terms included <em>love</em>, <em>pleasure</em> and <em>lucky</em>, for example, while the negative terms included <em>abuse</em>, <em>sickness</em> and <em>ugly</em>.</p>
<p>The team found that the gendered languages were much more likely to show skewed associations, with more positive terms being associated with men than with women. For example, in the Commons Crawl component of the study, 19 of the 28 gendered languages used in this analysis — 67% — showed this pattern, whereas none of the 17 genderless languages did.</p>
<p>Various geographic, cultural and demographic factors have been shown to influence gender equality. But the team did control for various of these factors in their analysis (for example, they used data from the Global Gender Gap index developed by the World Economic Forum and the Human Development Index, developed by the UNDP), and the effect still held. “Using languages that span continents and cultures, we find evidence that gender prejudice exists more in gendered languages,” they conclude.</p>
<p>A further analysis used a similar method to explore gender stereotypes within these languages. The team found that in gendered, but not genderless, languages, male words, more than female words, were associated with being “competent”, “skilful” and “confident” (attributes traditionally associated more with men than women) but also “warm” (which traditionally has been associated more with women). In gendered languages, men are seen in a more positive light, overall, it seems.</p>
<p>What might explain this pro-male bias?</p>
<p>The researchers speculate that as gendered languages personify even inanimate objects with a specific gender, the regular use of such terms could frequently, unconsciously reinforce implicit attitudes about men and women. So, if men are traditionally viewed in a more positive light, using masculine nouns could bring to mind the positive associations regarding masculinity and reinforce a pro-male bias. If this is how the effect works, then the broader attitudes of a culture are clearly important, but language type has its own role to play.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the study. Most notably, this is an analysis of written text on the internet. Perhaps it doesn’t accurately reflect the attitudes of societies more broadly. However, this text was voluntarily produced by millions of people, and it’s debatable whether studies that involve asking people what they think are better at revealing actual beliefs. Indeed, the researchers argue that their work shows the value of analysing the extraordinary amounts of text held in Wikipedia and Common Crawl for research in social psychology.</p>
<p>Future studies could explore whether other stereotypes, not considered in this study — such as weakness vs power, home vs career, or perceptions of emotional versus rational decision-making — might show different patterns of gender association in gendered vs genderless languages, the team suggests.</p>

<p><strong><em>A case of genetic testing</em></strong></p>
<p>Samila* had been suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion when, at the age of 19, she was diagnosed with a heart that did not pump properly. Attempting to understand what caused this condition, her cardiologist suggested genetic testing. The test showed no underlying genetic factors for her heart issues and her medication was so effective that Samila thought it all might have been a fluke. However, when she was 26, her cardiologist unexpectedly contacted her with some upsetting information: part of her DNA had been identified as being involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>*<em>Fictionalized case</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Genetic testing: uncertainty amidst possible expectations of certainty </em></strong></p>
<p>A genetic test inspects parts or even the entirety of the genome, which contains all our hereditary information encoded in the DNA.</p>
<p>The field of human genetics studies the workings of human genomes and how variations within it might play a role in the development of medical conditions. Through these studies, our genes can offer us important insights into why we have developed certain conditions, whether we could develop them in the future, and whether our children are at increased risk of developing them.</p>
<p>We frequently attribute a great deal of certainty to genetic testing and the information it produces in terms of what it can tell us regarding current and future health risks. However, for all our expectations, the connection between our genes and discuss our health is anything but clear-cut. The information provided by genetic testing often contains a multitude of uncertainties.</p>
<p>One such uncertainty is that the meaning of genetic information can change over time. Depending on the moment a genetic test is performed or its data interpreted, patients may receive different results. This can be unsettling for patients and pose a real challenge to genetic professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stable genomes, changing understandings</em></strong></p>
<p>People change, their genomes do not. Our genome is inherited at conception and generally stays constant beyond the day we die. Patients like Samila may, therefore, wonder why they receive new genetic information many years later after their DNA was initially “cleared”. Despite its fixed nature, our understanding and interpretation of the genome is anything but stable.</p>
<p>Genetic testing enables us to inspect an individual genome for variations that differ from a template (i.e. ‘the’ human reference genome). Everyone has millions of variations that differ from this reference, but most are harmless or even beneficial. For patients, then, we need to establish whether these variations can explain or predict conditions or whether they are innocent.</p>

<p>In this sense, geneticists are kind of molecular detectives. They uncover evidence in order to ascertain whether their “suspects” – i.e. variations in an individual’s genome – are guilty or innocent regarding the development of specific conditions.</p>
<p>Complicating the task of reviewing evidence, like in an actual criminal investigation, is that new evidence might unfold as time passes. This new evidence may redefine how genetic variation might be involved in medical conditions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, for instance, it was uncertain if some of the initially identified genetic variation was harmless or suspicious. But as time went on, more patients with the same condition appeared to have this genetic variation, which indeed could be associated with cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p><strong><em>New evidence: important implications for patients</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11759" style="width: 270px;"><img alt="Guilty gene" class="wp-image-11759 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-2-260x300.jpg" width="260" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">New evidence can change the “verdict” that is given to genetic variation. <em>Illustration by Julia El Mecky</em>.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Evolving genetic evidence can have significant implications for patients and their relatives in terms of treatment decisions, medical protocols, and life decisions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, this new interpretation indicated a chronic heart condition that was likely to progress, irrespective of any treatment. Samila was advised to look for a job that was not too stressful. Her children have a 50% chance of having the genetic variation, putting them at higher risk of developing a similar condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Challenges for professionals in genetic healthcare</em></strong></p>
<p>New genetic technologies produce information regarding genetic variation at unprecedented rates, continuously providing new data on the relationship between genetic variation and medical conditions as time moves on.</p>
<p>The changing nature of genetic knowledge raises highly challenging questions for professionals.</p>
<p>For instance, a laboratory geneticist’s role is to interpret the meaning of genetic variation. What are their responsibilities with respect to identifying and providing up-to-date, important health information to individuals who have been tested in the past?</p>
<p>If laboratories would enact a policy of routinely inspecting all new evidence and update the interpretation of genetic data in their registry, patients such as Samila could receive vital medical information at an earlier time. Samila might then have considered measures to prevent her children from inheriting the genetic variation.</p>
<p>However, the workload for professionals to review massive amounts of new evidence is exorbitant and would strain resources, potentially cutting into time spent on other healthcare-related activities. Should the responsibility therefore lie with Samila or her primary care practitioner to regularly request updated interpretations?</p>
<p>It is crucial that these issues are explored through research that includes the perspectives of those involved. Our <a href="https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">study </a>looks at these questions in the context of the genetic laboratory. We invite everyone interested to read this paper, which raises important points of consideration for clinical genetics practice.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>When studying for exams, it can be tempting to just re-read textbooks or attempt to memorise your notes. But psychologists know that there are actually much more effective ways of learning — they just require a bit of extra effort.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3639?af=R">recent paper</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology </em>has highlighted two of these superior strategies. The team finds that university students whose revision involves testing themselves or making up questions about course material perform better in a later exam than those who simply restudy their notes.<span id="more-39311"></span></p>
<p>Past research had already shown that generating questions or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/09/the-digest-guide-to-studying/">being tested</a> during the learning process helps people retain information better than passively trying to absorb knowledge. These strategies are considered “desirable difficulties” that make the learning process harder or more effortful, but which are ultimately beneficial. But many previous studies only examined people’s ability to learn in the lab, or had tested them very soon after the learning phase. In real life, of course, people learn in places like schools and universities, and tests may occur days or weeks after studying.</p>
<p>So Mirjam Ebersbach and colleagues from the University of Kassel decided to test the effectiveness of these strategies in an actual educational context. The team recruited 82 German university students in a developmental psychology lecture and assigned them to one of three conditions. All three groups were given a print-out of 10 slides from the lecture (which was about the development of knowledge in infants), but each group studied the material in different ways. The “restudy” group was told to simply memorise the content of each slide. The “testing” group was given a question for each slide which they had to answer (they were allowed to look at the content in the slides if they weren’t able to answer initially). Finally, the “generating questions” group had to come up with test questions themselves, based on the content of each slide.</p>
<p>A week later, participants were given a surprise exam based on the information they had studied. Students had to answer five factual questions that directly related to the content they had learned, as well as five “transfer” questions, in which they had to apply the knowledge to new contexts.</p>
<p>Overall, participants who had only restudied the material scored a little under 45% on the test. By contrast, those who had answered or generated questions during the learning phase scored 11 percentage points higher, on average. Both of these strategies were significantly better than restudying, but neither was better than the other.</p>
<p>When the researchers analysed scores on the factual and transfer questions separately, they found some preliminary evidence that the two methods produced better results than restudying for both kinds of question. This suggests that the strategies help people to not only learn facts, but also apply that knowledge to new contexts.</p>
<p>Of course, the study has some important limitations. Most notably, the sample size was very small — groups ranged from 22 to 30 participants — so it will be important to replicate the findings in larger samples. And, as the researchers point out, their participants were all university students and so were presumably fairly good learners, or at least had plenty of experience studying and sitting exams. It remains to be seen whether these strategies are just as helpful in real-life situations for younger people or those who face greater difficulty absorbing new information.</p>
<p>Still, the results have clear applications for those looking to boost their learning. “Our results suggest that the two learning strategies, which are both clearly more effective than simple restudying, can be recommended by (university) teachers to learners and can also be recommended for (self-regulated) learning,” the authors conclude.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Scrolling through Facebook or Instagram, it can be easy to feel drawn in by the people you follow. Whether it’s the brands they’re buying, the things they’re doing or what they’re wearing, it’s not uncommon to want to follow suit — they’re called “influencers” for a reason, after all.</p>
<p>This isn’t only true of those who are paid to influence, however: those we know in “real life” and follow on social media can also impact the decisions we make. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666319310359?via%3Dihub">new study</a> published in <em>Appetite</em><em>, </em>Lily Hawkins and colleagues at Aston University find that what we think our online friends are eating can influence how healthy (or not) our own diets are.<span id="more-39305"></span></p>
<p>The team asked 369 university students to fill in a survey about their perceptions of Facebook users’ food habits and preferences — how many servings of vegetables they believed an average Facebook user to eat every day, for example — and what they felt users’ food habits <em>should</em> be. They were also asked to rate how much they identified with the label of “Facebook user” themselves.</p>
<p>Next, a set of questions explored participants’ own eating styles: how able they feel to restrain themselves around food, how emotional their eating tends to be, and how often they engage in uncontrolled eating. They also filled in a food frequency questionnaire, which measured how often they ate various food types, and reported how many servings of fruit, vegetables and snacks they usually consumed.</p>
<p>Finally, the participants answered questions on their mood and appetite whilst completing the study, and on lifestyle factors like BMI.</p>
<p>The results showed that perceived norms amongst Facebook users did in fact predict how often participants ate fruit and vegetables. The more participants felt their Facebook friends were eating fruit and veg, the more they ate themselves. Meanwhile, participants’ consumption of unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks was influenced by how much they thought Facebook users <em>should</em> eat junk food.</p>
<p>How much Facebook users were perceived to <em>like</em> a particular food did not have a significant effect, however; participants’ own habits were only influenced by what they believed users were actually consuming, or should be consuming. That is, people tended to match whatever pattern of consumption they felt to be the norm.</p>
<p>Though our eating habits may be affected by perceptions of how other people are eating, the impact on our actual health may be limited: these perceptions were not linked to differences in participants’ BMI, a factor the team hopes to follow up on longer term.</p>
<p>The idea that online friends influence our lives so directly is compelling, but there were some notable limitations to the study. Firstly, only <em>perceived</em> norms were measured. What participants were actually seeing when they logged onto Facebook was ignored, but may prove to have an impact on what they were eating. And only 81% of participants were actually on Facebook — 19% didn’t have an account, so their perceptions of the average Facebook user may have missed the mark entirely.</p>
<p>Still, the study provides some insights into how perceptions of online norms influence the way we ourselves eat. It seems to differ depending on what’s being eaten. Healthy eating appears to be guided by other people’s behaviour, while our consumption of unhealthy foods is related to how likely we feel to be judged for our consumption — an effect that can be particularly potent online, the team suggests, where many of us feel a need for social acceptance.</p>
<p>This also suggests that social media could be used as a tool to “nudge” people into more healthy behaviours — potentially a useful public health intervention when it comes to encouraging healthy diets. But ensuring these nudges encourage positive behaviour, rather than shaming those who are more unhealthy, could be a factor worth further attention.</p>

<p><strong>Psychology news seems to be taking a backseat in the media this week as concerns about coronavirus mount around the world. </strong>But psychologists also have much to contribute when it comes to understanding the current crisis and our responses to it.<span id="more-39301"></span></p>
<p>At <em>BBC Future</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-covid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling">Bryan Lufkin examines the reasons that people panic buy</a>, a phenomenon that is leaving some supermarket shelves empty and making it harder for healthcare professionals to get goods they need, such as face masks. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/dont-let-coronavirus-tip-society-into-panic-say-psychologists">psychologists are urging authorities to prevent further anxiety and panic</a> by providing clear information and accounting for “herd behaviour”, Hannah Devlin reports in <em>The Guardian.</em></p>
<p>We’ve all been told to stop touching our faces — but although it seems like a simple preventative action, it turns out to be much easier said than done. At <em>The New York Times</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/health/stop-touching-your-face.html">Jenny Gross talks to psychologists and other academics</a> about some of the ways to stop the habit.</p>

<p><strong>In more uplifting news, scientists have found that humans are not the only creatures able to use statistical information to make decisions: so can kea, the mischievous alpine parrots native to New Zealand,</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-zealand-birds-show-humanlike-ability-make-predictions">reports Virginia Morell</a> at <em>Science</em>.  Researchers first taught kea that a black token was associated with food. They then showed the kea two transparent jars containing black and orange tokens, and removed a token from each with a closed hand. The kea tended to pick whichever hand had taken a token from the jar with the greater proportion of black to orange tokens, suggesting that they had used this statistical information to figure out which hand offered the best chance of getting a food reward.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to write a hit song, make sure to use the word “you” in it a lot. </strong>Researchers have found that songs that make it higher up the charts have a greater proportion of “you”s in them, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/people-like-songs-about-you">writes Neuroskeptic</a> at <em>Discover Magazine</em>. The team thinks this may be because hearing about “you” helps listeners to imagine the story of the song applying to someone in their own lives.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/qOI5SF_XHdE/">Your PLOS, New Logo</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/19432_text_animation_re-size-150x150.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to share a new logo and a new “look” for PLOS! The new visuals you’ll see are a reflection of a broader set of important changes happening here over the past few years. This post gives a little bit of context about the “why” behind this work (and for the design nerds  more keenly interested in the background and some of our process… this is for you!)</span></p>
<p><b>So much has changed… but our “look” hadn’t. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific communication has changed since PLOS’ original founding (transforming it has been our </span><a href="https://plos.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the very beginning). Open Access is no longer a new idea. And while PLOS remains one of the original pioneers of OA in the global north, Open Access itself is increasingly mainstream. Yet, our look, feel, and color palette has been static for 7+years. And the PLOS “globe” logo had been essentially unchanged since our founding in 2003. (That’s a long time!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a “look” true to PLOS’ roots, while truly visually new, felt daunting at times. Could we develop a visual brand reflective of the trust our communities place in us that ALSO shows our energy and willingness to break boundaries along the way? Can we capture both our expertise AND daring? And could our “look” channel the passion and excitement we experience daily in our work with researchers all over the world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We knew we wanted to maintain a connection between the old and new. This work hasn’t been about starting from scratch but about moving forward. Here’s a peek behind the scenes. </span></p>
<p><b>The design process</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were voracious in seeking out inspiration, resulting in many, many storyboards from our incredibly talented in-house designer (more about her later…). While we’d love to share all her research, here’s a snapshot of some of our favorite themes: </span></p>

</a><b>Use of overlapping shapes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve created interesting details by zooming in and out; layering colors and transparencies; and creating new, more complex shapes by overlapping simpler ones. This was inspired by our intersecting communities and the multiple ways we work with them!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s our logo’s journey, with the final result!</span></p>

Today’s launch is the beginning. Over the coming weeks and months, you’ll see all PLOS visuals and collateral evolve in line with this new direction!</span></p>

<p><b>About PLOS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We’ve been breaking boundaries since our founding in 2001. PLOS journals propelled the movement for OA alternatives to subscription journals. We established the first multi-disciplinary publication inclusive of all excellent research regardless of novelty or impact, and demonstrated the importance of open data availability. As Open Science advances, we continue to experiment to provide more opportunities, choice, and context for readers and researchers. </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/placenta-2433431_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Almost every animal on the planet which produces a placenta eats it after birth. There are only a few exceptions to this rule – aquatic animals, camels, and humans.</p>
<p>In fact, humans are so averse to eating our own placentas after birth that it has not been recorded by any culture anywhere in the world in all of human history. We have buried them, burned them and occasionally sold them as medicine to other people, but <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2010.524106?casa_token=FRqe63-3CvwAAAAA%3A8UeE7jzb_OoZFMOjR5MnZKqzSlvG2YrCDtoXn8r1cyYnXK-eA_RMtkOrxHGsOQXvEJa_c2T33oPU">as far as we know</a>, we have never routinely eaten our own. That is, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20">until the 1970s</a>, when the practice started spreading.</p>
<p>“Post-partum human maternal placentophagy” is the term for the phenomena of the birthing parent eating their own placenta after they have given birth. It is something which existing research indicates is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&amp;">done almost exclusively by married, heterosexual, middle- or upper-class white women in the Global North</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>But why?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to answer that question, we can look in the place where people are already talking about it: the internet. More specifically, <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2824-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our research</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, looked at threads posted on the UK parenting forums Mumsnet and Netmums and analysed them to see if common themes could be established.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parenting forums can be important spaces for women to seek advice, including about placentophagy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we found was that people usually decide to eat their placentas because they either previously had, or felt they were at risk of, a negative experience during birth and the post-partum period. Most commonly, these were women who had existing mental health problems or had previously experienced post-natal depression (PND) and were worried about a recurrence. PND can be an awful, isolating and stigmatized condition and people were willing to seek a broad range of possible preventative measures – including eating their placenta.</p>
<p>The rationale for this is that in the immediate postpartum period, the birthing parent experiences a large and sudden drop in pregnancy-related hormones that can result in low mood and energy. The placenta produces a lot of those hormones and so re-ingesting it could replace some of them. The theory is that taking placenta in the form of an encapsulated pill once or twice a day over a period of time can mitigate some of that loss and therefore reduce or treat depression, induce lactation, boost mood, reduce cramps, improve energy and so on. According to existing research, there is no evidence that this is true (and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519217302081?via%3Dihub">fairly good evidence</a> that it has no impact on these things), but that does not stop the popularity of the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Popularity of placentophagy</strong></h3>
<p>There are a few potential factors increasing this popularity. Nobody finds the idea of eating a placenta particularly appetizing. The practice of encapsulation (steaming and/or dehydrating, grinding up and placing the placenta into capsules) helps alleviate the potential unpleasantness, making the practice palatable to more people. This process costs somewhere between £100-400 to pay someone else to do. For those who are handy, there are DIY guides and kits that can be purchased online. Some may instead choose to mix the placenta with fruit in a smoothie, or consume it some other way, but encapsulation is by far the most popular method. The media attention on the topic has also helped push it into the public view and the internet is being used as a tool for sharing logistical information and overcoming potential barriers to practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Placentophagy can be understood as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The data we looked at also demonstrated that parenting forums can be important spaces for women to establish normative parenting values and seek advice, including about placentophagy. Whilst there were the expected jokes about it, there was also an emphasis on personal choice, bodily autonomy and the value of each other’s experiences to support those who had done or were considering the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Motivations and concerns</strong></h3>
<p>We conclude that placentophagy can be understood as being practiced as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth and the birthing experience. It is medically legitimized through its similarity to medication and the sterile procedures used to create the “pills,” yet there is also an element of eschewing medical or scientific advice and seeking knowledge from people who have been in the same situation.</p>
<p>There are some understandable concerns about the practice. Seeking to address the issue oneself may cause a delay in seeking treatment for PND or other post-natal problems and there is a small concern about potential infection risk if the process is not sterile. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/birt.12354">large medical records study in the USA</a> found no evidence of adverse outcomes associated with the practice, which is reassuring, but may not be applicable to other countries where methods may vary subtly or significantly. When it is brought up in clinical practice, healthcare professionals should be able to non-judgmentally and openly discuss with pregnant people the available medical evidence, or lack thereof, for placentophagy. They should also explore the reasons why someone might be considering it and if there is any additional support they want or need.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/03/04/rewriting-matlab-code-in-python/">Rewriting Matlab code in Python</a></h4>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>So you’re beginning to use Python daily. Great! You might still have a critical set of Matlab scripts from back in the day that doesn’t have a neat equivalent in Python. How do you rewrite this code in Python without introducing many headaches? I’ve had to do this a handful of times and have developed a method based on test-driven development that avoids the biggest issues in code translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what you want to translate</li>
<li>Create a test plan based on existing code</li>
<li>Write tests in Python</li>
<li>Write the code in Python</li>
<li>Iterate until tests pass</li>
</ol>
<p>To test the method, I’ve migrated a script that I found in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709635">Susillo and Abbott (2009)</a>. It simulates a chaotic neural network and trains it with recursive least-squares. I wanted to make sure I would run into issues (gotchas!) when I translated the code to exercise the method – and I did run into issues! The method I’m outlining highlighted the translation bugs early and helped squash them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is part 3 of my guide on transitioning from Matlab to Python. Read <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">part 1: a curriculum to learn Python</a> and <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">part 2: choosing environments, IDEs and packages</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pick your battles</h3>
<p>Algorithmic code that does matrix manipulation is typically a good candidate for translation into Python. Importantly, the code you will translate needs to currently run in Matlab, since we’re going to have to run the code and capture its current behaviour. <a href="https://realpython.com/build-python-c-extension-module/">Mex code can be repurposed pretty straightforwardly into a Python extension</a>, keeping the core C numerics intact.</p>
<p>Try to avoid direct translation of code with dependencies on Simulink, GUIDE, or esoteric toolboxes. For GUIDE in particular, I’ve found that the limitations of GUIDE enforce a certain style of coding – lots of globals and convoluted logic. You’re probably better off rewriting the GUI code from scratch than attempting direct translation.</p>
<p>Not every piece of Matlab code needs to be translated to Python. If your goal is to archive an existing pipeline so it continues to run despite deprecation, <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">containerizing Matlab with Docker</a> is a good route. You can also call legacy Matlab code from Python directly using the official Matlab engine for Python from Mathworks or using shell calls. However, some situations will <em>require</em> translating Matlab code, for instance, if you want to run your code in the cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, consider doing the process for a smaller project first. It’s not that easy! You will learn a lot from doing this once on a smaller scale. I recommend that you <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">create a git repo for your project and commit regularly</a>, because you might be doing a lot of iterations to get everything to run correctly.</p>
<h3>Creating a test-based strategy for rewriting the code</h3>
<p>We’ve identified a good script or function to rewrite. Should we start writing Python? No! It is very easy to rewrite code in another language that <em>seems</em> to work, but has subtle bugs. You can spend days or weeks chasing down these bugs, and it will drive you crazy! For this reason, we will use a test-based strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture what the behaviour of the code is <em>right now</em> for a variety of inputs.</li>
<li>Rewrite the code in Python and make sure it does exactly the thing that we want it to do. That is, for the same inputs, it gives us the same outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">We will create unit tests to verify the behaviour of our code is correct</a>, meaning that it matches the old code exactly. At this point, you may say – <em>hold on, I don’t just want to transfer the code over, I want to improve it</em>! Our goal is to capture the logic part of the code – the number-crunching. This does not stop us from improving the reference code in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making constants changeable</li>
<li>Making the code more modular</li>
<li>Using Pythonic data structures, for example using <code>pandas</code> to store time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, we have to build on a solid foundation – a reference. Once we replicate the original behaviour and commit it to a repo, we can improve it later in a new commit.</p>
<h3>Identify inputs and outputs</h3>
<p>We need to identify the inputs and outputs of the script or function we want to rewrite. One very nice thing about Matlab is that functions tend to be stateless and do not modify their arguments (unless an input is a reference object type, which is pretty rare). Thus, we can reason pretty easily about the inputs and the outputs to a function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inputs are the arguments.</li>
<li>The outputs are the return variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions may have side-effects, such as creating a plot or saving a file. A side-effect to a function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation</a>. If the code you’re translating has side-effects, you should aim to remove them.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function takes in data and returns nothing, saving the results to disk, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [] = mycomplexop(outfile)
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    save(outfile, 'data');
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can transform this into a side-effect-free function by returning the results instead of saving them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [data] = mycomplexop()
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    return
end
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer to comment out plotting code rather than trying to replicate it exactly. Again, we want to focus on the number crunching.</p>
<h3>Identify test cases</h3>
<p>Many Matlab scripts are written in a style where the inputs to a function are set up, a function or set of functions are called, and then the output is plotted. We need to capture the inputs to this set of functions as well as the inputs. An easy way to do this is using <code>save</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">% Set up the inputs.
t = 0:1000;
dt = .1;
g = 10;

save inputs.mat -hdf5

% Call the function
complexoutput = mycomplexfun(t, dt, g);

save outputs.mat -hdf5

% Plotting the output
plot(t, complexoutput);
</code></pre>
<p>I used Octave here – but you can use <code>-v7.3</code> rather than <code>-hdfd5</code> to save if you’re using Matlab. <code>mat</code> files saved in these formats are actually hdf5 files that Python can read.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to randomization. It will be hard to replicate Matlab’s random number generation exactly in Python. Ideally, functions should be independent of randomizations, because functions with random outputs are very hard to test for correctness. If a function requires random variables to implement an algorithm, we can circumvent this issue by giving the function the random data it needs. For example, let’s say we have a function that computes the distribution of the range of a random normal variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist()
    A = randn(100, 1000);
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite this function so that its source of randomness comes from outside the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist(A)
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can generate the <code>A</code> variable in a script, and save that particular random draw.</p>
<p>Make sure to pick test cases that won’t take more than a few seconds to run. You will be running your tests many times, and these seconds will add up! Toy data is fine. It’s also good practice to test our code on simple inputs where the correct output is clear, for example, all zeros, all ones, etc. Save as many input-output pairs as is necessary to capture the range of behaviours of functions you want to capture.</p>
<p>In addition to testing our script end-to-end, we may choose to test intermediate computations involved in the script. Testing more fine-grained computations will help you debug your code. If your function is already written as a function, it may call private functions – which can make things a bit tricky. You may need to refactor a bit of the Matlab code to make private functions public so that you can capture both their inputs and outputs.</p>
<h3>Writing a test scaffold</h3>
<p>Unit testing checks whether the results of a function are as expected given a set of inputs. Testing in Python can range from using simple inline <code>assert</code> statements to sophisticated automated solutions that check that tests pass every time you push code into your repo. In our case, we will use a lightweight manual testing method: hiding test cases behind <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code>.</p>
<p>We will create a python module that is meant to be imported, for example, via <code>import mymodule</code>. When we run the file on the command line, however, via <code>python module.py</code>, the code hidden behind this <code>if</code> statement will be run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def my_complex_fun(A):
    # Complicated things occur.
    return A * 2

def _run_tests():
    # Load inputs.
    with h5py.File('inputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        A = np.array(f['A/value'])

    with h5py.File('outputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        B_ref = np.array(f['B/value'])

    # Call the function.
    B = my_complex_fun(A)

    # Check shapes are good.
    assert A.shape == B.shape

    # Check values are similar.
    np.testing.assert_all_close(B, B_ref)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the tests.
    _run_tests()
</code></pre>
<p>The tests are inside the <code>_run_tests()</code> function. This way, the module namespace will not be polluted with variables that could have the same name as other variables inside of a function.</p>
<p>When the code is run, the tests should raise errors if the output is not as expected, which will stop execution. You will see a big old error on the command line, and then you know that you must correct the code. You can raise an error by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>assert</code> statement. It raises an error whenever the statement is False.</li>
<li>Using the methods in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html"><code>np.testing</code></a>. These methods can check whether, for example, the elements of numpy array are all close to a reference (within numeric error).</li>
<li>Using the <code>raise</code> statement to manually raise an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s really all you need to test code. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">Numerous unit-testing libraries in Python exist</a>, but at their core is the same idea: create code that raises an error when the output not what is expected.</p>
<h3>Picking organization</h3>
<p>Main effects are much easier to test than side effects in the unit-testing framework. You’ll often find yourself writing side-effect-free, modular and functional code for this reason. That’s great! You’ll tend to create smaller functions so that you can test each individual component. Your code will be easier to reason about.</p>
<p>The Python code you write may be objected-oriented. Although Matlab now has excellent support for classes, much Matlab code, especially older code, eschews the use of classes. If you don’t feel comfortable writing object-oriented code, don’t sweat it – Python code doesn’t have to use classes to be Pythonic. Classes make sense when something needs to remember and manage its own state. <a href="https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/">Here’s a tutorial on Python classes if it’s something that intrigues you</a>.</p>
<h3>Writing the code – common gotchas</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve picked our tests, and picked how we’ll organize our code, we can start coding. Matlab’s matrix operations naturally translate to Numpy. Be careful with these common gotchas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reshape operations will cause you headaches. Matlab uses Fortran order, Python uses C by default. This means in Matlab:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
A(:)

ans = 
    [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(A.ravel())
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Saving to hdf5 in Matlab and loading in Python will invert axes because of the distinction between C and Fortran order. You will have to swap axes front to back, for example. For example, if you save a three-dimensional tensor in Matlab <code>A</code> and then load it back in Python via hdf5, you will need to call <code>A.swapaxes((2, 1, 0))</code> to get back the original tensor.</li>
<li>Be careful with dimension-one vectors! If you have a one-dimension vector <code>a</code> of shape <code>(N, )</code>, then <code>a.dot(a.T)</code> gives you a vector of the shape <code>(N, )</code>. It will not be a scalar, nor a matrix. If you wanted to computed the outer product of <code>a</code> with itself, use <code>a.reshape((-1, 1)).dot(a.reshape((1, -1)))</code> or better yet <code>np.outer(a, a)</code>.</li>
<li>Hidden dot products can cause problems! The <code>*</code> operator applies to scalars and to vectors in Matlab, and the semantics are different depending on the dimension of the operands. <code>A.dot(B)</code> replace Matlab’s <code>A * B</code>. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/">You may also see <code>A @ B</code> being used but it’s still rather esoteric</a>. * Objects in Python have pass-by-reference semantics. Several methods in numpy modify data in place. Be careful! Sometimes, you will explicitly need to <code>copy()</code> your data.</li>
<li>Python uses 0-based indices and Matlab 1-based indices. Watch out!</li>
<li>Look at your data! Don’t fly blind!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write a piece of code that you suspect may cause a bug, you can use inline <code>assert</code> statements to make sure it works. I like to use this to check the dimensions of intermediate arrays, for example.</p>
<p>Some of the problems of direct index manipulation can go away by using <code>pandas</code> dataframes where appropriate. <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/"><code>xarray</code></a> uses named dimensions for tensors, which can help avoid many mistakes caused by the need for swapping axes and reshaping. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html"><code>np.einsum</code></a> can express complicated sums and products of tensors in an easy-to-read, less error-prone manner.</p>
<p>You might want to consider translating parts of your numerics to <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> directly, especially if you want to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Performance-sensitive code can be JIT’ed using <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a> or <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>, or rewritten in <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>. Start small and optimize as necessary.</p>
<h3>Using the method on a real script</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/original_force_external_feedback_loop.m">The example script I rewrote is about 165 lines of code</a>. It’s written in a pedagogic style and intersperses explanations, logic and plotting. In that sense, it’s similar to a jupyter notebook. I focused on transferring the logic of the main loop, which does a forward simulation of the network and trains it with the FORCE algorithm.</p>
<p>I had to change a handful of things related to plotting to get it to run in Octave, but I was able to get it to run within about 10 minutes. Not bad for 10-year code! The code is organized in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets up variables.</li>
<li>runs the body of the computation (a big <code>for</code> loop). This body has side effects (plotting).</li>
<li>finishes in an end state that contains the results of the computation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the code is not set up as a function, it was fairly easy to isolate the inputs are – they’re what the <code>for</code> loop needs to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x0</code>, <code>z0</code>, <code>wf</code>, <code>dt</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>ft</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And the outputs are the variables computed in the main for loop, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zt</code> and <code>w0_len</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I captured these inputs and outputs as a test case for my script. I commented out the forward simulation of the trained network that comes after the main for loop since it’s another logically separate component of the code that I could attack later.</p>
<p>In addition to the end-to-end result of the script, I captured the result of the first iteration of forwarding the network state, to create a more granular test. I also checked array dimensions.</p>
<p>I decided to write the code as a class, with methods <code>train</code> and <code>simulate</code>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The resulting code doesn’t look like Matlab code</a>. Yet, because I’d set up a test scaffold, I could be assured that it works the same as the old Matlab code.</p>
<p>Translation was hard! I ran into multiple very subtle issues translating the rather short code I was working (maybe 20 lines of real logic). The issues were subtle – incorrect manipulation of dimension-1 vectors, off-by-1 errors in a loop. Having reference code and functional tests allowed me to isolate these issues, fix them, and replicate the original functionality exactly. It took about 3 hours, which is a lot! I was very careful to set up a well-defined goalpost when I translated the code, so I knew when I would be done, which kept me going.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The translated code is available here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/Use%20chaotic%20RNN.ipynb">I imported the code into a notebook and generated some figures from it</a> – it runs!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using test-driven development, it’s possible to systematically, incrementally transfer legacy Matlab code to the Python environment. You can be assured that the code will <em>work</em> in the end because you will have defined what <em>working</em> means. You will have created a test suite for your code with good coverage for your new Python code. You might even have spotted subtle bugs in the original Matlab code along the way! Future you will thank you for your attention to detail.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/19954646-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As people grow older, they may experience changes in their memory, like forgetting an appointment or someone’s name, leading to concerns about their memory functioning. And older adults sometimes report having memory problems despite performing normally on memory tests, such as those conducted by their doctor. Even if cognitive testing is normal, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363073">subjective memory complaints</a> are important to consider as they might be an early indicator of more serious problems with memory and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623488">cognition</a> or psychological stress such as depression or anxiety. Older adults can have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215819">memory complaints</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880907">typical symptoms of depression</a>, making it difficult for healthcare providers to determine how these symptoms are related. It is unclear from the current research whether, in older adults with both depressive symptoms and memory complaints, depressive symptoms lead to problems with memory or whether the perception of memory problems contributes to the development of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>To better understand the order in which memory complaints and depressive symptoms occur, we need to see how these two symptoms develop within an individual over time. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1451-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we examine the development of depressive symptoms and memory complaints in two large groups of older adults across periods of 6-18 years.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>We used two large, publicly available datasets that together represented over 10,000 older adults from across the United States. These longitudinal datasets included measures of memory complaints and depressive symptoms, collected via interviews conducted every year or every other year for up to 18 years. Any older adult experiencing clinically significant changes in their cognition was removed from our study. This is important because individuals with cognitive impairment may not report memory complaints due to a lack of awareness of their memory problems.</p>
<p>Older adults reported their perceptions of their memory in two questions, one for current memory rating and one for memory decline over the past year or two years. The first question asked for a rating of their memory at the present time. A second question then asked whether they perceived their memory to be better, worse, or the same as it was the last time they were interviewed. For depressive symptoms, older adults indicated whether they had recently experienced a range of symptoms e.g., felt down, depressed or hopeless. We controlled for other personal characteristics that might influence depressive symptoms and/or memory complaints such as sex, education level, age, race/ethnicity, income, and marital status.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>We first examined whether memory complaints co-occurred with depressive symptoms. That is, at times when a person reported a memory complaint, did they report more depressive symptoms? In one of the two datasets, we found that at times when an older adult provided lower current memory ratings, they also reported more depressive symptoms. Importantly, we also found that at times when an older adult reported a decline in memory, they also reported more depressive symptoms at that same interview across both datasets.</p>
<p>We then examined whether memory complaints predicted future depressive symptoms. We found that older adults’ rating of their current memory at one interview was not related to their depressive symptoms at the next interview. However, when an older adult reported a decline in memory at one interview, they reported more symptoms of depression at the next interview across both datasets. Interestingly, this was not true in the other direction: current symptoms of depression did not predict future memory complaints.</p>
<h3><strong>What it means</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Memory complaints are often seen as a symptom of depression in older adults; however, our work suggests that this is not the case for all types of memory complaints. Older adults’ low rating of their memory performance can be related to depressive symptoms, but is not always. In contrast, older adults’ feeling of their memory getting worse over longer periods of time (e.g., a year or two) is consistently related to their current feelings of sadness and hopelessness as well as to increases in future depressive symptoms. Therefore, perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression. This may be because when an older adult feels like their memory is getting worse, they start to experience sadness or hopelessness about their memory, and what it means to grow older in general. Alternatively, for some older adults, perceiving that their memory is getting worse could also trigger fears about dementia or other aging-related disorders. It likely depends on the individual and their different experiences with aging and memory.</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical implications</strong></h3>
<p>Health care professionals working with older adults should consider asking them about how their memory is changing over time. These types of questions are necessary to understand how an older adult is currently feeling, but are also important for how they may be feeling at future appointments. This suggests that helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms and promote better psychological health and well-being.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Orienting yourself through Python</a></h4>

<p>I was surprised by the amount of positive response to my <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">last article on transitioning away from Matlab</a>. Many people are ready to switch – but they’re facing some significant challenges. One of the biggest things I’ve heard beginners say is that they are overwhelmed with the number of choices they have to make with Python. Python is open-source, has a decentralized contribution model, and has been around for more than 25 years. For everything that you can do one way in Matlab, there are at least 10 different ways of doing it in Python. Picking the best one is stressful!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>This is my rough guide to orienting yourself with Python. Don’t read it all in one go, it will make your head spin! The goal is not to overwhelm you with information, but to have this information as a reference when you’re ready to use it. The recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences. They’re written with the intent of minimizing the amount of research and pain you’ll have to go through as a beginner. Don’t agree? Post in the comments! Feedback is a gift.</p>

<h4>Which distribution should I choose?</h4>
<p>The Python distribution on the python.org website <em>does not</em> include a lot of core packages needed for data science. It also does not include a package manager. A package manager allows you to automatically download and install a set of scripts and modules of a specific version – a package. People recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">the Anaconda distribution</a>, which is more fully-featured. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.</li>
<li><code>ipython</code>, the interactive python console.</li>
<li>The <code>conda</code> package manager. Note that conda and the Anaconda distribution are two different (though similarly named) things.</li>
<li>Many of the core packages needed for data science.</li>
<li>An installer that sets your path correctly, which is especially important on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should pick the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">latest stable version of Python 3 that conda comes in, in its 64-bit incarnation</a>. Python 2 has been deprecated for several years, and you should not be using it.</p>
<h4>Which package manager should I use?</h4>
<p>When you try to install packages like <code>tensorflow</code> and <code>pytorch</code>, you’ll quickly find that there are often two ways to install the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip</code>: the lightweight package manager. Originally pip could only install Python packages, but these days it can install non-Python system-wide dependencies to Python packages.</li>
<li><code>conda</code>: the heavy-duty package manager. It’s not just for Python, it’s for everything! This includes Python packages with weird dependencies, R and Julia packages, text editors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, packages will tell you how you should install them. Just follow the instructions. In either program manager, the process is similar: open the command line, type in a command, for example:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pytorch
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<p><code>conda install pytorch</code></p>
<p>Then confirm, and wait for the install to finish. No need to set the path or anything. Generally, I find that conda is slower but it can install a wider range of things.</p>
<h4>Where should I install my packages?</h4>
<p>When you install a package in Python, you can either install it in the base (or root) environment or in a custom environment.</p>
<p>&gt; A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.</p>
<p>If you’re coming from the Matlab world, you know all the annoyances that come with managing the path. Imagine removing the path and replacing it wholesale when you switch projects. That’s sort of what environments do in Python. Another metaphor you might like is a virtual machine or a container. It’s a little sandbox in which you can put packages. If you bonk your environment, you delete it and create a new one. No need to reinstall your computer!</p>
<p>There are a few different environment managers, but since you installed Anaconda (above) and you have <code>conda</code> installed, you want to use <code>conda</code> environments. When you get started, you can put everything in the <code>base</code> environment. Later on, you’ll find this limiting (maybe you’ll have messed up your install with incompatible dependencies after a bit), so you’ll create another environment, perhaps called <code>py3</code>. Later still, you might start creating one environment per project (with its own Github repo!).</p>
<p>Packages that have very specific sets of dependencies will sometimes ask you to recreate an environment <em>exactly</em>. In that case, follow the instructions to the letter; the package probably needs an old version of a package or has esoteric system-wide dependencies that you will waste hours trying to track down. <a href="https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md">One package that requires this is DeepLabCut</a>.</p>
<h4>Which packages should I install?</h4>
<p>Many of the packages included by default in anaconda are your standard bread-and-butter for data science, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these packages has millions of users, they are very active and they’re supported by grants and commercial entities. You can rely on them. I also list <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">well-supported packages for neuroscience</a> in the previous article.</p>
<p>What about more esoteric needs? How do I intuit whether I’m going to waste a bunch of time on a package that doesn’t work? Here are a few heuristics:</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><ul>
<li>How many stars does it have on Github (1 in the above picture)? If it has 1k+ stars, it’s a very well-used project. If it’s smaller than 100 – beware.</li>
<li>When is the last commit on Github (2 in the above picture)? If it’s more than a year, chances are the package is abandoned. This may make it difficult to install.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask! Ask your labmates, on Twitter, on your favorite Discourse or at a local meetup. Use whatever everybody else is using – this way, it will be easier to get support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which IDE should I use?</h4>
<p>There are two categories of integrated development environment for Python:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code editors. You edit code that you can run from inside the editor. Code editors will have a file explorer, variables explorer, a plotting window, a console window, a graphical debugger, etc. These programs can approximate more or less faithfully the experience you have with Matlab. In some cases, they offer many, many more features. They run as standalone programs on your computer.</li>
<li>Notebook editors. You edit a visual document consisting of cells that can be run in any arbitrary order. Plots are saved inline and code can be interspersed with formatted text and formulas. Notebooks run inside in your browser and can connect to remote workers (Python doesn’t have to be on your computer, it can be in the cloud).</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked on Twitter what people tend to use, and it’s fairly evenly split. Many commented that they use both code editors and notebook editors in their day-to-day work. If I want to train a deep neural net for example, I might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script in a code editor, testing it on toy data with the built-in command line</li>
<li>Run the script inside of a terminal overnight</li>
<li>Analyze the results inside of a notebook the next day.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019">Here is a very good article that weighs all the different options</a> – it’s long! Here is my current hot take:</p>



<ol><li>Code editors: <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder is the most bare-bones IDE of the bunch, and approximates Matlab well</a>. It’s a great starter IDE. I love Atom in general but I find <a href="https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html">Hydrogen</a>‘s lack of a console limiting. I prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python">the Python extension</a>. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is by far the most advanced editor, with intelligent inferences on your code and automated fixes that feel like magic. It can also be overwhelming because it has so many features, and it also isn’t free (a license is 89$ a year). If you spend 8 hours a day doing Python, PyCharm might the editor for you.</li><li>Notebook editors: <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyterlab</a> does everything jupyter does and more. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true">Colab</a> adds sharing capabilities, and you can use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/colabs">free-tier TPU</a> with it.</li></ol>



<h4>Which GUI toolkit should I use?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7290" data-attachment-id="7290" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gui-toolkits" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png" data-orig-size="1030,526" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/gui-toolkits/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" /></figure>



<p>I asked on Twitter recently, and it seems that many people are choosing <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQt5</a> to build desktop applications. Qt has a very nice builder to graphically design your GUI, as well as code generators to eliminate writing your own boilerplate. wxPython is also well-loved for larger-scale applications, while tkinter doesn’t have quite all the knobs and options you’d want for a fully-fledged app.</p>



<h4>PyTorch or Tensorflow?</h4>



<p>That’s a tough one! I’ve worked with both in a professional setting at Google and Facebook. As an end-user, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is generally considered to be easier to use. <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> has a lot of support for advanced features, like probabilistic programming, and is used by downstream libraries for this reason, for example in the up-and-coming PyMC4. If you use Tensorflow, you probably want to start with <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, which has a higher-level API.</p>



<h4>What about plotting? How do I make nice figures?</h4>



<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><code>matplotlib</code> is the package that most people start with</a>. Its API is very similar to Matlab, by design. It creates plots which are not very aesthetically pleasing, by default, but <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html">you can easily improve them by using seaborn’s styling</a>:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

<p>Many other packages build on <code>matplotlib</code>, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><code>seaborn</code></a>, which includes a number of useful plot types, including violin plots and histograms.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine"><code>plotnine</code></a>, which implements the grammar of graphics (<code>ggplot2</code> in R).</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of up-and-coming visualization libraries that are not using matplotlib under the hood. The one with the most support behind it is <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py">plotly</a>. It creates interactive plots that can be shared easily, includes support for other languages outside of Python, and is supported commercially by the plotly company.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Picking up Python can feel overwhelming as an outsider – so many decisions to make! I was endlessly reading through articles and doing comparison shopping when I was starting out. Picking what others around you are already using will help you get support when you’re starting out. Ask around! Enjoy the ride!</p>

What carers need and how technology can help provide it</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Support_5504-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Family carers are often invisible to the health care system in meeting the care needs of older people. Yet, family carers – people who assist a family member or friend with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging – <a href="https://healthcouncilcanada.ca/files/HCC_HomeCare_FA.pdf">provide three-quarters of the care older adults receive</a>. Demands on family carers are <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/Q326-4625-5753-K683">increasing</a> as populations age, disability rates increase, and demands on our health and continuing care sectors escalate. In these circumstances, sustainability of family care becomes a pressing issue.</p>
<p>To better understand family caring roles, and how technology might support them, we conducted focus groups and an online survey with carers in Canada. As reported in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we learned that family carers want to enhance the care they currently provide, but they recognize that they have to protect their own capacity to care first.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting family carers’ well-being</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11737 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/2_0020-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To protect their own well-being, and their ongoing capacity to provide care, family carers want to take better care of themselves, develop better coping strategies, and have opportunities for mentorship and socialization.</p>
<p>Family carers sought more time and space for themselves as part of their overall sustainability. <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/ijcc/2019/00000003/00000003/art00009">Sustainability </a>in this context refers to carers’ ability to balance the demands of caring for their loved ones without jeopardizing their own health, well-being, and quality of life. This is easier said than done as carers struggle to find a few hours to care for themselves as individuals with their own interests and needs while caring for others. Developing better coping strategies and becoming more resilient is a learned skill. Rebalancing the negative and positive aspects of caregiving, focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress, and celebrating small victories can help reframe the emotional experience of caregiving. As one carer put it,</p>
<p><em>“If caregivers had time off, their health would hopefully remain good. Currently, burnout and health implications are inevitable.”</em></p>
<p>Yet, at times, family carers feel guilty about putting their own needs first. They want <em>“better networking with other caregivers, sharing our stories to make things easier,” </em>and reducing the social isolation they often experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhancing family carers’ capacity to provide quality care</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance caregiving capacity, family carers want information about their care receivers’ conditions to help them plan, and the ability to navigate existing resources, programs and supports.</p>
<p>Knowing “what comes next” is a central desire for many family carers, so that they can plan for an unpredictable future, manage expectations, and make informed decisions. Having this sense of control contributes to their overall well-being. One carer wished for</p>
<p><em>“…a crystal ball so I know what the future might look like, so I can prepare more for what might be required as we go forward.”</em></p>
<p>Family carers also feel lost, navigating fragmented health and social support services without a road map. They may not know what supports and programs are available or whether they qualify for any they do know about. Making sense of the flood of online information is overwhelming in the face of family carers’ time-consuming care responsibilities. Another carer described the situation as follows:</p>
<p><em>“It is like a library with the books in a pile on the floor and no card catalogue to even let me know where to start.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Targeted technology development can help carers achieve their goals</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11738 alignright" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Jacquie-and-Gigi-Dec04_51040-300x199.jpg" width="300" />
<p>When considering technology development to support carers, traditional problem‐focused approaches to technology design can limit discussions to performing caregiving tasks, failing to capture the relational and emotional aspects of caregiving. While technology is not the panacea that product developers and policy makers hope for, family carers did offer suggestions about how they are, or could be, using technology to enhance and preserve their caregiving capacity. Some carers use off-the-shelf technology to support their caregiving.</p>
<p><em>“My [Smart] watch tells me to breathe. It tells me to stand. Honestly. Sometimes it gets me up and I take a moment. I breathe.”</em></p>
<p>Other family carers thought of ways to modify existing technology to make it support their goals. They imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private internet-based chat rooms or interactive apps for information exchange.</li>
<li>A comprehensive, searchable repository of available supports that can yield individually tailored ‘system’ navigation.</li>
<li>Advanced search engines that use artificial intelligence to organize, evaluate, synthesize and summarize large amounts of information available from the internet.</li>
<li>Smart watches that monitor blood pressure or heart rate and proactively offer calming or stress reducing activities and techniques.</li>
<li>Interactive smart phone applications, like Siri, to help carers problem-solve and find solutions to in-the-moment issues like dealing with care receivers’ challenging behaviors.</li>
<li>Networking applications or online portals to connect family carers to mentors, counselors and each other.</li>
<li>Telephone information services to point family carers to services, supports and guidance along their care journeys.</li>
<li>Systems that connect carers, providing opportunities for socialization, recreation and reducing social isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, technology alone is not enough to sustain family care work. According to University of Birmingham social policy professor Paul Burstow, “<a href="https://www.healtheuropa.eu/benefits-technology-enabled-care/87408/">getting the balance right between ‘tech’ and ‘touch’ is vital</a>.” The insights gained from our work are an important first step in achieving this balance by understanding carers’ goals and figuring out how to support them in meaningful ways.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open science should be boosted in 2020 as the number of journals with research data policies increases as a result of collective action by publishers, who are </span></i><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/getting-started/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being encouraged</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopt a </span></i><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new common framework for journal data policies</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PLOS is the first publisher to align the policies of all its journals with this new framework</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable reproducible research we need transparent and accessible research outputs. And, as an enabler of reproducibility, transparency is what we – journals and publishers – can reasonably ask for, or even demand. Asking for transparency can begin not with new or sophisticated technology, but with a relatively low tech solution: policy.  Introducing a policy on research data sharing is a logical first step to raising awareness of an issue and beginning to create change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies have been in place for sharing some specific kinds of research data (such as protein structural data and genetic sequences) for a quarter of a century or more. Since 2014, PLOS has led the way with a </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory data availability policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all our articles, and since 2016 </span><a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.463/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most larger publishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis – have introduced tiered data policy initiatives. Coupled with discipline-specific policy initiatives, such as </span><a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Earth sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this means thousands of journals now have a data policy of some kind.</span></p>
<p><b>Making a statement about data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important tool, used by PLOS and others, for introducing a consistent data policy is a data availability statement in every published article. These statements indicate if, how and where the data supporting claims made in an article are available. Many journal and publisher research data policies still make data sharing and data availability statements optional rather than mandatory, but we welcome this steady progress on open research policies in the scholarly publishing community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since mandating data sharing and data availability statements in 2014, PLOS has published more than 127,000</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">articles with a data availability statement and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than</span></a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study has analysed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring a new section in every article published incurs costs, which at PLOS we see as a worthwhile investment in open research. It </span><a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/614"><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, training and resources for editors, authors, peer reviewers and editorial office staff, so mandating these statements is understandably a consideration for other publishers of thousands of articles per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is growing recognition </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1476871#.XjLptGj7S72"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from funders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, academic societies, editorial groups such as the ICMJE, that data availability statements are a practical, achievable and meaningful improvement to support transparency in research.</span></p>
<p><b>Wider adoption in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth rate of journal research data policies is likely to increase with the launch, in January 2020, of the STM Association’s </span><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STM research data year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has an objective to increase the number of journals with data policies and articles with data availability statements. Progress on policy implementation will be tracked across thousands of journals (STM is a publishing industry association with more than 120 organisational members). This feels like a turning point in open research policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STM Association is recommending the use of a</span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> common policy framework for journal research data policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote consistent approaches to journal research data policies, at its wide variety of members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy framework – </span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last week in a peer-reviewed journal after being </span><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Developing_a_research_data_policy_framework_for_all_journals_and_publishers/8223365/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is an output of an initiative, begun in 2016, </span><a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Research Data Alliance organisation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The framework includes 14 features, or common elements, of journal research data policies – including data citation, data repositories, and data peer review – and reusable policy text for journal editors and publishers to implement on their journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we compared PLOS’ data availability policy to this framework and, as a first step, updated some of the language, such as to give </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-data-management-plans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explicit support for sharing Data Management Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DMPs) – a document increasingly required in funding agency data policies. In doing so, PLOS continues to lead the way, by being the first publisher, to our knowledge, to align its entire journal portfolio with this new framework. As well increasing data sharing, another anticipated benefit of harmonising policy is reducing the burden on researchers and support staff with different or conflicting requirements between journals, and funders. The framework also provides future opportunities to review data policy language to ensure requirements are easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking forward to collaborating with publishers and researchers to continue driving up standards for transparency and openness in research in 2020.</span></p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper "Cliques of Neurons Bound into Cavities Provide a Missing Link between Structure and Function".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function
has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come
closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into
account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information
flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this
approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains
an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically
connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical
sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming
increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.</p>

This results in the formation of 3D cell-clusters which replicate many organ-of-origin characteristics. Current efforts to develop human organoid models will help us understand more about how our organs are formed and function and how to help in cases where diseases occur.</p>

The pancreas is located alongside the stomach and plays a critical role in our digestive system. Three main cell types are found in the pancreas; <strong>1) endocrine cells</strong> which reside in the islets of Langerhans and produce hormones including insulin that control sugar metabolism in our bodies, <strong>2) acinar cells</strong> which produce digestive enzymes and <strong>3) pancreatic ductal cells</strong> that form ducts (highlighted in figure 1) to collect the digestive enzymes and transport them to the small intestine to aid with the breakdown of food.</p>

<p>Malfunction of these cells is associated with a series of pancreatic diseases. Pancreatic cancer can affect any of these cell types and has the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30456-5/fulltext">lowest survival rate in the UK</a> among all cancer types.  Diabetes is the most common disease of the endocrine compartment and affects over <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html">4 million people in the UK</a>.  Other serious diseases, although perhaps less well known, include pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (which affects ductal cells) and pancreatic insufficiency (reduced acinar cell function). Severe cases of pancreatic disease often leave patients with the need for a pancreas or islet cell transplant deriving from deceased organ donors. However, the greatest hurdles to pancreas transplants include a limited number of organ donors and a need for life-time immunosuppression.</p>
<p>We aimed to produce a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of pancreas ductal cells, pancreatic diseases and the development of cell therapy for diabetes. Whilst developing the hPO model we were aware that for a cell therapy to translate into the clinic it must meet certain criteria which include cell expansion in a chemically defined manner that is compatible with Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) with strong evidence that the cells pose no risk of tumour formation.</p>
<p>To generate hPOs, we isolated ductal fragments from small samples of human pancreatic tissue and placed these in an ECM to act as a 3D scaffold. In order for this to be successful we had to develop a culture medium which would include all the signals and growth factors required to support the transition of pancreatic ducts into expandable pancreas organoids (Figure 2). Through a series of optimisations and iterations in which we tested activators and inhibitors of key cell signalling pathways we achieved a chemically defined culture medium that sustains the long-term culture of the pancreas cells. In addition, we developed a protocol to freeze the pancreatic tissue and recover healthy long-term expanding organoids from it. This gives us the ability to bank tissue, share samples and derive organoids at a later date.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11730" style="width: 664px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11730" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-2-300x172.jpg" width="654" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2: Human pancreatic ducts can be cultured in vitro and expanded as pancreatic organoids.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Importantly, genetic analysis showed that even after long-term expansion the hPOs did not show large genetic abnormalities. This is crucial, as accumulation of genetic defects during culturing, can alter cellular behaviours and impact on the results. We also found that upon transplant of these cells into mouse pancreas the hPO cells do not form tumours, indicating their genetic safety both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Finally, we aimed to develop a chemically defined ECM in which to culture hPOs as the commonly used ECMs (Matrigel and BME 2-RGF) are animal-derived and are unsuitable for cell therapies. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.cellendes.com/">Cellendes</a>, a company specialised in hydrogel technology, we could show for the first time the derivation and expansion of hPOs in a fully chemically defined hydrogel.</p>
<p>Our demonstration of the long-term expansion of human pancreas organoids in chemically defined conditions makes this an exciting system for many areas of research (Figure 3). This system can be used as a model of healthy ductal pancreas biology and the development of disease models of the ductal compartment, such as cystic fibrosis. Organoids can also be derived from diseased states and have already been used to model different types of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741401592X?via%3Dihub">pancreatic cancer</a> (PDAC and IPMN).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11731" style="width: 615px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11731" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-3-300x110.jpg" width="605" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3: Human pancreatic organoids have the potential to be used in many areas of research such as investigations into healthy tissue, diseased tissue and regenerative medicine.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Critically, our protocol does not rely on altering the genome or identity of the cells in order to achieve long-term expansion. This, combined with the lack of tumour formation when transplanted into mice, makes hPOs a safe approach for potential cell therapies. Cell therapies offer hope for patients without available curative treatment options. They provide the possibility of treating a disease by extracting cells from the patient or other donors, altering them in the lab to generate working cells and transplanting them into the patient. In theory, this would treat the disease while removing the need for immunosuppression as the cells would be either self-derived or very closely matched to the patient.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the culture system for human cells was funded by an EU programme (LSFM4LIFE) which aims at investigating the potential of hPOs as a clinical cell therapy. Whether hPOs could be the source for a cell therapy transplantation for diabetes remains to be investigated.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/slimming-2728331_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We all have some knowledge about how to lose weight, but this does not often change what we do. Using formal weight loss services can be effective in helping people who want to lose weight. In most parts of the UK, people who want to lose weight can be referred to an evidence-based group or a one-to-one weight loss program.</p>
<p>However, engagement of men in these weight loss programs is low. Men make up 11-25% of people who go to Counterweight, Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs. With a greater prevalence overweight men compared to women in the UK, and rising obesity rates globally, this lack of engagement is concerning.</p>
<p>Our study, published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, sought to understand what influences the engagement of men in weight loss services.</p>
<p><strong><u>Study findings</u></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Through interviews with 18 men with different experiences of weight loss programs (from not taking part to repeated engagers) we identified two key themes: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change</em></strong> and <strong><em>Attitudes towards existing weight loss services</em>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Theme 1: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change:</em></strong>  A medical diagnosis, coupled with instructions and a referral from a healthcare professional, triggered feelings of fear and worry, which motivated men to engage with weight loss programs. Awareness of severe alternative treatments, irreversible damage caused by obesity and impaired mobility were also key motivators:</p>
<p><em>“My weight had gone up to 160kg … and my GP hinted at, well you don’t want to carry on putting on weight because you might have to have a gastric band </em><em>and I said no, we’re not going to go there</em><em>” [Participant 2]</em></p>
<p>Seeing the effects of long-term weight problems on family members often boosted men’s personal motivation and helped them to understand how severe their situation was:</p>
<p><em>“I lost my sister-in-law … for her whole life she had a massive weight problem, and I put it down, you know, at the end it cost her life” [Participant 8]</em></p>
<p>Theme 2:<strong><em> Attitudes towards existing weight loss services:</em></strong>  Although these medical triggers and fears were powerful, men were still often reluctant to join in or stick with weight loss programs. Two sub-themes may explain why:</p>
<p>Subtheme 1: <em><strong>Female-dominated services:</strong></em>  Men often found themselves in the minority, provoking feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly due to the weight loss context:</p>
<p><em>“Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting” [Participant 4]</em></p>
<p>Some men felt that the female-dominated weight loss service threatened their identity and participating or worrying about weight was not perceived as a ‘manly’ thing to do; men also reported a lack of social support from discussing weight with peers:</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s just the stigma that’s attached to it for weight loss for men, they think it’s more of a woman’s thing to lose weight and worry about their weight” [Participant 7]</em></p>
<p>Subtheme 2: <em><strong>Incompatibility of existing services for men:</strong>  </em>Often, available services were not what the men wanted; programs that focused on discussing weight and praising weight loss were seen as intrusive and overbearing. This often led to men not taking part, only partially engaging or dropping out altogether.</p>
<p><em>“All clap each other and that, that doesn’t work for me, because that’s quite embarrassing for me. They have like a slimmer of the week and all that stuff, that doesn’t work for me” [P13, Repeater, Commercial]</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Implications for practice</u></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11727" height="195" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/exercise-300x195.jpg" width="300" />Men in the study discussed strong motivations to lose weight, triggered by fear resulting from a medical diagnosis or complication. The findings highlight the importance of healthcare professionals raising the issue of weight with patients. However, men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, so engaging men in alternative, non-medicalized settings, is also vital.</p>
<p>Findings that existing services are perceived to be female-dominated and misalign with men’s preferences emphasize the importance of providing a variety of service formats (e.g. men-only, mixed groups, one-to-one), which may be more compatible and satisfactory for men.</p>
<p>Understanding motivations and barriers to engaging is key to addressing them and reducing rising rates of obesity, overweight and associated weight-related health problems.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every five or six years, UK academic researchers submit their most impactful research for expert review and evaluation by the four higher education funding bodies in a process known as the </span><b>Research Excellence Framework (REF)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The results of this quality assessment inform funding allocations for the next cycle and can impact university reputations. For 2021, the REF has introduced a new Open Access (OA) policy for research published after 1 April 2016. </span><b>The good news is, </b><b><i>ALL </i></b><b>PLOS journals meet the standards laid out in the new REF guidelines.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four UK HE funding bodies believe that the outputs of publicly funded research should be freely accessible and widely available. Open access research brings benefits to researchers, students, institutions, governments, public bodies, professionals and practitioners, citizen scientists and many others.” </span></p></blockquote>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Open matters</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.plos.org/open-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you maximise the impact or your research by making it available for anyone, anywhere in the world to find, read and reuse. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediate and unrestricted access to the latest research, we can accelerate discovery and create a more equitable system of knowledge that is open to all. That means connecting with interdisciplinary researchers in other fields as well as peers in your community, and providing teachers, students, funders, and policymakers equal access to the latest research findings.</span></p>

But I think it goes deeper than that – we’re all standing on the shoulders of giants and learning from what others have done before us. To deny that knowledge to anyone else would be wrong in many ways, but at the most simple level it would result in more time and money spent on research that has already been done.”</span></p></blockquote>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK REF OA guidelines in a nutshell</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for the UK REF under the new OA policy, research articles must meet three requirements:</span></p>
<form action="http://feeds.plos.org/action_page.php">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Discovery Requirement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Published or deposited in a form that allows anyone with internet access to search electronically within the text</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deposit Requirement: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published in a journal or deposited in a repository under a CC BY-NC-ND or less restrictive licence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Access Requirement: </b>Published Open Access or deposited in a qualifying repository within three months of publication</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsure if your journal or repository qualifies? </span><a href="https://ref.sherpa.ac.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consult the Sherpa REF database</span></a></p>
</form>
<p> </p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fully Open – beyond minimum compliance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tick all the boxes. PLOS articles are CC BY, embargo-free, fully machine readable, and automatically archived in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and other databases-so you can focus on your science and leave the publication details to us. As a fully OA publisher, PLOS also complies with the stricter OA requirements of funders like </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellcome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And with individualised </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can track the impact of your research in real time across HTML views, pdf downloads, citations, and even social media.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit your latest research in preprint form</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each element submitted to the REF is rated on a 5-point scale between 4 (world-leading) and 0 (below standard) on the basis of originality, significance and rigour. Researchers demonstrate their accomplishments by submitting their most creative, impactful and technically demanding works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another exciting development, the 2021 REF will consider publicly posted preprints, even if the final article publication date falls outside the 31st December, 2020 cutoff. When you submit to PLOS, you can choose to have your manuscript </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bioRxiv*, ensuring your work will qualify for the REF regardless of publication date.</span></p>

<p>Social Psychology looks at the nature and causes of individual behavior in social situations. It asks how others’ actions and behaviors shape our actions and behaviors, how our identities are shaped by the beliefs and assumptions of our communities. Fundamentally it looks for scientific answers to the most philosophical questions of self. These seven books about a range of issues within social psychology—identity, gender and sexuality, radicalism, social assumptions and biases—address just a few of the questions about who we are.</p><ol><li><strong><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-strange-case-of-donald-j-trump-9780197507445">Strange Case of Donald J.

An “engram” is the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Futuristic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception" target="_blank"><i>Inception</i></a>-like” experiments in mice have shown that conditioned fear memories (tone-shock or context-shock associations) can be deleted or “inserted” by manipulating a functionally-defined class of neurons known as engram cells.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="441" data-original-width="441" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span><b>A pink engram cell alongside a white nonengram cell</b> (modified from <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full" target="_blank">Josselyn &amp; Tonegawa, 2020</a>). Within the hippocampus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus%20title=" target="_blank">dentate gyrus</a> cells were filled with a tracer to examine cellular anatomy (white). Engram cells active during fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink (because of overlap with the white tracer).</span><br /><br /><br />A primary truism of neuroscience is that memory storage is mediated by structural and synaptic plasticity. If engram cells are dedicated to preserving specific memories, the next question is: how do you define “a memory”? Most rodent studies search for engram cells associated with memories like “this location = bad”. But what about engrams formed after learning a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00654/full" target="_blank">list of words</a>? Memories of <i>Tomato</i>, <i>Attic</i>, <i>Pliers</i>, <i>Motorcycle</i>, etc. are presumably represented by overlapping/distinctive groups of engrams distributed across multiple brain regions. What about complex autobiographical memories, like what you did on your 21st birthday? The full day (and night) of festivities consisted of many different events tied together by their temporal proximity and autobiographical significance. Studies of event perception and segmentation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-051101" target="_blank">Zacks, 2020</a>) are informative in this regard: <br /><blockquote>What is the relationship between event structure in perception and that in memory? There is strong evidence that the segments that are identified during event perception correspond to the representational units in subsequent memory. First, the boundaries themselves are remembered exceptionally well. ... Second, event boundaries tended to occur at points in time when many features were changing, and the participants remembered those points better. </blockquote><br /><b>Life Beyond Engrams</b><br /><br />The development of an appropriate animal model to allow selective manipulation of the whole-brain engram associated with one “birthday event” (but not the others) seems remote. Likewise, the often-involuntary nature of autobiographical memory retrieval (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721410370301" target="_blank">Bernsten, 2010</a>) <span class="st">— in my case, the spontaneous appearance of visual images associated with loss and grief </span><span class="st"><span class="st">— is not illuminated by current engram research.

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">Transitioning away from Matlab</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">In my last article</a>, I talked about how I got a job in industry. I had been programming Python on and off for 10 years when I got my first non-academic job. Having proficiency in a language that people use outside of academia will improve your chances of getting a job in industry. Learning a new language will also grow your abilities as a programmer and will unlock new projects and analyses you might have otherwise been afraid to tackle.</p>



<p>What if you’re in a lab that’s been using Matlab for years and you haven’t had a chance to learn Python? Here’s my guide to transition off of Matlab to Python. There are a few specific links to neuroscience at the end of the article, but it should be useful to anybody approaching Python from a Matlab background.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>Learn Python the hard way</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most popular languages out there – <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">more popular than Matlab by a factor of at least 10</a> – and it’s the language the vast majority people transitioning from Matlab will choose. There’s two basic strategies you can apply here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer learning (aka the easy way). You have things in Matlab you use every day – array operations, plotting, signal processing, etc. You learn to do the same thing in Python, <a href="https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/">perhaps with the aid of a cheatsheet</a>. A lot of the Python data science API (numpy, scipy and matplotlib in particular) are very  similar to Matlab. They were originally built to replicate functionality in Matlab. With this route, you’ll get moderately productive very fast.</li>
<li>Starting from scratch (aka the hard way). Learn the syntax, then do something you couldn’t do in Matlab, for example:
<ul>
<li>Learn algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Make a GUI application (e.g. in PyQT)</li>
<li>Make a game</li>
<li>Make a dynamic website</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My <em>slightly</em> controversial opinion is you’re better off starting from scratch. If you use the transfer learning method you will be less productive than you currently are for a long time. You will feel annoyed at your own incompetence (<em>"why am I doing this to myself? I could do the same thing twice as fast!"</em>). Furthermore, you will have a tendency of doing things <em>the Matlab way</em> (using matrices for everything, index chaining, avoiding for loops) that are error-prone and you shouldn’t be doing in a general purpose programming language.</p>
<p>By starting from scratch you will learn new things you couldn’t do before at all – you will feel like you have new powers. You can write a GUI! You can make dynamic visualizations! You can make games! You can do deep learning! Your day-to-day productivity won’t suffer because you’ll be learning <em>new</em> skills instead of relearning old ones poorly. You’ll end up being more productive in Python than you ever were in Matlab. You’ll write idiomatic code.</p>
<h3>How long will it take to learn Python?</h3>
<p><a href="https://qr.ae/T3Q1WK">500 hours</a>. Ok, that number is made up, but it’s probably not far from the truth. You can learn the syntax in a weekend. You can make your first significant project in a few days. <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">However, proficiency comes with time</a>. Don’t wait until 3 weeks before a technical interview to start learning. I’ve seen candidates do this, it’s not good. You’re better off asking for an interview in Matlab if you don’t have hundreds of hours of Python under your belt. Start today, keep at it every day (1-2 hours a day will suffice) and it will pay off.</p>
<h3>Why is Python so popular anyway?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio">Yoshua Bengio</a>. Again, I’m halfway joking, but one of the biggest reasons people have moved away from Matlab was the adoption of Python for deep learning. It started with Theano, which came out of Bengio’s lab. It built on numpy, scipy, sklearn and jupyter, all of which predated the rise of deep learning. Then came Tensorflow. People at Google were already using Python; Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, was famously employed by Google at one point. Google needed a high-level language to iterate quickly on models; many of the people involved in Theano were involved in Tensorflow. Python made sense.</p>
<p>It could have landed another way. <a href="http://torch.ch/">We might all be using Lua instead if Yann had prevailed over Yoshua</a>! But combine industry pressure, lots of money, the education sector needing a good first language, and open source, and Python is a runaway success now. And it might change in the future. Maybe we’ll all be using Swift in the future. Or Rust. Or Julia (my personal favorite!). For now, Python is the language to learn.</p>
<h3>I don’t even hate Matlab</h3>
<p>I’ve used Matlab extensively. I’ve been deep enough to create my own mex files and using Java. I’ve created GUIs in GUIDE. I have created pretty big codebases and classes. I even coded up my own neural net framework which I never published.</p>
<p>I’m not going to bash Matlab here. You can write good code in Matlab – and many people that have been using Matlab for years end up writing disciplined code. However, I have seen a lot of Matlab code of a certain kind – using matrices for everything (even though Matlab has dataframes and hashmaps!), avoiding for loops (even though it has a great JIT!), using a giant set of globals in GUIDE (there’s a way of writing good GUIDE apps, I’m sure!). It will take a little bit of work to unlearn these old habits if you have them.</p>
<h3>A curriculum</h3>
<p>If you have never seen or touched Python, you can start by learning the syntax and the basic data structures (tuples, dicts, and lists) through online resources.</p>
<p>Some sample websites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">Learn Python</a>. Skip the numpy and pandas tutorials, we’ll get back to that later.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codecademy</a>. Similar.</li>
<li><a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>. A lot of practical exercises in this one. 30$.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.makeartwithpython.com/">Make Art With Python</a>. If you’re interested in games and interactive art this might hold your attention. 30$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these websites will have some sort of live evaluation directly on the website. Pretty soon you’ll need a local install of Python. I recommend installing the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda distribution of Python 3</a>. This includes the <code>conda</code> environment manager, which will allow you to maintain different sets of packages.</p>
<h3>Picking a first project</h3>
<p>At this point, you could consider using Python for a project (no data science stuff yet). The first app I made was a GUI to upload files to a website. A few years later I made an app in PyQT to annotate physiological recordings with notes. You could make a website. Lots of different projects but basically make sure you cover the basics, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions – these will trip you up. Python has pass-by-reference semantics for object types. In Matlab, a function cannot modify its arguments (unless it’s a reference object, but these are pretty uncommon). But in Python you can mess with your arguments:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_append_fun(a)
    a.append('b')

c = ['a']
my_append_fun(c)
print(c)
# Prints ['a', 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>It’s not good practice to do this, but you might do it accidentally and you will be very confused.</p>
<ul>
<li>modules – in Matlab, one file = one function (unless it’s an internal function private to that file). In Python you can have multiple functions and classes inside a file. Each file defines a module that can be imported. Then there are other people’s modules! pip! Understanding how and when a certain module or function is accessible is one of the subtle things about Python.</li>
<li>tuples, dicts and lists. A simple write-only type for fixed-length groups; a super-powerful hashmap type; and a variable-length vector. It will take you a while to understand the trade-offs for each of these types. Your assumptions will be wrong! You might think appending to a list in a for loop is super slow because appending to a vector is super slow in Matlab. Wrong! It’s actually super fast.</li>
<li>classes. Classes are behaviour + data. Maybe you’ve been doing OOP in Matlab. If not, it’s time to pick it up!</li>
<li>strings and file IO. Format strings, <code>with</code> statements, StringIO, regex – all workaday things in a general purpose programming language that you might never have touched in Matlab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data structures and algorithms</h3>
<p>Consider learning about data structures and algorithms. Many professional programmers are self-taught and never really learn about these fundamentals. They learn intuitively what is slow and fast, and can code many non-trivial algorithms. They might even use complexity analysis (O notation).</p>
<p>Once you learn data structures, your world will open up. This is especially true for people with a Matlab background because the language tends to force you to use the same structure over and over again (the matrix). You might not know what to do with tuples, dicts, lists and objects. You need some solid foundations to transition out of the weird programming model Matlab imposes.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms and data structures classes on Coursera by Tim Roughgarden</a>. These are the same classes you’d get in CS at Stanford, and they are very good. Really tough. You will feel like your mind is melting – in a good way.</p>
<p>You might try a daily challenge, like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a>. There’s <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> if you’re more math-inclined.</p>
<h3>The data science ecosystem</h3>
<p>It’s finally time learn the data science pipeline. Because you will have learned basic Python well, and the tools are very similar to Matlab, your transition will be very smooth. Here’s one tutorial that guides you through the <a href="https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/">Python data science ecosystem</a>. This means getting familiarized with:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
<li>jupyter for dynamic notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest package to learn for many people coming from a Matlab background is <code>pandas</code>. Why would anyone want to use pandas? <em>Can’t I just use a matrix?</em></p>
<p>How many times has your PhD advisor told you to label your axes in your plots? A thousand times? Labeling axes is important to understand what the data means. When you index into an unlabelled matrix, say <code>df(:, 7)</code>, you’re giving yourself the possibility of forgetting what the data means. Wouldn’t it be better to use <code>df.reaction_time_ms</code>? Yes!</p>
<p>You might even have learned how to do reductions, querying and aggregations on raw matrix. This code might give you the mean reaction time for participant 10:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">mean(df(df(:, 1)==10, 7))
</code></pre>
<p>That’s bad! What if you add a column in your CSV? Then column 7 becomes column 8, your stats are wrong and you’ll lose months tracking down the issue. This code is super error-prone and makes kittens cry. I’m not saying it’s impossible to do this the right way in Matlab – I’m just saying that’s often how people do it. Compare the pandas way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df.query('participant_id == 10').reaction_time_ms.mean()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html">Take the time to read the pandas tutorial in full</a>. You might want to pick up a book as well after a little while, for instance <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/">Python for Data Science</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, you’ll need to practice your new skills. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Join a Kaggle competition</a>, or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">follow a data science MOOC</a>.</p>
<h3>Specialized tools for neuroscience</h3>
<p>At this point you might be productive enough to use Python on a daily basis. Congratulations! It’s a good time to learn about Python neuroscience tools:</p>

<h3>Transition existing pipelines to Matlab</h3>
<p>It will be hard to transition pipelines developed over years wholesale out of Matlab and into Python. You’ll want to freeze data obtained after running a pipeline into a file format that you can transport from Matlab to Python. <a href="https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Reading_mat_files.html">Matlab’s .mat file format is readable in Python</a>. Since v7.3 .mat files are in the hdf5 file format, for which Python has excellent support.</p>
<p>In the future, you might find that you need Matlab for very little, and only one or two recalcitrant pipelines will need to be maintained. <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">You could wrap these pipelines in a docker image</a>, so they keep working for years to come, despite changes in OS and Matlab versions.</p>
<h3>Becoming proficient</h3>
<p>You might start developing significant codebases. Will you be putting everything in Dropbox? No, you’ll be using <code>git</code>! You’ll need to know the command line. <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html">Follow the software carpentry class</a> and learn about the Unix terminal and source control.</p>
<p>To really step up your game, contribute to an open-source project. If you’re unsure where to start, <a href="https://www.brainhack.org/">join a Brainhack event</a> – people will ask for volunteers for their projects and they’ll guide you through the process of making a submission. Friendships will be created! Collaborations hatched! Bagels will be had!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll feel the need for speed at this point. Tear through billion row datasets with <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">Spark</a> or <a href="https://dask.org/">dask</a>. JIT your for loops or compile them down to C with <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>, <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a>. <a href="https://rlouf.github.io/post/jax-random-walk-metropolis/">Monte Carlo simulations with a thousand parallel chains</a>? Not a problem!</p>
<h3>Make it social</h3>
<p>People don’t realize how social programming is. As a software engineer at Google, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned about the core tooling in seminars with other engineers</li>
<li>Had people review my code</li>
<li>Reviewed other people’s code</li>
<li>Pair programmed</li>
<li>Shared analyses with other people who critiqued the analysis (both the content and the method)</li>
<li>Went to retreats to learn new tools</li>
<li>Organized a reading group</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned more from these experiences than from much of the book reading and solitary programming I’ve done. You don’t have to make your learning journey an isolating one. When you do Kaggle, join a team. Go to local meetups – in Montreal for instance, there’s <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pitonneux/">Les Pitonneux</a>, who meet up almost daily. Many groups focus on supporting underrepresented groups in computer science, for example <a href="https://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>.</p>
<p>There are hackerspaces where you might find people in the same situation. You can go to tutorial sessions at conferences. Make friends and create a social support system to help you on your journey.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve had to relearn programming many times over the years. Toolbook, QBasic, VB, Delphi, Actionscript, Perl, PHP – I’ve written significant chunks of code in each of these languages. They’re all either dead or on their way out. Having seen the trajectory of these languages, it feels to me like Matlab is on its way out as well. This doesn’t mean it won’t be used at all – after all, PHP is 10 times less popular today than at its peak, but it still runs Facebook! But it does mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be more people who know Matlab than people who are hiring people who know Matlab. It won’t do you any favors on your CV.</li>
<li>Professionals software engineers have already switched away from Matlab. You will have a lot of trouble hiring professional programmers to create Matlab-based infrastructure in your future lab if you choose to stay in academia.</li>
<li>The Mathworks is a single-source vendor, and their software is closed-source. What happens if they run out of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to move away from Matlab. Take the first step today!</p>

<p>Dans les billets précédents (<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">1</a> et <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/">2</a>), j’ai exposé le contexte idéologique des réformes structurelles de la recherche qui sont en cours. J’ai tenté de montrer qu’il s’agit de théories bureaucratiques dont l’argumentation est essentiellement obscurantiste, c’est-à-dire que non seulement une série de poncifs (il vaut mieux financer les excellents que les mauvais) et d’analogies douteuses (les vertus supposées du « darwinisme ») tiennent lieu d’argumentation, mais en outre les éléments empiriques contradictoires sont tout simplement ignorés.</p>
<p>Face à ce type de critique, une réaction courante est : mais alors, vous refusez d’être évalués ? On convoque alors l’image du savant dans sa tour d’ivoire, ou pire, celle du fonctionnaire fainéant. En effet, un point central des réformes managériales en cours est la notion d’évaluation : il faudrait développer une « culture de l’évaluation », avec des « indicateurs de performance ». Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? Pour répondre à cette question, encore faut-il préciser ce que l’on entend par « évaluer » et quels sont précisément les sujets et objets de ce verbe (qui évalue, et qu’est-ce qui est évalué).</p>
<p>Pour cela, il me semble utile de faire une petite digression philosophique pour comprendre la nature de l’activité scientifique qu’il s’agit d’évaluer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Digression philosophique</em></p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que la science ? Vaste question philosophique qui a été abordée par de nombreux angles et que je me propose de résumer en quelques paragraphes. Je me contenterai pour le sujet de ce billet d’une description assez grossière : la science, en tant qu’activité sociale, est la poursuite de la vérité. Description néanmoins un peu plus subtile qu’elle en a l’air : il s’agit bien de tendre vers un idéal de vérité sur le monde, mais c’est un idéal, c’est-à-dire quelque chose que l’on poursuit sans jamais vraiment atteindre.</p>
<p>Comment la science est-elle produite ? Une position philosophique historiquement importante, qui date du 19<sup>e</sup> siècle et début du 20<sup>e</sup>, est le positivisme : la science consiste à observer des faits élémentaires, puis à en déduire logiquement des lois de la nature. Il y a donc une méthode que l’on peut suivre pour produire des vérités scientifiques avec certitude. C’est en quelque sorte un modèle industriel de la science, et ce n’est sans doute pas un hasard si cette position est apparue au 19<sup>e</sup> siècle. De ce point de vue découle la conception naïve de la revue par les pairs comme certification des connaissances produites ou des méthodes employées. Point crucial, selon ce modèle de la science, il est trivial de distinguer la bonne science de la mauvaise science : la bonne science est tout simplement celle qui suit correctement la méthode scientifique (d’où le rôle présumé des journaux comme « gate-keepers » ; voir mon <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/revues-predatrices-quel-est-le-probleme/">texte sur ce sujet</a>). Dans ce modèle, on peut donc appliquer des méthodes industrielles de gestion, de « management » dirait-on aujourd’hui, parce qu’il existe des mesures objectives (externes) de qualité. Là est la justification de l’usage de la bibliométrie comme outil d’évaluation.</p>
<p>Or, si cette position reste populaire, en particulier chez les non chercheurs (mais pas seulement), elle a été essentiellement démolie par les travaux en philosophie et histoire des sciences au cours du siècle dernier. Le plus connu est sans doute Karl Popper, qui sous un angle logique a établi que l’on ne peut pas établir en science des vérités mais uniquement des faussetés - simplement parce qu’une proposition s’applique à une infinité de cas que l’on ne peut tous vérifier. Il s’agit alors de tester des théories, et non de déduire des vérités scientifiques. D’autres travaux, moins connus des scientifiques mais néanmoins très importants, ont montré que la difficulté est plus profonde que cela. Quine a montré que la notion même de fait élémentaire est une erreur conceptuelle. C’est une forme de réductionnisme de la connaissance (je reformule), l’idée que la connaissance est un ensemble de faits et lois indépendants les uns des autres. Or c’est impossible, car pour énoncer un fait il faut utiliser des concepts, c’est-à-dire des théories. Par conséquent, il n’y a pas de fait élémentaire mais plutôt un système (plus ou moins) cohérent de connaissances. Kuhn a montré historiquement que co-existent généralement des théories scientifiques contradictoires portant sur les mêmes observations, ou encore que différentes théories (ou écoles de pensée) considèrent comme pertinents des corpus d’observations différents. Lakatos (élève de Popper) a montré qu’une théorie scientifique est non seulement une théorie qui en principe doit être falsifiable, mais également qui en pratique est falsifiée, et que cette caractéristique n’est pas forcément dysfonctionnelle. C’est-à-dire qu’il arrive couramment que des observations inattendues semblent contredire la théorie dominante, mais pour autant la théorie n’est pas forcément remise en cause. A la place, l’observation est interprétée en postulant une hypothèse auxiliaire. C’est le cas presque systématiquement aujourd’hui dans de nombreuses branches de la physique parce que l’on considère les théories physiques bien établies. Par exemple : la trajectoire de telle planète dévie des prédictions des lois de Newton (ou Einstein), conclusion : il doit y avoir un satellite autour de cette planète (et non : les lois de Newton sont fausses).</p>
<p>Je pourrais citer de nombreuses autres contributions importantes. Pour le sujet qui nous occupe, le point important est qu’il n’existe pas de méthode scientifique que l’on pourrait appliquer pour produire des vérités scientifiques. Cela ne veut pas dire que la science est arbitraire, au contraire. Cela veut dire que la réflexion sur la méthodologie et plus globalement l’épistémologie font elles-mêmes partie intégrale de l’activité scientifique : il n’y a pas de norme objective externe à la communauté scientifique. Cela signifie que la science progresse non par la production et la certification des savoirs, mais par le débat scientifique. Ce point est crucial, car il fonde la justification fondamentale de la nécessaire autonomie scientifique. Il ne peut y avoir d’évaluation de la production scientifique selon des normes externes (notamment bibliométriques), tout simplement parce que ces normes n’existent pas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Evaluer la recherche</em></p>
<p>Revenons donc à notre question : faut-il évaluer la recherche ?</p>
<p>Premièrement, commençons par la motivation de cette question. La motivation, c’est que l’argent public doit être bien utilisé, c’est-à-dire dans l’intérêt de la société. Cela implique sans doute que les politiques publiques doivent être évaluées, c’est-à-dire que lorsque l’on modifie la structure du système de recherche par des réformes, l’impact global de ces réformes devrait être analysé. Or c’est précisément le type d’évaluation utile qui n’est pas effectué, ou qui est ignoré. Les réformes engagées depuis 15 ans, introduisant des nouveaux modes d’organisation (financement par projets par exemple) n’ont manifestement pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il serait donc logique de revenir sur ces réformes et de les modifier. Or ce n’est pas le cas : au contraire, il s’agirait d’amplifier ces réformes.</p>
<p>Ce qui doit être évalué donc, c’est l’efficacité globale du système de recherche, en relation avec son organisation. Si le système global doit être évalué, est-ce qu’il en découle que les agents individuels de ce système doivent être évalués ? Il y a ici un glissement qui est tout à fait fallacieux. Bien sûr, si l’on veut connaître, disons, la production scientifique totale du pays, on va additionner la production scientifique de chacun des chercheurs. Du point de vue individuel, cette « évaluation » est donc faite dans un but de mesure uniquement ; c’est seulement au niveau du système global que cette mesure sert à influencer l’action publique. Mais quand on dit qu’il faut évaluer les chercheurs, ce dont on parle c’est une évaluation qui a une conséquence individuelle et qui est donc utilisée comme outil de gestion. Par exemple, on donne une prime aux chercheurs qui publient plus, de façon à les inciter à augmenter leur productivité. Il ne s’agit donc ici pas simplement d’évaluer les politiques publiques, ce qui semble assez consensuel, mais d’instaurer un mode de gestion bien particulier, à savoir une gestion bureaucratique managériale, reposant sur des indicateurs individuels objectifs.</p>
<p>Or comme je l’ai expliqué plus haut, il n’existe pas d’indicateurs objectifs de la qualité scientifique à un niveau individuel. On peut dire d’un pays qu’il produit plus ou moins d’articles scientifiques, ou mesurer différents indicateurs macroscopiques. Mais aucune bureaucratie ne peut dire ce qui est « vrai » ou « important » en termes de vérité scientifique, puisque c’est justement là le cœur de l’activité des chercheurs. Une conséquence immédiate de cet état de fait est qu’instaurer une gestion par objectifs est nécessairement contre-productif, puisque les agents vont alors être incités à optimiser des choses qui ne sont pas alignées avec la qualité scientifique, chose non mesurable. C’est d’ailleurs un phénomène tellement bien connu qu’il a un nom, la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_de_Goodhart">loi de Goodhart</a>. Par exemple, demander aux chercheurs de produire davantage d’articles a pour résultat que les chercheurs produisent davantage d’articles. Par exemple en saucissonnant les articles, en faisant des articles bâclés, etc. Cela fonctionne pour toute métrique qu’un bureaucrate pourra inventer.</p>
<p>Mais alors, il ne faut pas évaluer ? Premièrement, l’évaluation, comme je l’ai expliqué, est un aspect central et quotidien de l’activité du chercheur, si l’on entend cela comme la discussion critique des productions scientifiques. C’est le métier du chercheur que d’évaluer ses pairs - le mot « évaluer » est sans doute mauvais, du fait qu’il ne s’agit bien sûr pas de mettre cinq étoiles à la loi de la relativité. Simplement, cette évaluation n’est pas un mode de gestion, mais de débat, et ce débat ne peut se faire qu’entre pairs, pas avec une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, l’évaluation des personnes (et non plus des énoncés scientifiques) est naturellement inévitable à au moins un moment de la carrière : le recrutement (et, sans doute, la promotion). Mais encore une fois, cette évaluation ne peut être faite de manière bureaucratique selon des métriques objectives pour les raisons déjà énoncées. Elle ne peut se faire que par des pairs, de manière subjective donc. De quel genre d’évaluation parle-t-on ici ? Le discours managérial parle de « culture du résultat » : il s’agirait d’évaluer la production des individus ; à charge des individus que faire en sorte que cette production soit bonne – d’où une forme de « sélection darwinienne ». D’où un certain nombre d’indicateurs (nombre de publications, prestige des journaux dans lesquels elles apparaissent, etc). Mais d’une part on retombe encore une fois dans l’erreur positiviste (il n’y a pas, surtout sur des résultats récents, de mesure consensuelle de l’« importance » de résultats scientifiques) et d’autre part on commet ce qu’on appelle en psychologie un <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution">biais de substitution</a>, c’est-à-dire que le facteur que l’on cherche à évaluer est complexe et par conséquent on en utilise un autre plus simple (voir une <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/hiring-committees/">série de textes</a> que j’ai écrits il y a quelques années sur les biais cognitifs dans les recrutements académiques). Que cherche-t-on à évaluer lors d’un recrutement de chercheur permanent ? Il s’agit d’estimer si, au cours de sa carrière <em>future</em>, le chercheur produira des connaissances nouvelles et intéressantes. Bien sûr on ne connait pas sa carrière future, on doit donc la deviner. Et qu’est-ce qui détermine la qualité de la production scientifique d’un individu ? Un certain nombre de facteurs, dont certains sont propres à la personne, comme ses compétences et ses qualités (rigueur intellectuelle et intégrité par exemple), et d’autres sont contextuels (collaborateurs, conditions de travail, et bien sûr hasard puisqu’on parle de recherche, donc de choses non connues à l’avance). Ce que l’on doit donc déterminer, dans le contexte d’un recrutement, ce sont les facteurs propres, c’est-à-dire les compétences et qualités scientifiques de l’individu. La production passée est bien sûr corrélée à ces facteurs, mais ce n’est pas ce que l’on cherche à déterminer. Enfin il y a un risque bien connu à substituer un facteur indirect au facteur causal que l’on cherche à évaluer. En plus de l’erreur dans la sélection elle-même, cette substitution induit des changements de comportement des individus visant à optimiser ce facteur non causal, ce qui finit par rendre la sélection arbitraire (loi de Goodhart). Par exemple, un étudiant ira dans un laboratoire connu non parce qu’il pense y apprendre quelque chose, mais parce qu’il a plus de chances d’être co-auteur d’un article dans un journal prestigieux.</p>
<p>L’évaluation, donc, doit être une évaluation des compétences et non des résultats. Naturellement, les compétences ne peuvent être correctement évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents, et non par une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? D’abord, il faut principalement évaluer les politiques publiques de recherche. Celles qui sont instituées depuis 15 ans sont manifestement mauvaises et il faut donc les repenser et non les amplifier. Voilà l’évidence. Ensuite, oui bien sûr, il est nécessaire d’évaluer les chercheurs, au moment du recrutement ou de la promotion, et non comme mode de gestion quotidien. Et ce sont les compétences qui doivent être évaluées et non les « résultats ». Ces compétences, enfin, ne peuvent être évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents et non par des bureaucrates. Voilà en quel sens on peut dire qu’il faut « évaluer la recherche ».</p>

Your editor has asked you to cover the suicide of a young man who lived in the town with his parents. You have been to their house but they would only speak to you through the door. It was clear they were not keen to be interviewed. Your editor is putting pressure on you to meet the copy deadline with something that will engage readers. What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8211-1">Our research study</a> published today in <em>BMC Public Health</em> describes the perspectives of bereaved relatives like those portrayed in this vignette, and provides examples of conflicts between their need for privacy and journalists’ need to do their job. Among the 140 suicide-bereaved relatives or friends who responded to our online survey, many described perceptions of journalists’ intrusive behavior, a failure to consult them appropriately, and inaccuracy in reporting. However, some individuals described the press coverage as an opportunity to raise awareness and prevent further suicides.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11691" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/samaritans-volunteer-image-1-for-jan18-issue-300x184.jpeg" width="300" />Samaritans has published <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">media guidelines on how to safely report on suicide </a>and additional <a href="https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Media_guidelines_-_Working_with_bereaved_families_factsheet_UK_Final.pdf">guidance on working with bereaved families</a>, to protect bereaved relatives from unnecessary distress, as well as protecting the public from the potential harms of irresponsible reporting. This is important because research shows that people bereaved by suicide are at <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2215-0366(14)70224-X">greater risk of suicide</a> themselves, and insensitive reporting can increase their distress. It is also important because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066401/">irresponsible reporting is implicated in inducing further suicides</a>. Supporting the media to report on suicide responsibly is a key feature of <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/preventing-suicide-a-global-imperative">public health policy on suicide prevention</a>.</p>
<p>Public health researchers recognize that journalists find themselves in a difficult position when expected to report on someone’s suicide, whether the deceased was in the public eye or otherwise. On reading our research findings Lorna Fraser, Samaritans’ Media Advice Service lead, commented:</p>
<p>“Reporting suicides can be one of the most challenging issues journalists face, where they must balance reporting a topic which is in the public interest, with avoiding any intrusion into the grief and shock of the bereaved loved ones left behind. It’s vitally important that journalists are aware of media guidelines and follow this best practice advice, due to the many sensitivities and risks surrounding this topic. We regularly hear from bereaved families with concerns about approaches from journalists and a lack of sensitivity with how their loved one’s death was reported. We ask journalists to bear in mind these are people who may be in shock and struggling to come to terms with their devastating loss. They may not even be aware that their relative’s death will be reported in the press. Many will consider this a personal issue and value the space to grieve in private. In addition to our media guidelines, Samaritans provides an advice service to media. Journalists can email us at: <a href="mailto:mediaadvice@samaritans.org">mediaadvice@samaritans.org</a>.”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11692 alignleft" height="135" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/supportaftersuicide-300x135.png" width="300" />Sarah Bates, Executive Lead of the <a href="https://supportaftersuicide.org.uk/">Support after Suicide Partnership</a> added “Suicide is absolutely devastating, and insensitive reporting of suicide can have a hugely damaging impact on both people directly affected by the death being reported, as well as anyone who has had a similar experience in the past, sometimes going back many years. At the same time, the press face real challenges when reporting on suicide in the public interest. There is such a need for responsible, informed, and sensitive reporting, consistent with <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">Samaritans media guidelines</a>. Reporting must put the grieving family, friends, colleagues and professionals at the heart of every journalists’ approach. As Lorna mentions, journalists are often involved very soon after a death is reported, often before support services are able to establish a relationship with a grieving family. Therefore, the journalist may suggest that the family nominate a ‘spokesperson’ who can act as a bridge between the press and those most impacted – and have honest, open, and sensitive communication.  We feel that some of the vital aspects to responsible reporting include not giving too much detail when mentioning method or location, avoiding unnecessary use of images and always making sure that readers are directed towards the support that is available.”</p>
<p><a href="https://mybrotherkilledhimself.wordpress.com/about/">Emma Bird</a>, a journalist and blogger who has experienced suicide bereavement herself, commented:  “I welcome this research. Having lost my brother to suicide, I am now an unquestionably better journalist than I was before he died. I have the qualities that good journalists are supposed to have: I’m a good listener, I’m empathetic and people confide in me. But even so, if I had known back then what I know now, I wouldn’t have made such a hash up of door knocks and inquests. I have no qualms about suicides being reported but this must be done in a way that is sensitive to the bereaved and with an awareness for what they are going through.”</p>
<p>A key message of our research is that if the right approach is taken, journalists can potentially collaborate with bereaved relatives to write a story that both respects the bounds of their privacy and avoids misrepresenting the deceased. Additionally, by providing information on how to contact appropriate local and national sources of support, a news article can encourage people experiencing emotional problems or suicidal thoughts to seek help. In this way, journalism can be used to positive ends, reducing the potential for distress to relatives and enhancing communication of suicide prevention messages.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/left-brain-right-brain-myth/">The creative-right vs analytical-left brain myth: debunked!</a></h4>

<p>I’m a neuroscientist by trade. Popular culture would most likely label me ‘<em>logical, detail-oriented and analytical’ </em>(which I am!)</p>
<p>BUT when I was in high school, I considered applying to art school and pursuing a career as a painter. And I dabble in botanical watercolour and love designing in <a class="broken_link" href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>. You could also label me <em>‘creative, thoughtful and artistic.’</em></p>
<p>No doubt you’ve heard the concept that the left side of the brain is logical and analytical, whereas the right side of the brain is artistic and creative.</p>
<p>Maybe you even landed on this article because you googled the phrase and arrived here? (You’re very welcome!!).</p>
<p>The idea is that personality or cognitive processes (ways of thinking) are cultivated on one side of the brain or other, giving rise to the rather nifty idea that you are right-brained <em>or</em> left-brained, creative <em>or</em> analytical … neuroscientist <em>or</em> artist.</p>
<h2>No evidence from brain scans that people are ‘rig<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-6157 alignleft" height="228" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brain-2062057_1920-300x228.jpg" style="color: #555555; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;" width="300" />ht-brained’ versus ‘left-brained’.</h2>
<p>This popular notion was debunked in 2013 by University of Utah neuroscientists who used brain imaging to show <em>there is NO evidence that people are ‘right-brained’ or ‘left-brained’. </em></p>
<p>A team from the University of Utah scanned the brains of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. They used a technique called resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI)… forget about that mouthful for now. The study tested the idea that one half of a person’s brain is more active, more connected and more synchronised than the other.</p>
<p>The team divided each person’s brain into over 7,000 regions and examined each region to see if it showed stronger activity on the left or the right side of the brain. They also looked for connections between regions that were more localised (also called ‘lateralised’) to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<p>Because, as Jared Nielsen, a PhD student who worked on the study, said</p>
<blockquote><p>…we just don’t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neuroscientist Dr Jeff Anderson, lead author of the study, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right.</p>
<p>But people don’t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network.</p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px;">How did the left-brain vs right-brain myth come about?</span></h2>
<p>The two hemispheres of the brain are <i>slightly</i> different anatomically and microscopically (which means they look a bit different when you look at them with your eyes and down the microscope).</p>
<p>And, the two hemispheres of the brain (connected by the corpus callosum) do perform different jobs. In the industry, we call this lateralisation of brain function. Lateralisation is the tendency for some neural functions or processes to be specialised to one side of the brain or the other</p>
<p>For example, the left side of the brain controls movement on the right side of the body and vice-versa. Speech and language, are typically jobs performed by the left hemisphere. But not <em>ALL</em> aspects of speech are left-sided. Intonation, for example, is found on the right. As an interesting aside…language and ‘handed-ness’ are related. Whereas 97% of right-handed people have their speech centre on the left, only 70% of left-handers do.</p>
<p>Also, studies of patients with tumours or stroke show that our sense of our body and limbs in space (proprioception) is more likely located in the right hemisphere.</p>
<p>Some neuroscientists theorise that these differences and the brain asymmetries of language, spatial perception and handedness probably led to the prevailing myth that personality and styles of thinking are also located to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<h2>But what if <em>I AM</em> a right-brain creative type?</h2>
<p>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has talents, and everyone has weaknesses they need to work on.</p>
<p>Recognise and foster your talents. Set goals and develop new skills.</p>
<p>Just don’t attribute ‘whole brain’, global functions or personality or career choices to one hemisphere of the brain being weaker or stronger than the other. The brain is way more complex (and interesting) than that!</p>
<h2>Is there a problem with using left-brain versus right-brain … just for fun?</h2>
<p>One problem that has arisen from this mythology is the raft of books, tests, apps, workshops and online games that exploit the myth by promising to help you ‘tap into your creative right brain’.</p>
<p>Fine — if you want to spend your money on them and expand on skills and knowledge that you may not already have. BUT this simplistic right-brained vs left-brained view is not grounded in our contemporary understanding of how the brain works.</p>
<p>Also, believing that you are ‘creative but not analytical’, or ‘logical and unintuitive’ and that is hard-wired into your brain, is a rather limiting belief and probably becomes self-fulfilling after a while.</p>
<p>Christian Jarrett who writes for Psychology Today sums my thoughts up perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose the logical left-brain, creative right-brain myth has a seductive simplicity about it. People can ask – which kind of brain have I got? They can buy an app to target their weaker half. They can categorise languages and people as right-brained or left.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to combat that belief system by saying the truth is really more complicated. But it’s worth trying, because it would be a shame if the simplistic myth drowned out the more fascinating story of how our brains really work.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/R0F4q7pU-O0/">PLOS and the University of California announce open access publishing agreement</a></h4>

<p><em>Note: PLOS and the University of California issued the following press release on Wednesday, February 19th at 9:00am PST.</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the University of California (UC) today announced a two-year agreement that will make it easier and more affordable for UC researchers to publish in the nonprofit open access publisher’s suite of journals. By bringing together PLOS, one of the world’s leading native open access publishers, and UC, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all U.S. publishing output, the pilot breaks new ground in the global movement to advance open access publishing and empower more authors to share their research with the world.</p>
<p>“Scientific research is increasingly an international endeavor, often at its best when it crosses conceptual, disciplinary, and technological boundaries,” said Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy and Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology at UC San Francisco, and a member of the PLOS Board of Directors. “Building that global continuum of discovery demands open, efficient, and rapid distribution of information. This agreement shows that key institutional stakeholders — universities and publishers — can work cooperatively to develop sustainable models that serve science, scientists, and trainees.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which the partners are working to implement this spring, the UC Libraries will automatically pay the first $1,000 of the article processing charge (APC) for all UC authors who choose to publish in a PLOS journal. Authors who do not have research funds available can request full funding of the article processing charge from the libraries, ensuring that lack of research funds does not present a barrier for UC authors who wish to publish in PLOS journals.</p>
<p>The pilot will illustrate that an institutional participation model that leverages multiple funding sources, rather than only grant funds, can enable a sustainable and inclusive path to full open access.</p>
<p>“This agreement is the result of open and fully collaborative discussions,” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “Open access publishers and libraries are natural allies, and we’re thrilled our first agreement is with UC, given their reputation for strong action supporting open access in the market. Open access is evolving. We have a duty to meet those changing needs with solutions that ensure the future of open access is accessible for all.”</p>
<p>Most institutional agreements have so far focused on subscription publishers that are transitioning to open access. PLOS and UC believe that institutional agreements of this kind can and should include native open access publishers since they are already aligned with current and emerging OA policies and mandates. This pilot builds upon UC’s commitment to a level playing field that supports all authors and all publishers in alignment with the <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/guidelines-for-evaluating-transformative-open-access-agreements/">university’s guidelines for evaluating transformative agreements</a>.</p>
<p>“UC and PLOS have a long and close relationship as leaders in open access publishing — and this pilot builds on that partnership,” said Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of UC’s California Digital Library and co-chair of the team overseeing UC’s publisher negotiations. “We want to make it easier and more affordable for researchers to choose open access journals like PLOS when deciding where to submit their work for publication. We intend to continue to partner with a variety of publishers so that together we can help lead the transition to full open access.”</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about the paper "Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself, in driving network-
wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of neuronal activity, we study how autaptic
connections affect activity patterns, and evaluate if controllability significantly affects changes in
bursting from autaptic connections. Adding more autaptic connections to excitatory neurons increased
the number of spiking events and the number of network-wide bursts. We observed excitatory synapses
contributed more to bursting behavior than inhibitory synapses. We evaluated if neurons with high
average controllability, predicted to push the network into easily achievable states, affected bursting
behavior differently than neurons with high modal controllability, thought to influence the network
into difficult to reach states. Results show autaptic connections to excitatory neurons with high average
controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding the same number of self-looping connections
to neurons with high modal controllability. The number of autapses required to induce bursting was
lowered by adding autapses to high degree excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic
connections in controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of mammalian
brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic neurophysiological correlates of
structural controllability.</p>

<h2>The three facts about the teenage brain scholars can agree on</h2>
<p><em>1. Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood.</em> Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</p>
<p><em>2. Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’.</em> But boys catch up. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</p>
<p><em>3. Different brain regions mature at different rates.</em> Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</p>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as an experienced decision-maker. The PFC is involved direction attention, judgement calls, emotion regulation, strategy, impulse control, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC thickens as neurons make new connections or synapses. Much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots.</p>
<p>However, during the teens, PFC <em>thinning</em> occurs. Loss or ‘thinning’ of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<div class="column">
<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="page" title="Page 128">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions teens experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowered authors and reviewers to opt-in and reveal the expert assessment that shapes each published article. Combined with </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we also expanded opportunities for reviewer credit in order to increase recognition for this essential contribution to the research process. We also joined the </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pilot along with 12 other journals and launched a </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint commenting trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make early, public peer review feedback available during the assessment process. Both of these pilots we hope will make the review process clearer, faster, and more robust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our volunteer Editorial Boards and Guest Editors worked together across geographies, timezones, and disciplines to launch 30+ </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/s/calls-for-papers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for Papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and of highly focused research. Across all of our journals, we press-released nearly 400 papers, helping ensure that authors reach the widest possible audience, and the communities where their work has the most impact.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>More to come in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re only a few months into the new year and we’ve already started off with the launch of Registered Reports on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which we hope will empower researchers to tell the story of their research in a way that more accurately reflects the process of scientific discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off the progress we made in 2019, we’ll be carefully monitoring these new initiatives with more to report as the programs develop. And we’ll continue looking for new opportunities to break boundaries and change the publication landscape in the ways that matter most to our communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we just want to take a moment to recognize how tremendous this set of accomplishments was for 2019–with equally ambitious plans for 2020. Nothing we’ve done would have been possible without so many researchers dedicating their time and expertise to PLOS and we want to say thank you for your continued support. We couldn’t do it without you!</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">How I got a job in industry</a></h4>

<p>I often get asked how I landed a job in industry after my postdoc. After my PhD at McGill, I started a postdoc at UCLA in July 2014. After about 6 months, like many a postdoc, I started to get worried about my financial security and academic job prospects. So I started exploring jobs outside of academia. Here’s my short guide to getting a job in industry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>Getting a recruiter on the line</h3>
<p>I dusted off my CV and arranged it in a way that I thought would highlight hot marketable trends and skills. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx66dpl39b0hdoz/pro-cv-machinelearningresearcher.pdf?dl=0">You can see what it looked like</a>. I had many versions going around but they were all fairly similar. Looking at the CV now it’s pretty clear that I was keyword stuffing and I could have cut down the content by 30%. UML! Numeric C! Actionscript! Deep learning! Please hire me I know computer things!</p>
<p>Three types of people will look at your CV (and LinkedIn profile):</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruiters. They are the gatekeepers.</li>
<li>Engineers and researchers who will not interview you (for some specialized roles only). They’ll look at the CVs the recruiters send their way and decide whether you’re a fit.</li>
<li>Engineers that are interviewing you and might ask questions about something listed on your CV.</li>
</ul>
<p>People agonize over how their CVs are arranged, but honestly, I think the only thing that matters is 1) the algorithm that ranks you on LinkedIn and puts you in front of recruiters and 2) making the content not aggravating by engineers that will actually have printed your CV. My CV definitely optimized for the first thing although at that time I had no clue.</p>
<p>Why you get calls or not and from whom is completely opaque to me. When you’re often on LinkedIn and update your CV an ML pipeline probably picks it up and marks you as actively looking for a job and gives you a higher ranking in searches. You can also mark yourself as actively looking for a job. I also presume that some recruiters have lists of <em>hot</em> universities where they look for candidates – UCLA is a hotspot for math research – Terrance Tao is there – so I assume, I got contacted by a lot of finance recruiters.</p>
<p>Something else that might have tipped the balance is that I used to do development professionally before grad school, and ran an open-source project. It probably also helped that I’d been working in Python on and off since 2006. I put that in the CV as well. So I was also getting contacted by tech recruiters.</p>
<h3>The thing about recruiters is…</h3>
<p>Recruiters get paid a substantial commission when a candidate gets hired. They have to sift through a sea a people who are just looking, are a poor fit, or who will ultimately bomb the interview. Generally, they tend not to be technical people (although some recruiters are quite technically inclined especially for more specialized roles). You will get a lot of emails about things that are seemingly unrelated to your skills.</p>
<p>If you have a good rapport with a recruiter they can be real buds and advocate for you when finding a job. They will prep you for interviews and give you a lot of guidance you need in these scary times. They’re also generally nice people since they have to deal with people a lot. So, be nice to recruiters.</p>
<h3>The types of jobs out there</h3>
<p>I was getting cold-called about a lot of different jobs with adult-sounding titles and I didn’t quite know what they meant at the time.</p>
<p>They included things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research scientist: the closest thing to postdoc or PI in industry. Develop your own research agenda. Sweet gig. Stressful.</li>
<li>Research engineer: someone who can code research ideas. If working on ML, that might mean being really good with CUDA. Two people you might know who are in research engineer roles: Francois Chollet (Keras) and Soumith Chintala (PyTorch)</li>
<li>Software engineer: in a tech company, a jack-of-all-trades position that can run the gamut from doing kernel stuff to writing JS for a front-end app to doing pipelines on exabyte datasets. Highly respected at tech companies, drives a lot of the research. At a finance company, someone who writes C++, not so highly respected.</li>
<li>Data scientist: in some places, especially big tech companies, a statistician (or, rarely, a washed-up computational neuroscientist). In others, a programmer who works on data pipelines and does a bit of stats and maybe ML. Extremely variable role.</li>
<li>Quant: a data scientist of the statistician variety or maybe ML in a finance firm.</li>
<li>Data engineer: someone who does the piping on exabyte datasets but not the stats.</li>
<li>Business Intelligence: someone who does stuff in Excel.</li>
<li>Consultant: I’ve asked people many times what a consultant does and have yet to figure it out. I’m pretty sure it’s someone with an MBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of title inflation in startups. CTO! Senior architect! These titles are only really meaningful when you start to have a medium-sized business (past series A, at least 50 employees), and even then it’s almost entirely made up. It varies tremendously from place to place. On the other hand, at a place like Google, a senior software engineer means a very specific thing – with a level, a comp, years of experience, etc. So unless you’re applying for a big company don’t worry too much about the title – and at a big company they will determine your level anyway, so don’t worry about it either.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other jobs out there for a person with a PhD, like a teacher, science communicator, or dog photographer to the stars – these just happen to be the jobs that I was getting calls about.</p>
<p>One thing you need to be aware of is that even within one company there can be multiple pipelines for hiring, especially for research. If you interview for a general software engineering job at Google you’re unlikely to get matched to Google Brain; Brain has its own posted job offers which generally have research-something-or-other in their title. Candidates will often try to get in through the front door (in tech companies, as a software engineer) and get transferred to a research job within a couple of years. I know a lot of very smart people who went through this route, it is definitely possible, but it’s a gamble. However, if you just want to be considered for a research job you can also make it clear to your recruiter; just know that those jobs are a lot harder to get.</p>
<h3>Prepping for interviews</h3>
<p>Generally, you’ll get a prep call with a recruiter, and then a phone screen. In a phone screen, they’ll ask you technical questions that are sufficiently straightforward that they can be answered in a shared google doc or over the phone. These questions may be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms and data structures (for a software engineering role)</li>
<li>System design (software)</li>
<li>Basic stats (data science)</li>
<li>Basic finance math (finance)</li>
<li>ML (research position)</li>
<li>Are you a good person or someone who will make work miserable? (behavioural questions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your recruiter will help you prep for the phone screen, however, the book everybody recommends is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>. This gives you prep questions about algorithms (highly specific to SWE jobs and tech jobs in general) and about behaviour (good to remember).</p>
<p>People give preparing for technical interviews a bad reputation. It’s a lot like GREs – you can either use it as an opportunity to brush up on your knowledge, and love it, or it can feel like a miserable slog. I personally loved it. Being self-taught in programming, I had never done anything theoretical data structures and algorithms, so I was really happy to go through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms and Data Structures with Tim Roughgarden</a>. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that it was life-changing – a revelation. All of a sudden the range of problems that I could tackle with code blew up.</p>
<p>I also followed an edX curriculum on data science, which I didn’t like as much. I felt like I already knew most of the theoretical things that were taught and the rest wasn’t very useful to me at the time (using Spark). In hindsight, it introduced me to out-of-core computation, pandas and ggplot, so it was actually very useful.</p>
<p>I went to a data science meetup in LA and met somebody (now a friend) who wanted to work on a Kaggle problem together. I learned a lot from that (it’s probably the first time I used sklearn!). We finished in the top 5% so I also had something to put on my CV about my supposed knowledge of machine learning.</p>
<p>I also picked up a book on portfolio theory for finance interviews. Give yourself a solid 4-8 weeks to prep for your interviews, and do a little bit of prep every day, with a sprint on the weekends.</p>
<h3>Styles of interviews</h3>
<p>I mostly dealt with run-of-the-mill whiteboard interviews (standard for tech jobs but also common for finance). Read the coding interview book to figure out how these work. I had other types of interviews/screens as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take home assignments. Common for data science. Don’t be too smart and don’t take longer than you should. If you bomb it’s great practice for the next one.</li>
<li>Timed exams in secret bunker locations. I had a few of these for finance. Nerve-wracking.</li>
<li>Presentations. If about your own research, don’t pander by throwing in buzzwords; just do it like an academic talk. If about their problem (linked to take-home assignment), doing one creative thing is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a friend who got asked a Fermi estimation question! I’ve never gotten one of those, but I really wish I did – they’re super fun.</p>
<h3>Bombing different interviews</h3>
<p>I have a friend who is trying to date better so as guy-who-has-dated (I’m married now) I recommended that she go on a different date every night for a whole week. The idea is you to push yourself out of the scarcity mentality (there’s no one out there for me) and move towards an abundance mentality (there are too many people out there for me! I better be selective!). What I failed to warn her about is that if you do that you will also inevitably have a lot of failed awkward dates, which is part of the often arbitrary, fickle process of dating.</p>
<p>I had a lot of failed, awkward interviews. I flew to London for a two-day interview with a finance company (one of their researchers had been a PhD student with David Mackay! I love London!). I did ok on the technical questions but completely bombed my interview once I inquired about their policy for publishing research (most finance places don’t allow you to publish, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6114424">with some notable exceptions</a>).</p>
<p>I had an interview in Chicago with another finance company (I stayed in the fancy Trump Hotel! I wore a suit and tie! Pre-2016 was different!). I did ok on the technical and they just had one more interview loop – a 4-hour behavioural interview with a psychologist in a hotel next to LAX! I started crying around the one-hour mark when he started asking about my relationship with my dad (he passed away in 2008 and I never really got over it). I never really recovered after that. But then I got a free therapy session out of it so there’s that.</p>
<p>There was an interview with a secretive Bay Area ML stealth-mode startup, where I showed some monkey physiology research to a confused crowd during lunchtime. I can still remember the smell of the lemon salmon in that room.</p>
<p>There was that one time I brushed off the CTO of an LA startup when he asked about whether I had cross-validated my results. I was like – would I show results if they weren’t cross-validated? Apparently, a lot of candidates did! There was one time I spent 2 hours out of a three-hour technical test debugging some weird corner issue in pandas that was causing my ipython kernel to crash on their sample dataset.</p>
<p>Every interview you will become a little bit better and a little stronger. Pace yourself.</p>
<h3>Showing your best self</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be a jerk – sometimes people ask seemingly dumb questions because a lot of people in their applicant pool can’t answer these questions. If you answer as though a question is beneath you, that’s a huge red flag.</li>
<li>Keep talking and you’ll be fine. The number one mistake people do in whiteboard interviews is they freeze when they don’t know the answer. One thing that saved me in one interview is starting to talk about an almost completely unrelated problem where I found that you could solve it in O(sqrt(N)) memory because of a scheme I had thought was pretty clever. The interviewer seemed to agree that it was pretty clever and helped me make that scheme work for the problem on the whiteboard.</li>
<li>If it’s because it became clear that a business isn’t a good fit after a phone screen, don’t feel obligated to keep going. Your interviewers will feel relief when they see "interview canceled" and you haven’t wasted their time. Once you realize that exciting startup is really "Uber, but for dogs" (actual phone pitch), you can just say thanks but no thanks.</li>
<li>Don’t be a jerk.Seriously, people won’t want to work with you if you’re a jerk.</li>
<li>Practice makes perfect. One rejection is sad. 10 rejections isn’t. Get back on the horse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the most humiliating part for me is that I was broke and I had to ask for reimbursement after rejections sometimes. I had lost my passport for a couple of months so I had to take the bus from LA to SF for some Bay Area interviews. Imagine my sad sad emails asking for reimbursing 50$ for a bus ticket. I still cringe thinking about it.</p>

The lady picking her eye boogers on the right is now a dear friend. Nooglers!</figure>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>After failing many times I ended up in a software engineer (SWE) interview at Google, kept my composure and said good enough words in approximately the right order. It took about 5 months from "I need a job" to "I have a job offer".</p>
<p>At that point you’ll have to deal with acquiring a work visa if you’re not in your own country. In the US that means getting an H1B which is brutal – these days H1Bs get handed out once a year and they don’t fill all the requests so you might have to wait a couple years in a remote office to actually get to your dream job. It’s no joke! As a Canadian though it’s easy peasy – show up at the border, get visa. The company will pay for your visa.</p>
<p>There’s negotiation over comp but the only way to get better comp in many places is to have a competing offer, and I didn’t know that so I took the offer they gave me. That was 4.5X was I was making as a postdoc so I couldn’t fathom asking for more anyway. Job offer to job start took 3 months because of the visa wait and finishing the last bit of my postdoc.</p>
<h3>Silicon Valley things</h3>
<p>The giant tech companies have vastly different ratings on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/best-tech-companies-2019/">employer ratings sites</a> (i.e. Glassdoor), and this reflects that these places have vastly different cultures that may or may not lead to thriving happy humans. Facebook and Google always make the top 5. You’ll have to scroll down a lot to see Apple, and Amazon and Netflix are nowhere to be seen. A lot of Facebook early employees came from Google and they share a lot of the same don’t-be-a-jerk culture. Apple is secretive and that can make it isolating. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">Amazon is grueling according to the nytimes</a>. Read the reviews before you sign an offer!</p>
<p>For a postdoc it might be easier to go to a giant tech company than a highly specialized startup. I didn’t have a lot of marketable real world skills at this point. I distinctly remember being completely lost during Noogler training when they taught us about their source control and having to ask the guy next to me how to use their command line source control tool. His answer: it’s like the git command line. Next question: how does the git command line work? I had only used the GUI!</p>
<p>Big tech companies will take a chance on someone who’s smart and willing to be trained. Startups generally want someone who is productive on day one (spoiler: I was not productive on day one). Then you learn a bunch of stuff and you get to put <em>giant tech company</em> on your resume. People suddenly reply to your emails. It’s a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>At big tech companies, most jobs get hired into a big pool and they’ll figure out your team later. Yeah! Weird system right? I matched with a team almost entirely at random and ended up in what turned out was the perfect spot – with a bunch of statisticians. I learned a lot of stats!</p>
<p>There’s a lot of internal mobility and it’s in everyone’s interest to land in a place where you can eventually be productive and do something interesting. After about three months at Google it was pretty clear that I was no Jeff Dean but I was a pretty sharp data scientist and I knew a thing or two about visual perception so I ended up doing a mix of both.</p>
<p>Of course once you’ve got that first job, it’s a lot easier to get a job elsewhere, and people recommend switching jobs every 18 to 24 months to maximize your compensation. I was a lot wiser for the second round, and when a recruiter from Facebook contacted me about a data engineer job, I told them I was only interested in the brain-computer interface work that I had read about in an <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/01/12/facebook-job-postings-building-8/">news article</a>. That was a highly specialized gig so I went through a completely different – and much faster – pipeline. It took a couple of weeks from initial call to offer, and I was way less stressed because I had been through the ringer.</p>
<p>So that’s how I did it. AMA.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men’s grief following pregnancy loss and neonatal loss: a systematic review and emerging theoretical model.</span></strong></p>
<p>What do we know about men’s experiences of grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss? And what are the factors/predictors that contribute to men’s grief? <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2677-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Philippa Middleton and co-workers in a paper published</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> set out to answer these two questions by performing a systematic review of the existing literature.</p>
<p>The majority of previous research and subsequent pregnancy/neonatal loss bereavement care guidelines have focused primarily on the experiences and needs of heterosexual mothers. Fewer studies and recommendations relate to men’s experiences of grief and subsequent support needs. Given the potential for detrimental health and well being outcomes among men following pregnancy/neonatal loss, it is essential to further understand how men grieve, and the factors that contribute to worsened or improved outcomes.</p>
<p>The researchers identified 46 relevant studies investigating men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss. By definition, this included the death of a baby at any stage in-utero, or up to 28 days after a live birth. Twenty-one studies investigated grief experiences following miscarriage (definitions which ranged between ≤20–24 weeks’ gestation), 10 following stillbirth, and 15 following a combination of loss types. Nineteen studies were quantitative, 26 qualitative and 1 was a mixed methods study. All studies were conducted in high-income countries, and male participants were heterosexual men who experienced pregnancy loss with a female partner.</p>
<p>The main findings of both quantitative and qualitative studies revealed the highly varied and individual nature of men’s grief. Although men’s grief was less intense compared to women’s in some quantitative studies, qualitative studies identified the significant impact of loss on men. In contrast to stereotypes that men intellectualize or rationalize their grief, studies also found that men do grieve on an emotional level. They may also oscillate between problem-focused coping and emotional expressions of grief, as reflected in the dual-process model of coping. However, men’s experiences also appeared to be consistent with the theory of disenfranchised grief, with a general silence surrounding pregnancy loss contributing to feelings of isolation and worsened grief.</p>
<p>The study also sought to identify predictors of grief. At an individual level there were mixed findings relating to demographic factors, suggesting that these have not been well-explored. Similarly, personality qualities may play a key role in predicting grief, although further research is required to confirm causality. However, in contrast to early assumptions that men only develop an attachment to the developing baby as gestation increases, the results suggested that attachment at any level is an important predictor of grief.</p>
<p>Men’s interactions with others seem to play a pivotal role in how they experience grief. The quality of the couple relationship contributed to either a positive source of support that helped the grief process, or a negative source of added stress which increased the impact of the loss. Grief was eased when friends and family were available to support men and were understanding of their loss. Furthermore, a positive experience with the healthcare system led to both reduced grief and increased support group participation, whereas insensitive treatment led to psychological distress and worsened grief.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing need for healthcare professionals to provide sensitive and empathetic care to both members of a couple. This includes adopting appropriate, jargon-free language, providing explanations relating to the cause of loss when available, and follow-up calls specifically to men in the weeks or months following a loss. Practical information on how best to support their partner, alongside recognizing and managing their own grief, was also desired by men.</p>
<p>Community attitudes concerning the legitimacy of parents’ grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss, along with gendered expectations relating to how men should behave in the face of loss, were also found to be important in shaping men’s experience. A lack of recognition for grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss resulted in disenfranchisement, with men frequently reporting a feeling of being overlooked as grieving fathers. Policies relating to woman-centered care and bereavement leave in the workplace also impacted grief. Where pregnancy was seen as an issue relating exclusively to women, and men consequently felt excluded from the loss experience at the hospital, their grief was worsened. A small number of studies also suggested that men were frequently not afforded adequate workplace leave to manage their grief following a loss. In line with recent investigations which have highlighted similar social and economic consequences of stillbirth, there is potential to re-examine current paternity and bereavement leave policies.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that individual-level supports should consider the above factors to provide tailored and appropriate support options to suit men’s individual needs. For example, individual counselling or support groups may not be appealing to all men. Rather, previous research has recommended creative options including activity-based supports, evidence-based online supports, opportunity for peer contact, or including male support workers in hospitals. The results also imply that beyond individual and interpersonal supports, there is also a need to educate the community about the impact of pregnancy/neonatal loss on men, as well as promoting their strengths to seek and accept, rather than avoid, support. The authors also suggest that strategies are needed to develop male-inclusive healthcare practices, and promote the meaningful engagement of men as equal partners throughout pregnancy and childbirth. In the broader postnatal health context, engagement of fathers has demonstrated improved long-term physical and mental health outcomes for women, men and babies.</p>

<p>In normal development of mammals, a high percentage of blastocysts are lost before or after implantation by spontaneous resorption. Spontaneous resorption is a major problem in assisted reproduction in the human. Embryonic transfer (of two blastocysts) in the human results in a pregnancy rate of 30% and a “baby take home rate” of 21%.</p>
<p>Assessment of the occurrence of spontaneous resorption in early stages of pregnancy is challenging, especially in polytocous species. Resorption is very fast, so that with conventional methods only final haemorrhagic stages are encountered. Therefore, up to now it was impossible to foresee and to pick up spontaneous resorptions, which in the majority of cases occur shortly after implantation.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this problem <a href="https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-019-0201-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drews and co-workers in a paper</a> published in <em><a href="https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Developmental Biology</a></em> aimed to identify the mechanism of spontaneous resorption in normal pregnancies. For this purpose, they analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry 23 spontaneous embryo resorptions between days 7 and 13 of murine development. These were identified in a previous study by reduced growth rate and reduced heart rate in daily scans of pregnant mice with high-resolution ultrasound (US).</p>
<p>For histological description, the researchers grouped the specimens into early and late resorptions. The early resorptions were retrieved for histology at day 8 and the late resorptions between days 9 and 11. In the resorptions collected at days 12 and 13 only the placentae were preserved.</p>
<p>It was found that in the early resorptions detected at day 7, the embryo proper was replaced by maternal hemorrhage and a suppurate focus of maternal neutrophils. In the decidua maternal macrophages transformed to foam cells and formed a second focus of tissue dissolution.</p>
<p>In the late spontaneous embryo resorptions, it was found that the embryo undergoes endogenous apoptosis, which proceeds autonomously without maternal interference. During embryonic apoptosis caspase 3 is expressed and embryonic blood cells developed a macrophage like phenotype. Only when the foetal-maternal border breaks down and the innate maternal immune system comes in contact with apoptotic embryonic tissues, the mother mounts a sterile unspecific inflammation and the apoptotic embryo is aborted into the uterine lumen and rapidly resorbed. Failure of lacunar trophoblast and dissolution of the decidua capsularis in the resorptions were clearly discernible from physiological involution of these structures in the normal littermates at days 10 and 11. Rupture of the embryonic vesicle and abortion were accompanied by maternal hemorrhage and massive invasion of maternal neutrophils. The maternal part of the implantation site dissolves by apoptotic liquefaction and transformation of F4/80 positive macrophages into foam cells.</p>
<p>Studies like the above help us increase our understanding about the mechanisms of spontaneous resorption in normal pregnancies and bring us closer in identifying points of intervention to maximize success rates of normal pregnancies and in vitro fertilization.</p>
<h1 style="background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post-traumatic stress disorder and risk of selected autoimmune diseases among US military personnel.</span></span></strong></h1>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11703 alignleft" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/150917-F-YH552-004-300x211.jpg" width="300" />Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can result from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a serious accident or violent assault. Compared to the general population, military personnel are often exposed to dangerous situations and traumatic events, and therefore are at higher risk for mental disorders.</p>
<p>Individuals with PTSD remain in a perpetual state of hyperarousal and fear. As such, PTSD is associated with endocrine, immune, and neurobiological abnormalities. Posttraumatic stress has been shown to impede functioning of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system. Specifically, lower levels of glucocorticosteroids, elevated proinflammatory factors, altered gene expression, and accelerated aging of immune cells may lead to immune dysfunction that underlies the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, interactions within the neuroendocrine system are bidirectional, meaning that hyperarousal and subsequent increased hormonal activity in the central nervous system can trigger the release of excess levels of stress hormones that further contribute to chronic immune dysregulation and the potential development of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Findings from previous studies indicate that there is an association between PTSD and autoimmune diseases, however, these studies were restricted to veterans after the end of their military service, civilian populations, or to a single gender. Moreover, little is known about the potential role of combat and sexual assault in relation to PTSD and autoimmune disorders. Given the relatively young age at onset for many autoimmune diseases and the high prevalence of PTSD in the military, current military members comprise an important population in which to investigate risk of autoimmune disease in relation to PTSD and better understand the role of specific traumatic events.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-2432-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A study by Rudolph P. Rull and co-workers</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a> prospectively examined the association of PTSD and risk of several relatively common autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study population was 123,761 participants who were serving on active duty when they completed the baseline survey. Data was gathered from the Millennium Cohort Study, a large cohort of US service members. Approximately 71% of the population was male while the baseline prevalence of PTSD was 8% among men and 9% among women. At baseline, both men and women with a history of PTSD were more likely than those without PTSD to be younger, of enlisted rank, in the Army, a current smoker, a heavy or problem drinker, or obese. Those with PTSD were also more likely to have a history of another mental health condition, combat experience, or physical or sexual trauma. Prior combat experience was more common among men, whereas prior physical or sexual trauma was more common among women.</p>
<p>During a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (SD, 3.7 years), 864 participants (55% men, 45% women) were identified with the autoimmune diseases of interest (309 RA, 103 SLE, 151 MS, and 332 IBD). Incidence rates for RA, SLE, and MS were higher for women than for men, whereas rates were similar for IBD. For the composite outcome of any of the selected autoimmune diseases, risk was higher for those with a history of PTSD relative to those with no PTSD in a multivariable model adjusted for demographics and history of another mental health condition. The relative risk for a history of PTSD for each individual autoimmune disease ranged between 1.4 to 2.3 times that of those without a history of PTSD, though estimates were least precise for SLE and MS. Effect estimates stratified by sex did not differ appreciably except for MS and IBD, but estimates were generally imprecise. Further adjustment for BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use did not appreciably change the magnitude of each effect estimate.</p>
<p>To sum up, although estimates for each individual autoimmune disease were generally imprecise, there was an approximately 60% increased risk for the composite outcome of any of the selected autoimmune diseases —RA, SLE, MS, and IBD—for those with a history of PTSD relative to those without a history of PTSD. The magnitude of this association did not materially differ between men and women, though as expected absolute incidence rates were generally higher among women. In addition, findings did not differ according to specific types of prior trauma and healthy behaviors did not appear to influence this association between PTSD and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>The findings from this analysis contribute to an emerging body of evidence that suggests that PTSD may be a risk factor for autoimmune disease. Furthermore, it was observed that the magnitude of this association appears to be similar among those with and without a history of specific traumatic experiences such as combat exposure and physical or sexual trauma. The present study suggests that further research is needed to understand the underlying biological mechanisms which may link PTSD with increased risk of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions, as well as how severity of PTSD may link with increased autoimmune disease risk or severity of illness, and understand whether successful treatment of PTSD may mitigate the risks of these non-neuropsychiatric complications.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“I just keep thinking that I don’t want to rely on people.” a qualitative study of how people living with dementia achieve and maintain independence at home: stakeholder perspectives.</span></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11704" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/dependent-826332_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" />The number of people living with dementia worldwide is set to triple from over 46 million to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia profoundly impacts upon the person living with dementia, their family and carers and wider society. Most people diagnosed with dementia wish to continue living in their own homes as independently as possible, however with progressive functional dependence, this can be difficult.</p>
<p>For people living with dementia, there can be a tension between independence as an expression of autonomy and interdependence enabling people with dementia to remain in their own homes and communities. Qualitative research has explored the ethical dilemmas faced by family carers and professionals in promoting the dignity and autonomy of people living with dementia and deciding how best to adapt the home environment to facilitate independence. However, less is known about how people living with dementia, family carer and professional perspectives differ. This knowledge is important in order to inform the development of psychosocial interventions to enable people with dementia to live well for longer at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1406-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The study by Claudia Cooper and co-workers</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC geriatrics</a></em> is the first qualitative study to explore how people living with dementia, family carers and health and social care professionals understand independence at home for people living with dementia. The researchers conducted an inductive thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 11 people living with dementia, 19 professionals and 22 family carers in England. Participants were recruited in urban, semi-rural and rural areas, were of both genders and of differing ages, ethnicities, nationalities and experiences. Four overlapping themes were identified: Being in a safe familiar environment, enabling not disabling care, maintaining relationships and community connectedness and getting the right support.</p>
<p>Stakeholders agreed that a person-centred approach prioritizing the inherent value of all people with dementia, seeking to uphold rights and promote abilities was important. Professionals often perceived such an approach as being relatively straightforward, while family carers and people living with dementia pointed to a myriad of ethical and practical dilemmas. For family carers these dilemmas often linked to the perceived safety of their relative and the family carer’s sense of personal responsibility. For people with dementia, the act of accepting support was paradoxically both an outward sign of dependence and an enabler of independence. Concepts such as <em>relative interdependence</em>, <em>delegated autonomy</em> and <em>social and spatial independence</em> have previously been applied to understanding independence in older people living in a range of residential settings. These concepts feel especially relevant to the nuanced and complex experiences of people living with dementia and those caring from them and the dynamic nature of interactions and negotiations around independence discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the relational nature of independence at home: the dynamic interaction between the person living with dementia, the family carer and professional support, situated within a resource-limited, wider societal context. Professionals were responding to ‘living well with dementia’ or ‘dementia positive’ agendas, perhaps underestimating the complexity and textured nature of the lived experiences of family carers and people with dementia themselves. Professionals promoted positive risk taking whereas family carers felt they were left holding this risk or persuading relatives to act in a particular way. For people living with dementia the realities of getting into the community and playing an active part were far from straightforward. Psychosocial interventions must accommodate tensions between positive risk-taking and avoiding harm, facilitating autonomy and providing support. They should be adaptive and collaborative, combining self-management with flexible support and consider the emotional burden for family carers of supporting someone to live positively with risk.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential impacts of a novel integrated extracorporeal-CPR workflow using an interventional radiology and immediate whole-body computed tomography system in the emergency department.</span></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11698" style="width: 445px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11698" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Figure-BMC-Cardiovascular-Disorders-300x155.jpg" width="435" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1: The schematic integrated concept of a hybrid emergency room system (HERS) workflow</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can restore blood circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as the cardiopulmonary circuit allows immediate stabilization via effective perfusion and gas exchange. ECPR devices are becoming smaller and cheaper, providing an opportunity to install this rescue therapy in the emergency department (ED). The International Resuscitation Guidelines mentioned ECPR as a potential support to be considered in settings where it can be rapidly implemented, and for selected patients with a suspected etiology of cardiac arrest that is potentially reversible with immediate mechanical cardiorespiratory support. However, there remains insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of ECPR for patients with OHCA.</p>
<p>A novel integrated trauma workflow concept that utilizes a sliding computed tomography (CT) scanner and interventional radiology (IR) system, named a hybrid emergency room system (HERS), allowing emergency therapeutic interventions and CT examination without relocating trauma patients, has recently evolved in Japan. HERS can drastically shorten the ECPR implementation time and more quickly facilitates definitive interventions than the conventional advanced cardiovascular life support workflow.<a href="https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-020-01332-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> In this paper</a> published in <a href="https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em></a>, Satoshi Fujimi and co-workers discuss a novel workflow concept using HERS on ECPR for patients with OHCA that can drastically shorten the ECPR implementation delay and more quickly facilitate definitive interventions than the conventional workflow, without relocating the patients.</p>
<p>The authors previously demonstrated that the HERS is associated with a decreased mortality in patients with severe blunt trauma compared to that with conventional trauma management, even after accounting for potential confounders. Patients treated with the HERS had shorter time intervals from ER arrival to CT examination and emergency surgery compared to those for conventional management. These beneficial observations contributed to the rapid spread of the HERS concept; as of September 2019, eleven tertiary emergency hospitals in Japan and one trauma center in Korea have installed a HERS. This system could be well adapted to ECPR, providing an expedient initiation of mechanical cardiopulmonary support for patients with non-traumatic OHCA. Immediate high-quality CPR, providing effective oxygenation to the vital organs until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, is crucial for optimal outcomes. However, there is no consensus regarding the CPR time interval before ECPR implementation.</p>
<p>Yannopoulos and colleagues previously evaluated a novel protocol with early transport to a cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) for ECPR and revascularization in OHCA patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia. In patients who received the early transport protocol, the average time from the 911 call to CCL arrival was 58 ± 17 min, 28/62 (45%) patients survived to hospital discharge, and 26 (42%) had functionally favorable outcomes. In contrast, only 26/170 (15.3%) patients in a historical routine care group survived to hospital discharge with a favorable outcome. These observations suggest that, in these patients, the early initiation of ECPR to allow for coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would likely be more effective than continuing non-invasive conventional advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) alone.</p>
<p>The schematic concept of HERS integrated workflow the authors propose is described in Fig. 1. The HERS enables ACLS to be followed seamlessly by ECPR induction and post-ECPR procedures, including CAG and PCI, without any patient transfer. The HERS likely shortens the time from the 911 call to ECPR initiation and improves survival in OHCA, as early transport contributes to improved outcomes. In addition, the HERS enables safe head and body CT examinations during the post-ECPR phase, even in hemodynamically unstable patients, while in-hospital transport with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device implantation can cause considerable harm. Thus, given that an extremely time-conscious algorithm should be adopted in the management of, not only severe trauma but also life-threatening critical illnesses mentioned above, the HERS can provide benefits for cardio-cerebral resuscitation in patients with OHCA or severe medical conditions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/618345666/0/oupblogpsychology/">How dating apps reflect our changing times</a></h4>

<p>As we look forward to explore what’s next in love and sex, it makes sense to examine to the heart. That which lovers have once worn on their sleeve is now being navigated in the palm of our hands. With mobile devices and apps letting us literally explore desires with our fingertips, as social scientists we are in a new frontier in which to examine who we pursue for love, and why. Is this the end of romance, or the beginning of a new way to love and connect to one another?</p><p>With over <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.toptal.com/finance/business-model-consultants/online-dating-industry">1,500 dating apps on the market</a>, many have come to the conclusion that the romance of courtship has been replaced with fantasy and heavily-edited Instagram photos.  Along with driving this increase in dating apps, the millennial generation is also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/well/mind/millennials-love-marriage-sex-relationships-dating.html">delaying marriage</a> and moving away from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/millennials-are-leaving-religion-and-not-coming-back/">conventional religious practices</a>. Because of this, many popular magazines and TV shows suggest that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookup_culture">hook-up culture</a> dominates contemporary pursuits of love. Right-swiping, label free, highly educated, and technologically savvy, today’s young people appear to pursue sex frequently and do so on their own terms. There also appears to be much more equal footing between genders than ever before.</p><p>Anyone can download a dating app and begin swiping left or right within minutes, it does not seem to mean that more people are having sex. In fact, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160802125209.htm">15% of 20 to 24 year olds born in the 90s reported no recent sexual partners compared to 6% of Gen Xers</a> (when they were the same age). This is likely more about our current cultural climate and less of a generational difference.  Recently researchers found out that across all generations, reported frequency of sex appears to be <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/">falling</a> compared to even two years ago. Even the <em>Washington Post </em>recently suggested Americans are having a sexual <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/">dry spell</a>, opaquely insinuating that desire has been replaced with student loan debt and existential peril.</p><p>Economic anxieties aside, we have to wonder: If connecting to one another is easier than ever, why are we more likely than ever to keep our hands to ourselves?</p><p>It may be that the dry spell is not a dry spell at all, but a sexual recalibration. Some scientists suggest that less sex doesn’t reflect relationship satisfaction or <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencealert.com/no-having-more-sex-will-not-make-you-happier-study-reveals">overall happiness</a>. In fact, less sex could mean that people having healthier “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/americans_are_having_less_sex_but_is_that_a_problem">sex diets</a><u>,</u>” partly driven by people’s increased ability to apply selective criteria to potential romantic partners.</p><p>Accelerating this growing desire for romantic discernment may be the advent of new and specialized dating apps. Instead of relying on a friend’s opinion on a potential romantic partner after a few drinks at the bar, you can now enlist your friends through the app <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wingmanapp.com/">Wingman</a> <em>to</em> peruse potential romantic partners for you and select what they think is your best match. This makes us more selective about who we ultimately meet in real life, decreasing the need to go to out and nervously introduce yourself to a potential suitor sitting across the room.</p><p>However, this increased discernment means that <em>some</em> people aren’t having much sex, but other people are having <em>most </em>of the sex, especially heterosexual individuals. A recent study analyzing swipes and likes on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://tinder.com/">Tinder</a> showed that the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/">top 20% of men, in terms of attractiveness, were pursued by the top 78% of women.</a> What this suggests is that the online dating market is heavily unequal in terms of who is most likely to receive attention from the opposite sex. It is not surprising then to see the decline in sex in the overall population is being <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/">led by a particular proportion of young men</a>. Even the dating market experiences its own versions of economic inequality.</p><p>But these statistics aren’t meant to dissuade a longing lover from trying his or her hand at meeting a potential romantic partner. In fact, technology may be providing new tools for connection that have never existed before. A new site called <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">D</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">ating-</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">B</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://botlist.co/collections/@othy/dating-bots">ots</a> allows programmers to upload specially trained bots for the public to use that can be deployed on a number of different dating sites. These bots then chat with potential suitors using dialogue that has been statistically tested to garner the most replies or phone numbers. These bots promise to “take your love life to the next level” while “teaching you how to flirt” and “helping you select the best match.”</p><p>Ultimately, dating apps are developing based on our prurient interests in finding the best possible mate for our current market value in the dating market. Some apps help to give people the best chances for achieving that, while others may make it easier for those with the most desirable qualities to be selected at higher rates than ever before. However, like most markets, in time there will be more parity as new tools emerge for connecting different types of romantic partners.</p><p>What this all means for researchers is that to understand sexual behaviors, we must look at the economy, culture, and technological changes together to understand changes in overall averages of sex rates and habits.

Savio Chan (Northwestern) gives us his thoughts on cell diversity in the external globus pallidus.  He weighs in on how to define cell type, when to stop mining for more diversity, and whether cell type may even be a relevant construct in thinking about a network’s function. 
In an interesting aside, Charlie bears out how Savio’s work delivers the key functional impact of a GPe-striatal connection that was originally left out of the basal ganglia wiring diagram because it appeared not to fit the direct/indirect pathway dichotomy.  The group considers the age-old dilemma of editorializing observations to fit a functional story, landing on the principle, “follow the data!”

<p>This week on Journal Club session Na Helian will talk about the paper "Dynamic Hierarchical Structure for Cloud Computing Job Scheduling Utilizing Artificial Intelligence Technologies".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cloud computing is widely used due to its cost effectiveness and starvation
free execution of processes. There has been substantial research done
in job scheduling algorithm in cloud computing to improve scheduling
performance, but little attention has been paid to structure design for
job scheduling. This paper aims to improve job scheduling makespan (max
processing time for given jobs) in a cloud environment. A dynamic
hierarchical structure, which introduces sub-schedulers between scheduler
and servers, is proposed to dynamically change the connection pattern
between sub-schedulers and servers by using artificial intelligence search
algorithms. Due to its dynamic and flexible nature, this design enables
the system to adaptively accommodate the heterogeneity of jobs and resources
in order to make most use of the resources available. Experimental results
demonstrate that a dynamic hierarchical structure can significantly reduce
the total makespan of the heterogeneous tasks allocated to heterogeneous
resources, compared with a one-layer structure. This reduction is
particularly pronounced when resources are scarce.</p>

<p><em>Note: This post was written by Vitalba Crivello, Policy Analyst, European Science Media Hub.</em></p>
<p>In an era of alternative facts and misinformation, the loss of public trust is not only a challenge for scientists, experts and the media, but also for policymakers and for society as a whole. Scientists often blame the media for incorrect reporting, while the media are critical of scientists’ ability to engage with the public. Citizens may feel confused by news headlines about scientific studies which can sometimes come to different, if not contradictory, conclusions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">European Science-Media Hub (ESMH)</a> was launched in June 2018 to help address these issues. The ESMH, operating under the political responsibility of the European Parliament’s Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA), acts as <strong>a centre for information, networking, education and training in science journalism</strong>. It is a platform promoting knowledge sharing between the European Parliament, the scientific community and the media.</p>
<p>Eighteen intense months have elapsed since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2018/06/28/the-european-science-media-hub-kick-off-event-communicating-science-via-social-media-june-27-2018/">initial meeting</a>, attended by PLOS among other members of the scientific community, European research organisations and journalists.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu">ESMH website</a> was launched a year ago, 29<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-articles/"><strong> journalistic articles</strong></a> have been published, written in collaboration with journalists and scientists on topics including AI, new technologies, disinformation, communication and social sciences. Each article is accompanied by <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/interview/"><strong>interviews with experts</strong></a> (40 to date) and highlights related to <strong>EU-funded projects</strong>. <strong>Articles appear every second Wednesday, alternating with the </strong><a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/press-review/"><strong>ESMH Press Review “Two weeks of science”</strong></a> (22 issues to date) prepared by the ESMH team by tracking trending topics in the media.</p>
<p><strong>ESMH 2019 Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepared a series of <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/videos/"><strong>7 thematic videos</strong></a>, touching upon scientific topics of particular interest, dealt with by STOA during the 8th parliamentary term.</li>
<li>Organised <strong>thematic workshops for journalists</strong>, including ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/02/21/esmh-workshop-tackling-disinformation-and-misinformation-in-science/"><strong>Tackling dis/misinformation in Science</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised a workshop for the general public entitled ‘<a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/2019/04/18/esmh-workshop-virality-and-influencers-in-digital-communication-april-3-2019/"><strong>Virality and influencers in digital communication</strong></a><strong>’</strong></li>
<li>Organised <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/tag/eysmd2019/"><strong>the first edition of the European Youth Science-Media Days (EYSMD) – the ESMH summer school for young journalists “AI and journalism”</strong></a>. This was the first event of its kind, providing the 80 attendees with an overview of existing links between artificial intelligence (AI) and journalism.</li>
<li>More than 350 journalists, science communicators, and representatives of research organisations and EU institutions now regularly receive ESMH updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What’s on the radar for the Hub in 2020?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To strengthen networks, the ESMH is currently working in cooperation with the European Parliament Liaison Offices to organise a series of Science-Media events in some EU Member States, in the framework of the <strong>ESMH project on ‘Engagement of science journalists/communicators in ESMH activities’ </strong>(launched in 2019). The events have the dual purpose of raising awareness about the ESMH platform and exploring the different needs of media stakeholders in order to better adapt the ESMH offer for these communicators.</li>
<li>We are also enlarging our community of science writers via a devoted <a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/esmh-call-for-expression-of-interest/">Call for Expression of Interest</a>.</li>
<li>We are upgrading our media intelligence technology to produce a richer version of the ESMH press review.</li>
<li>In May, we plan a series of website articles focused on the environment, in view of the second edition of the <strong>ESMH summer school, </strong>already under preparation<strong>. </strong>The event, entitled<strong> ‘Digital technologies for environmental sustainability’,</strong> will take place in Strasbourg in coordination with the broader <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/european-youth-event/en/eye2020/home.html">European Youth Event (EYE)</a>.</li>
<li>In June, another event in the pipeline for this summer is the ‘<strong>Science Week at the European Parliament</strong>’, which will be organised by STOA in Brussels and will be co-ordinated with the Directorate-General Research and Innovation of the European Commission, the European Research Council (ERC) and, possibly, the Joint Research Centre. The ESMH plans to replicate the experience of 2019 by organising a thematic workshop for journalists and a pitching session between journalists and researchers.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the ESMH is planning to hold sessions at two major international conferences: the International Journalism Festival (IJF) in Perugia (April 2020) and the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Trieste (July 2020).</li>

<h2>Motherhood changes everything</h2>
<p>Little did I know before I had my boys how completely and utterly being their mother would change EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Having children threw the pieces of my life up in the air. The pieces settled again, but my body, outlook on life, sense of self and emotions have never been quite the same. Not only did I birth two beautiful boys into the world, I birthed a new identity.</p>
<p>Yes, I realise it is the ultimate cliché, but motherhood changes everything. It recalibrates our life course and realigns our lives.</p>
<p>My experience is not unique. Motherhood is one of the most fundamental transformations we go through as women. And for many of us, parenthood brings with it powerful identity changes and conflicting emotions: love, protectiveness, joy, nurturing, exhaustion, confusion, anger and apathy.</p>
<h2>A cocktail of pregnancy hormones prepares your body and brain</h2>
<p>During pregnancy, a cocktail of hormones prepares your body for birth and breastfeeding. You grow an entirely new organ, the placenta, to ensure your baby receives nutrients and to buffer her against stress. Your metabolism resets to store energy for foetal development and lactation. Your breasts grow so you can nurse.</p>
<p>Once your baby arrives, she’s often so irresistible you become consumed by her and spend much of your time caressing, holding, feeding, gazing at her and breathing in her scent. These maternal behaviours, as they’re called, are essential for the survival of your newborn.</p>
<p>The same cocktail profoundly alters the architecture of your expectant brain, in particular, the brain structures underlying social cognition and emotion. These brain changes last, and in both humans and non-human mammals, the differences in the brains and behaviours of mothers and non-mothers are evident throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>So, here’s a new way to think about pregnancy — changes to your <em>body </em>ensure your baby is carried safely to term; and changes to your <em>brain</em> ensure you’re prepared for the social and emotional challenges of motherhood.</p>
<h2>Pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in women’s brains</h2>
<p><a class="broken_link" href="https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/images/Hoekzema_NN2016.pdf">A paper</a> published December 2016 in the prestigious journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> gave us our first detailed insight into how pregnancy changes the structure of women’s brains. Using MRI, a team of Dutch and Spanish researchers lead by <a href="https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/senior-investigator/190-research-fellows/233-elseline-hoekzema">Elseline Hoekzema</a> scanned the brains of twenty-five first-time mothers before and after pregnancy, and compared their brains to twenty women who’d never been pregnant.</p>
<p>Pregnancy was associated with pronounced and long-lasting changes in the structure of women’s brains.</p>
<p>In particular, grey matter volume was lost. The loss wasn’t random, but was from the same cortical regions in every woman, specifically, regions of the cortex related to social cognition, empathy and theory of mind, which is the ability to read the desires and intentions of others from their faces and actions. The hippocampus, a region associated with memory, also lost volume.</p>
<p>The brain changes were long-lasting. Two years after the initial scan, eleven of women who hadn’t fallen pregnant for the second time were invited back and their brains scanned again. In all women, the grey matter shrinkage had endured, except for in the hippocampus, which had recovered volume.</p>
<h2>Is grey matter shrinkage a good thing for a new Mum?</h2>
<p>In some ways, the plastic changes are not dissimilar to those seen in adolescence when pubertal hormones trigger thinning of the grey matter in teenager’s brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Synaptic pruning in adolescence is generally regarded as an essential process of fine-tuning connections into functional networks and is thought to represent a refinement and specialization of brain circuitry, which is critical for healthy cognitive, emotional and social development,” says Hoekzema.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s likely a similar process of maturation and specialisation of the social brain is taking place during pregnancy. Loss of grey matter volume sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more, and reflects ‘functional streamlining’, not degeneration.</p>
<h2>Brain changes are related to empathy and reading the emotions of others</h2>
<p>Because the grey matter changes occurred in regions associated with theory of mind and empathy, Hoekzema and her team ran a series of additional tests, to see if changes were related to real-life skills. Interestingly, data revealed the greater the degree of grey matter plasticity, the greater the strength of the connection and bonding between a mother and her baby.</p>
<p>Usually, MRI and fMRI research examining brain structure shows changes to be very subtle and many thousands of people must be scanned to detect small differences. In this case, the grey matter changes induced by pregnancy were anything but subtle. Notably, a computer program was able to automatically determine whether or not a woman had undergone pregnancy based only on her brain scans!</p>
<h2>So, what is it about pregnancy that sculpts women’s brains?</h2>
<p>Hoekzema and colleagues propose it is</p>
<blockquote><p>“The unequaled surges of sex steroid hormones that a woman is exposed to during her pregnancy”.</p></blockquote>
<p>The endocrine climate of pregnancy may drive grey matter refinement via changes in the number of synapses, glia, dendritic structures, blood vessels or myelination.</p>
<p>The process of becoming a parent for the first time is an intense, all-encompassing experience, so the obvious question to ask is, whether it is pregnancy, the act of caring for a child, or another factor such as sleep deprivation that tinkers with brain structure?</p>
<p>The team tested for the effects of parenting versus pregnancy in a rather ingenious way — they scanned the brains of first-time fathers before and after their wife’s pregnancies. They found no changes in the structure of the men’s brains after they took on dad-duties, which strongly suggested any changes in the women were related to the biological changes of pregnancy rather than the process of parenting.</p>
<h2>Similar brain changes are seen in other mammals</h2>
<p>Female rodents can’t read books to find out what to expect when they’re expecting or how to tame toddlers. Therefore, changes in how new rodent mothers think, feel and behave must be driven entirely by biology.</p>
<p>Behavioural neuroscientists who study the neurobiology of parenting, say,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The maternal brain is both the goal of the endocrine tsunami that accompanies pregnancy, and the culmination of millennia of natural selective processes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The emergence of maternal behaviours and superior cognitive abilities has been neatly mapped on to the ‘maternal circuitry’ in the female rodent brain. Like human mothers, rat mother’s brains are structurally different thanks to the hormones of pregnancy and the enriching experience of caring for their young.</p>
<h2>Does this data mean pregnancy is <em>necessary</em> for parenthood?</h2>
<p>Ummm. No.</p>
<p>It’s important to note this study does not imply fathers nor non-birth mothers lack the ‘parenting brain circuitry’ or a ‘theory of mind’, and it certainly does not let them off the hook from parenting! We don’t need neuroscience to support or deny that fact, anyway. Babies need warm, secure attachment with at least one loving caregiver to organise and regulate healthy brain development.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one very influential biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that benefit the transition into motherhood.</p>
<p>A birth mother is not the only adult capable of being such a caregiver. This data simply shows pregnancy is a very influential bottom-up biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that may benefit the transition into motherhood.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-6146 alignright" height="300" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/woman-wearing-red-hat-and-sunglasses-1729931-258x300.jpg" width="258" /><em>By Dr Kate Gregorevic, Geriatrician, Writer and Founder of <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/">Projet ThreeSixFive</a>. </em></p>
<p>Dementia has now overtaken cancer as the most feared disease for people aged over 65, and with good reason. The cognitive changes and memory impairment can cause significant distress. Since around a third of people aged eighty-five and over have dementia, most people will know someone with this condition.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I’m asked is what dementia actually <em>is.</em> I say that dementia is an umbrella term that means a progressive loss of memory and thinking that leads to a decline in function. This means people losing the ability to do things they used to be able to do well, whether it’s cooking or managing complex spreadsheets.</p>
<p>There are many different diseases that cause dementia, but the most common ones are Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia and these are also the ones that are most responsive to lifestyle change.</p>
<p>These are my top ten tips for reducing the risk of dementia.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Nutrition</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389">Predimed</a> trial was conducted in Spain and recruited thousands of people to look at a <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the-mediterranean-diet/">Mediterranean</a> diet, which was high in vegetables, legumes and fish, with minimal refined carbohydrates. 447 of those people were recruited to an additional study where they had a cognitive assessment, then divided into three groups. One group were on the control low-fat diet, one group had extra olive oil, the other group had extra nuts. For the groups supplemented with olive oil or nuts, there was a slowing in the rate of cognitive decline.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a population based study of 191 women in Sweden, a higher level of fitness in midlife was associated with a much lower risk of dementia. The women were given an exercise test in 1968, then over the years they had detailed cognitive assessments. When the results were analysed, 44 years after the study started, 15% of the least fit women had dementia compared to 0% of the fittest. Of course this is a small study, and exercise won’t get rid of all the risk, but it’s pretty inspiring to hit the gym.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After even one night of poor sleep, our brains are not functioning at the optimal level, so it’s not surprising that poor sleep in the long term is very bad for cognition. While we sleep, our brains perform critical housekeeping tasks, including consolidating memories and getting rid of the day’s garbage. Both short and long sleep duration are predictive of dementia, with sleeping less than 6 hours or more than 8 hours being a risk. These studies are complicated to interpret, because sleep disturbance is frequently an early sign of dementia, so this could be a sign of the disease rather than the cause. There are many <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/10_tips_for_better_sleep/">evidence based lifestyle strategies to improve sleep</a> and personally I’m going to continue to enjoy being well-rested rather than find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Manage stress and mental illness</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Depression and dementia have an interesting relationship. One of the challenges of diagnosing dementia is that many of the early symptoms mimic depression, like apathy and a lack of interest in activities that someone usually enjoys. Depression and anxiety can also impair memory function. While the question of whether depression causes dementia is still to be answered, it is concerning that people with moderate to severe dementia have reduced hippocampal volume, a key brain structure for memory. Chronic stress can also alter cortisol release and may influence inflammation. If you are feeling overwhelmed, or experiencing a low mood, it is a good idea to see your doctor to look at a treatment plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Avoid alcohol and cigarettes</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While 1 or 2 glasses of wine a few days a week is unlikely to do harm, in larger amounts alcohol is very bad for the brain and can cause dementia. Alcohol is freely able to cross the blood brain barrier and can cause damage to brain cells. Similarly, smoking is linked with systemic inflammation and poor blood vessel health, and our brains are highly dependent on blood flow to function properly.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Keep your blood vessels healthy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the brain is an energy-hungry organ that relies on a good blood supply, it makes sense that healthy blood vessels are good for the brain. There are three important and treatable factors that your doctor can check for: diabetes, high blood pressure and high levels of unhealthy fats in the blood. These are all bad for blood vessels and over time can compromise blood supply to the brain. Seeing your GP for regular check-ups can ensure these are picked up early and are treated.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Keep your brain busy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While many people look forward to retirement, for some people this is associated with a decline in cognitive function. Of course, it is also possible people are retiring (or being retired) because there is already a decline, but for many people work is actually very good for their brains. While ‘brain training’ apps have become increasingly popular, there is no convincing evidence they prevent or slow dementia. While practising a brain training app will help you to get better at the brain training app, this won’t necessarily translate to helping with day-to-day function, so it’s important to find activities to challenge yourself and incorporate them into life.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2>Get your hearing checked</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hearing loss increases with age, and poor hearing is a risk factor for dementia. While it is important to protect your hearing by trying to avoid too much exposure to loud noise, it is also important to have a hearing check and to get treatment. While there is still insufficient evidence to prove hearing aids will reduce the risk of dementia, these can improve the quality of life and overcome a barrier to participating in social settings.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2>A sense of purpose</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most interesting studies I’ve come across took a cohort of older adults and tested their cognitive function and asked about whether they felt their life had purpose and meaning. After these people died, the researchers did an autopsy on their brains to look for changes consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. People with <a href="https://www.projectthreesixtwelve.com/blog/the_power_of_purpose/">a higher sense of purpose</a> had a higher level of cognitive function while they were alive, and this sense of purpose was still protective even if they had changes in their brain consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2>Social and emotional connection</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People with fewer social connections are at higher risk of developing dementia. This might be because loneliness, which is a stress state for social animals such as us, can lead to increased cortisol release and inflammation. Social activity is also excellent for adding enjoyment to life, so maintaining connection or making some new friends is a great way to protect your brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are worried about your own memory, or someone you love, it is really important to get it checked out. Sometimes there are reversible causes of cognitive decline, like B12 deficiency, low levels of thyroid hormone or severe depression. If it is the beginning of cognitive decline, it is also helpful to know so you can plan for ways to stay healthy and independent for as long as possible.</p>
<p>One incredibly reassuring fact is that while the number of people with dementia is rising as most people reach very old age, the risk is actually decreasing. This means that you probably have a lower risk of dementia than your parents at the same age. Incorporating these ten strategies, and the risk might be lower yet!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a></h4>

<p>Imagine that you’ve just been appointed the head of operations for a five-star hotel in Manhattan. Your boss calls you in her office on your first day and says: “Our biggest problem is how slow elevators are. Everyone complains about it, and we can’t have that. Speed them up.”</p><p>How would you do it?</p><p>Most people intuitively focus on speeding up the elevators: installing stronger motors, modifying the dispatch algorithm, getting the doors to shut faster, or even installing additional elevators. But there is also a whole set of options that consists of giving the impression that the elevators are faster, for instance by distracting the users with windows or, on the cheaper side, with mirrors, TVs, or newspapers.</p><p>Facing a complex challenge, it’s tempting to pursue whichever option we first identify and start implementing it quickly. But <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-big-idea-before-you-make-that-big-decision">relying on this kind of intuitive thinking, particularly</a><u> </u>in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">unpredictable</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nap.edu/read/13062/chapter/10#122">environments</a><u>, </u>might result in poor outcomes —<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19739881">even when we have a high degree of confidence</a>.</p><p>Instead, we should first identify the range of solutions that are available to us, which is challenging, because we don’t know what we don’t know. It’s like being an explorer a few hundred years ago who would land on an uncharted piece of land having to decide how to explore it. Well, there is a time-tested approach: map it.</p><p>Facing that complex challenge, your first task should be to frame your problem in the form of an overarching question that, once answered, will lay out your proposed plan of action. A good way to frame your problem is to summarize that key question and its context in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/frame-with-a-situation-complication-question-sequence/">a situation- complication-question sequence</a><u>. </u>Once you’ve framed your problem, you should then think of alternative ways—or options—to solve it before deciding which one is on balance the best.</p><p>A question map<em> </em>helps you explore that universe of potential options. Question maps are similar to other knowledge cartography tools, such as mind maps, decision trees, and the issue trees that management consultants use. But question maps are also different from these tools in that they obey their own rules, four rules that actively drive structure into your problem-solving process.</p><ol><li><strong>1. Good question maps answer a single type of question</strong><br />The first rule of good question maps is that they answer a single type of question. Facing a complex problem, we face two types of questions: why and how. A why question is problem centric; it helps you to diagnose your problem, uncovering its root causes and, ultimately, enabling you to summarize your problem in a more insightful key question. In contrast, a how question is solution centric: It enables you to consider all the possible solutions to your problem.One type of question isn’t consistently better than the other. Both are useful and, in general, you want to ask why before you ask how.</li><li><strong> Good question maps go from the question to potential options</strong><br />The second rule of good question maps is just as simple: Start your map at your key question and explore all possible answers—the so-called solution space. This requires you to think in a divergent pattern. Vertically, use your map to uncover the various facets of your question, with each branch addressing a different dimension. Horizontally, use your map to go into more details eventually identifying concrete, tangible answers.So, if your question is how you should make your clients happy with the speed of your elevators, you might start a map with two ideas: “by speeding up the elevators” and “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster.” You can then continue exploring these ideas into further and further details.<p></p><p>You should continue that divergent thinking pattern as long as doing so brings value. This will typically result in a map with dozens of ideas over at least five layers. For a why question, this progression in further depth is equivalent to the five-whys methodology—but don’t limit yourself to just five, if it makes sense to drill deeper, do so. Since it would be intractable to treat each one of these ideas as a separate option, you then converge by summarizing your entire map in a set of two to ten formal options.</p></li><li><strong> Good question maps have a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive structure</strong><br />Next, consider all the possible answers to your question exactly once. That is, give your map branches that are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://powerful-problem-solving.com/be-mece/">mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive</a><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1"></a> (or MECE<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://percolate.com/app/763/posts/post:46365953/content#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2"></a>). Giving your map this structure is a critical element of the process, and in most cases, it isn’t easy to do, as it requires you to think both creatively and critically. So, expect to spend some effort here—and by “expect to spend some effort,” I mean that if you don’t feel some frustration, you’re not doing it well!</li><li><strong>Good question maps are insightful</strong><br />The final rule of good maps is that they should have an insightful structure. That is, the structure should be both logically valid and useful. Concretely, this means finding a way to structure the map that helps bring some new, useful light into your question. This is especially important for the first cut, the top-most node of the map.</li></ol><p>Striving to be insightful also means that you need to keep developing your map until you identify concrete answers. Don’t stay at a philosophical level (e.g., by just writing “by creating the impression that the elevators are faster”) but identify concrete ways to answer your question (“by installing mirrors in the elevators”).</p><p><img height="923" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png" width="1583" /></p><p> </p><p>Question maps only have four rules, and those are simple enough to understand. Following them when solving a complex problem, however, can be, let’s say, challenging. But realize that the complexity isn’t in the map; the complexity is in the problem, all that the map does is expose that complexity so that you can better address it. So, embrace the challenge, and happy mapping!</p><p><em>Feature image by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/8Q6aHbve5hI">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-to-use-maps-to-solve-complex-problems/">How to use maps to solve complex problems</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/617935874/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/617935874/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f02%2fhow-to-use-maps-to-solve-180x105.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/617935874/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></li></ul> </div>

Reporting to the Scholarly Communication Librarian, the Publishing and Open Repository Specialist plays a central role in the UT Libraries' open access and publishing activities. The specialist is responsible for leading, growing, and improving the publishing partners program. As the individual supporting library-hosted journal publishing services, a service that is growing, this individual is responsible for developing, documenting, and implementing policies, procedures, and publishing guidelines. The specialist develops training materials and provides consultations and workshops on best practices for journal editors. This position is responsible for reviewing partners' practices to make sure they are meeting library-established publishing guidelines. This position defines and encourages adoption of interoperability standards for partners, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and increases the visibility of partner journals by creating metadata for indexing services. This position develops and implements assessment efforts to evaluate the journal publishing service and utilizes this data to improve and grow this service in conjunction with all library scholarly communication activities.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk talk about the paper "Hyperbolic geometry of the olfactory space".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the natural environment, the sense of smell, or olfaction, serves to detect
toxins and judge nutritional content by taking advantage of the associations
between compoundsas they are created in biochemical reactions. This suggests
that the nervous system can classify odors based on statistics of their
co-occurrence within natural mixtures rather than from the chemical structures
of the ligands themselves. We show that this statistical perspective makes
it possible to map odors to points in a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic coordinates
have a long but often underappreciated history of relevance to biology. For
example, these coordinates approximate the distance between species computed
along dendrograms and, more generally, between points within hierarchical
tree–like networks. We find that both natural odors and human perceptual
descriptions of smells can be described using a three-dimensional hyperbolic
space. This match in geometries can avoid distortions that would otherwise
arise when mapping odors to perception.</p>
