            <p><em><img alt="Couch Potato Watching TV" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19033" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/thinkstockphotos-496514725.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>The luxury microwave meal was delicious, the house is warm, work’s going OK, but you’re just not feeling very happy. Some positive psychologists believe this is because many of us in rich, Western countries spend too much of our free time on passive activities, like bingeing on Netflix and browsing Twitter, rather than on active, psychologically demanding activities, like cooking, sports or playing music, that allow the opportunity to experience “flow” – that magic juncture where your abilities only just meet the demands of the challenge. A new <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2017.1279209?journalCode=rpos20">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em> examines this dilemma. Do we realise that pursuing more active, challenging activities will make us happier in the long-run? If so, why then do we opt to spend so much more time lazing around engaged in activities that are pleasant in the moment, but unlikely to bring any lasting fulfilment?</p>
<p><span id="more-18870"></span></p>
<p>Across two studies, L. Parker Schiffer and Tomi-Ann Roberts at the Claremont Graduate University and Colorado College, surveyed nearly 300 people (presumably US citizens, average age 33/34 years) via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website about what they thought of dozens of different activities: some passive like listening to music or watching movies, others more active and potentially flow-inducing, such as making art or meditating. Specifically, the participants rated how enjoyable, effortful, and daunting they considered the activities to be, as well as how often they engaged in each of them in a typical week. The participants also identified which activities they considered the most and least conducive to lasting happiness.</p>
<p>There was a clear pattern in the participants’ answers: they identified more effortful activities as being more associated with lasting happiness, yet they said they spent much more time on passive, relaxation-based activities, like watching TV. Looking at their other judgments, the key factor that seemed to deter participants from engaging in more active, flow-inducing activities is that they tended to be seen as particularly daunting and less enjoyable, even while being associated with lasting happiness. The more daunting an activity was deemed to be, the less frequently it was undertaken (by contrast, and to the researchers’ surprise, the perceived effort involved in the activity did not seem to be a deterrent).</p>
<p>Schiffer and Roberts consider this to be a paradox of happiness: we know which kind of activities will bring us lasting happiness, but because we see them as daunting and less enjoyable in the moment, we choose to spend much more of our time doing passive, more immediately pleasant things with our free time. Their advice is to plan ahead “to try to ease the physical transition into flow activities” to make them feel less daunting. For example, they suggest getting your gym clothes and bag ready the night before, and choosing a gym that’s close and convenient; or getting your journal and pen, or easel and paintbrushes, ready in advance.</p>
<p>The other thing they suggest is using mindfulness, meditation or some other “controlled consciousness” technique to help yourself to disregard the initial “transition costs” of a flow activity, such as the early pain of a run, and to focus instead on its pleasurable aspects and the long-term rewards.</p>
<p>“Future research is needed in order to empirically back our proposal that preplanning, prearranging, and, and controlled consciousness may aid overcoming the activation energy and transition costs that stand in the way of our true happiness,” the researchers said.</p>

            <p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/02/01/building-the-haptic-glove/">In the last post</a>, Dr. Marissé Masis and I built a vestibular sensory substitution system to help people with equilibrium problems. Our idea was to measure head tilt via a headpiece; to relay tilt information to a receiver via RF; and to communicate head tilt information on the palm via haptics embedded in a glove. You nudge your head to the right, and you get a jolt on the right side of your palm; tilt your head forward, and you receive a jolt at the front of the palm, near the fingers; etc. This kind of sensory substitution has been shown to radically improve equilibrium in people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD).</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We got the sensors working, as well as the calibration, RF communication, and actuation. But when it came to actually feel the head orientation through the glove, the system fell short. All you felt was a dull vibration whose location was very hard to determine.</p>
<p>We messed around haphazardly to try and improve the system, experimenting with different stimulation protocols, and increasing the strength of vibration. Eventually, we realized that the glove was vibrating sympathetically with the haptic motors, and communicated the vibration all over the palm.</p>
<h1>A faster feedback loop</h1>
<p>We had a hypothesis for why the haptics weren’t working, and we had a couple of ideas about how we might reduce the sympathetic vibrations; but what we really needed was some <em>hard data</em>. Without hard data, it’s easy to make some tweaks and fool yourself into thinking the tweaks are better. <em>With</em> hard data, we can instead iterate assuredly, picking up a 10% improvement in performance here and another 5% there, until we reach a much better design than the original. For the data scientists reading this blog, this should sound very familiar: A/B testing.</p>
<p><span id="more-6285"></span></p>
<p>I had originally intended to evaluate the system end-to-end; try the system on real people with vestibular problems, and measure the improvement as we vary a handful of design parameters. Putting your design in front of people is a great idea, but it requires a lot of resources. We therefore looked for much cheaper experiments we could run on ourselves to test and improve isolated parts of the design. That way, we could iterate faster and cheaper.</p>
<h1>Psychophysics, qu’est-ce que c’est?</h1>
<p>We turned to psychophysics. What is it?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Psychophysics quantitatively investigates the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">Source: wikipedia</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>To make the correct compensatory head movements in response to the physical sensations in the palm, you have to correctly tell which part of the palm is vibrating. Thus, we systematically mapped how difficult it is to tell apart two feedback directions under different conditions.</p>
<p>On a given trial, one motor in the glove is activated for a short period, say, the one on the left; there’s a one second wait, then another motor on the glove is turned on, say, at the front. The subject must determine whether the stimuli are the same or different. For a good haptics device, it should be easy to tell apart two well-separated stimuli.</p>
<p>How do you set it so that people can’t cheat, and always say, “yes, it’s different”? On half the trials, the stimuli were indeed the same. Therefore, to perform optimally, the subject’s responses should be split equally between “same” and “different”.</p>
<h1>Different enclosures</h1>
<p>There were a few factors we wanted to test that we knew they could influence accuracy. First, there was the issue of sympathetic vibrations. ERM motors vibrate along the x and y (axial) directions; therefore, any sort of enclosure that is rigid in the x and y directions should exacerbate sympathetic vibrations.</p>
<p>We therefore designed and 3d printed two enclosures that were designed to better isolate vibrations. First, an enclosure with the coin ERMs rotated on their side, to rotate the vibration from the x/y plane to the z plane:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Secondly, we tested an enclosure with the 4 motors in their natural orientation joined by four spring-like segments to absorb the vibration in the x/y plane:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We secured the enclosures with 4 pieces of double-sided tape underneath the motors, and ran 256 trials in a factorial design. Marissé patiently judged whether the stimuli were the same or different, answers which I duly transcribed in the Arduino serial monitor — the psychophysics took about 3 hours, half of which was cutting the double-sided tape. We analyzed the results in R in about 10 minutes: <code>stat_summary()</code> does quick work of this kind of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/psycho-haptics">Here’s the repo with the experiment code, the csv files, and the analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Because we suspected that the enclosures might have a bit of leftover sympathetic vibration, after running each experiment, we cut the plastic segments joining the motors, and ran the psychophysics protocol again.</p>

<p>Cutting the segments turned out to be quite important for the flat enclosure:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Indeed, we found a large increase in performance (about 6% in absolute terms) after cutting the arms connecting the flat enclosure, which means we had still not fully resolved the issue of sympathetic vibrations. By contrast, for the rotated enclosure, there was no significant change in performance after removing the adjoining arms.</p>
<p>Of all the variants we tried, the best performing one was also the one with the simplest geometry: disconnected motors lying flat within the palm held with adhesive. In the next iteration of our prototype, we’ll stick with the flat configuration; we’ll use very thin connecting segments  between the pads to confer it the minimal amount of structural integrity to be easy to handle.</p>
<h1>Location on the palm</h1>
<p>We then looked at how the direction of the reference stimulus (0 degrees corresponding to the right of the hand, 90 degrees to the top of the hand, etc.) influenced accuracy:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Here, the 45 deg, 135 deg, etc. positions correspond to driving two motors simultaneously at a lower voltage, to simulate an intermediate direction between two motors. These intermediate positions turned out to be a bottleneck in our design; it’s a lot easier to tell apart stimuli when one is located in a cardinal direction. If we extrapolate the performance along cardinal directions with a sine wave, we get a prediction of what the performance might be like with 8 motors instead of 4:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>I estimate that we could get a sizable 6% absolute increase in discrimination with 8 motors instead of 4. Another thing to notice is that out of all the cardinal directions, 0 degrees, on the right side of the left palm, is noticeably less sensitive. By moving this motor a bit to the left, it might be possible to squeeze more performance out of the system.</p>
<h1>Strength of the vibration</h1>
<p>You might recall that I built a boosting circuit on the receiver to increase the strength of the drive to the motors from 3.3V all the way to 5V. Was it worth it?</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>The results unambiguously say <em>no</em>. In fact, the discriminability goes does <em>down</em> slightly as we increase the strength of the vibration. I must admit, when I saw this, I was floored.</p>
<p>The vibration receptors in the palm — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellar_corpuscle">Pacinian corpuscules</a> — are most sensitive to frequencies in the <a href="http://neurobiography.info/teaching.php?lectureid=105&amp;mode=handout">200-300Hz </a>range. Driven at high voltages (5V), ERMs can vibrate at frequencies past this optimum. By bringing the voltage down, ERMs vibrate less, but at frequencies the skin is more sensitive to. <a href="https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/application-notes/ab-029-vibration-motors-voltage-vs-frequency-vs-amplitude">Precision Microdrives</a> has excellent whitepapers on the subject of haptics actuators.</p>
<p>The whole boosting circuit, which took ages to solder, was pretty useless. As Donald Knuth famously quipped, premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
<h1>Single vibrations versus motion vectors</h1>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00221-015-4346-1">There’s some evidence in the literature</a> that it’s easier to tell apart spatiotemporal sequences of vibrations — a sweep from bottom to top vs. a sweep from right to left — than it is to tell apart single vibrations, or taps.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6780" style="width: 1486px;"><img />In the Eagleman paper, spatiotemporal patterns were easier to identity than spatial or single motor patterns.</figure>
<p>We tested this in our setup and found that, in our setup, performance was worse with sweeps than with taps:<br />
<img /></p>
<p>How do we square this with the previous literature? In the Eagleman paper, the vibration motors were very close compared to the size of receptive fields at the stimulation location (lower back). Furthermore, they compared the performance of these sweeps to complex patterns actuated by several motors simultaneously. Given that the motors were so close together that they likely drove the same afferents, it’s not surprising that patterns underperformed compared to sweeps: the separation in the temporal dimension could compensate for the lack of separation in the spatial dimension.</p>
<p>Another potential reason is that our coin-cell ERMs have sluggish temporal responses, which make them ill-suited for communicating fine-grained temporal information. While we have nice, monotonic psychometric functions for the single tap experiments, in the sweep experiments, the performance at 180 degrees is similar to 90 degrees apart:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>That means it’s hard to tell apart an upward sweep from a downward sweep. If a person makes a compensatory movement that is 180 degrees away from the correct direction, they’ll end up in a worse position than they started; performance at 180 degree should be close to 100% for the design to work.</p>
<p>When I tested the impulse response function of these coin ERMs, and found that they really get going after ~50 ms, with some jitter; given that the haptic pulses here are only 100ms, it’s not surprising that the direction of the felt motion could be misestimated because at that jitter.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>We learned a lot from this simple series of experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a flat enclosure can work well as long as it deals with sympathetic vibrations propery</li>
<li>some parts of the palm are more sensitive than others</li>
<li>8 motors should work better than 4 motors</li>
<li>stimulation voltage is a minor parameter; a 3V drive is sufficient</li>
<li>undirected stimulation works better than directed sweeps</li>
</ul>
<p>In our baseline condition — a flat, connected enclosure, directed stimulation, strong vibration — which was most similar to the stimulation within the glove, accuracy was at about 63%. With the various tweaks that we found — as well as the addition of another 4 motors — we expect to increase the accuracy to about 83%. While A/B testing and psychophysics can feel an awful lot like bean counting when you’re doing it, the cumulative effect of small tweaks can lift a design from clunky to polished.</p>
<p>There is one parameter of the design that we didn’t try to tweak: changing the actuator type. <a href="https://blog.somaticlabs.io/how-it-works-linear-resonant-actuators/">Linear resonant actuators (LRAs)</a> are more temporally precise than ERMs, and they vibrate in the z direction rather than in the x-y direction, so they don’t have as many issues of sympathetic vibrations. On the other hand, they require dedicated drivers and are quite a bit more expensive.</p>
<p>For now, we think that simply packing more ERMs in the glove is a more promising direction than switching to LRAs, but we don’t know yet. In the next installment, we’ll pitch an LRA-based prototype against an improved, ERM-based one.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that affects <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16713924">1% of the population over the age of 60</a>. PD is considered to be a movement disorder; the cardinal signs of the disease – tremor, rigidity and Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) – result from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and a loss of voluntary movement. Yet the non-motor symptoms of PD, often under-recognized and under-treated, severely impact the quality of patients’ lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies, protein clumps which are comprised mainly of the aggregated protein α-synuclein, in the brain. The presence of Lewy bodies is used to confirm a PD diagnosis, but this can only be done post-mortem. However, disease pathology is also present in peripheral tissues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One prime site of peripheral pathology in PD seems to be the skin; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862733">patients with PD often present with dermatological symptoms</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089386">α-synuclein deposition in peripheral nerve terminals</a> in the skin has been reported and a higher rate of skin cancer is observed in the PD population. So, could a peripheral biomarker in the skin be used to provide a definitive diagnosis of PD and monitor progression of the disease in patients?</p>

<p>A study <a href="http://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-016-0784-z">recently published</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Neurology</a></em> sort to address this question. The researchers, led by Anu Planken, used whole transcriptomic profiling to investigate whether molecular changes observed in the nervous system in PD are also present in the skin. Skin biopsies from 12 patients with PD and 12 healthy matched controls were analyzed. RNA sequencing revealed 1074 genes that were differentially regulated between control and PD skin samples; most of the altered genes (82%) showed decreased expression in the PD samples.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, using functional pathway analysis, the researchers discovered that the genes altered in patients skin can be grouped into six broad functional categories: impaired cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein metabolism, disturbed skin homeostasis, dysfunctional nuclear processes, altered signaling and tumor pathways, and disordered immune regulation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly, the largest group of genes altered in PD skin are those involved in mitochondrial function and protein metabolism; impairment of both of these biological systems are key in the central nervous system pathophysiology of PD. Changes in genes involved in skin homeostasis may also shed light on the apparent increased incidence of skin cancer in patients with PD.</p>

<p>Thus, this study provides some insights into the molecular changes occurring in the skin during PD, and paves the way for further investigation of a number of potential targets for diagnostic biomarkers.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="http://romainbrette.fr">Romain Brette</a> on February 08, 2017 10:56 AM.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>I am writing a <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-book-on-the-theory-of-action-potentials/">book on the theory of action potentials</a>. As I haven't published any new chapter for about 6 months, I will give a brief update on the progress of the book.</p>
<p>It turns out that writing a book is difficult (!). As I write the book, I get to question some aspects I take for granted and I realize they are actually not that simple. That I have learned a lot about biophysics. In turn, this tends to make the book more complicated, and so it requires some additional digestion work. I also realize that some important questions are just unresolved and require some research work. Finally, it is quite difficult to write a book while continuing the normal course of research. I started with a one hour per day habit, but this may not be optimal; I tend to spend the first half-hour trying to get back to the matter of the book. I am starting a new routine with two mornings twice a week. We will see how it goes!</p>
<p>These last months I have been working on the 4th chapter, on excitability of an isopotential membrane. This will contain in particular some of the material in <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850">Platkiewicz &amp; Brette (2010)</a> on the relation between biophysical parameters and threshold. I wanted to use the same theoretical approach to apply it to other aspects of the action potential (speed, peak etc), so that needed some more work. I realized that some approximations we had done could be enhanced, but the math is slightly more complicated. It is a challenge to keep this chapter simple. I also wanted to apply the theory to the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, but unfortunately it works moderately well. One reason is that the model was fitted to the full action potential and not to initiation (as in fact essentially all empirical neuron models). So in particular, H&amp;H experiments show that the Na+ conductance depends exponentially on voltage at low voltage, but their model doesn't (or approximately does with a different factor). Another reason is the K+ channel has less delay than in the actual squid axon (which they acknowledge), so there is some interaction with the initial Na+ current. So I will go with a simpler approach, using a simplified excitability model. Neurons are not isopotential anyway.</p>
<p>I am also planning to reorganize and partly rewrite chapters 2 and 3. I find the current chapter 3 (action potential of an isopotential membrane) a bit too technical. I also want to change chapter 2 (membrane polarization) to talk about alternative theories of the membrane potential (Tasaki, Ling, etc). Then I want to insert a chapter on the ionic channel theory of action potentials, which explains the theory and discusses empirical evidence, before the chapter on the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Generally, I want to simplify the exposition. But given my rather slow progress on the book so far, I will probably postpone this and first write drafts of the following chapters.</p>
<p>Finally, I have worked a bit on energy consumption and pumps, and I found out that the current treatment in the literature is not entirely satisfactory (see for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598490">my comments on a classical paper</a> on the subject). It turns out that it is a pretty complicated problem (especially systems of pumps).</p>
<p>In brief, I am trying to finish a first version of the chapter on excitability of an isopotential membrane, hopefully within one month.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?juliagottwald">Julia Gottwald</a></p>
<p>Coming up with the perfect recipe for crisps or the ideal marketing strategy for a soft drink used to depend on explicit measures. In focus groups and surveys, consumers were asked which product tasted best or which commercial was most appealing. But these measures are imperfect: consumers may choose to hide their true opinions or they might not be fully aware of their own preferences. Food and drinks companies need more objective measures. Currently their best hope is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p>
<p>The idea is that somewhere in the brain, a “buy button” is hidden away: a region (or combination of regions) that influence your purchase decision. The promise of neuromarketing is that one day, we will be able to find this region, record its activity when you watch an ad or sample a product, and then predict how well this product will sell. So far, the success has been limited. But in a recent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916301410">study</a> in <em>NeuroImage</em>, Simone Kühn from the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf and her colleagues claim to have found “multiple ‘buy buttons’ in the brain”.</p>
<p><span id="more-18846"></span></p>
<p>The researchers showed six different ads for the chocolate bar “Duplo” to 18 healthy women while they underwent fMRI. In these ads, the chocolate bar was presented either next to the face of a woman; a couple; a group of people; in two hands; in two hands and with an additional slogan; or next to a toothbrush (the toothbrush was meant to serve as a control condition).</p>
<p>The researchers measured brain activity during the adverts in eight brain regions thought to be involved in making purchase decisions. Then they entered these measures into a formula that weighed key areas such as the nucleus accumbens and medial orbitofrontal cortex more strongly than others, which were expected to have less influence. Some areas, such as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, were even weighed negatively, assuming that higher activity in these regions would make a purchase less likely. The team then used this “fMRI sales forecast value” to predict the sales of the chocolate bar. After the scan, the women were also asked which ad they liked most.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers ranked the six ads in different ways: according to the fMRI forecast; according to the women’s explicit preferences; and according to actual sales in a real German supermarket where the chocolate bar was sold in a display showing one of the six different ads, with a different advert used each week. In total, more than 63,000 customers were recorded, of whom 317 bought the chocolate bars. The six weeks were not consecutive and were carefully chosen to be uninfluenced by holidays and promotional periods.</p>
<p>The fMRI-based forecast was a surprisingly accurate predictor of sales, while self-reports performed poorly. The two ads which did best in the supermarket (chocolate bar in front of a group and next to a woman) were also predicted to be most successful by the fMRI sales forecast value. In contrast, the two most-liked ads from the self-reports (hands without text and, somewhat surprisingly, the toothbrush) were actually the least and third to least successful ones.</p>
<p>These seem like impressive results for the field of neuromarketing, but I had a number of reservations. For instance, while the authors tried to justify their selection of brain areas, arguing that these regions had previously been implicated in neuromarketing research, it is not entirely clear how they came up with their specific formula to calculate the “fMRI sales forecast value”. A clearer rationale would have been helpful.</p>
<p>The new results also contradict <a href="http://journals.ama.org/doi/10.1509/jmr.13.0593?code=amma-site">earlier studies</a>, which found that asking people directly about their preferences was far superior over modern measures such as fMRI. Note though that in this study, people were asked which ad they <em>liked</em> best. But <em>liking</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2756052/">does not equal</a> <em>wanting</em>. You might not like an ad very much, but it could still increase your desire for a product. A more useful question for the self-report part of this study would have been: “How much does this ad make you want to buy the chocolate?”</p>
<p>Also, there was a potential effect of the order in which the ads were displayed in the shops. The most successful ad, which was also predicted to be most successful by the fMRI based forecast, was the one that was used first in the German supermarket. The authors argue that most customers would have bought and eaten Duplo before, since it is a very popular sweet in Germany. However, it is easy to see how a new display in your local supermarket could encourage you to buy this product, regardless of the ad attached to it. Future studies should take this effect into account and maybe start with a shop display without any ads in the first week.</p>
<p>But perhaps most concerning is that one of the study authors, Enrique Strelow, is only listed in the paper as a member of the Justus-Liebig University of Gießen, even though he is also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-strelow-41826a126">Head of Shopper Communication at Ferrero</a>, the company that makes the chocolate bar Duplo. This is a clear conflict of interest, which was not disclosed in the paper. From reading the article, it is clear that the authors had cooperated with Ferrero, since they had early access to the advertisements which would later be placed in the supermarket. However, one of the authors being an employee of this company is a different thing altogether. Since these conflicts of interests can implicitly or explicitly influence study design, analysis, and result presentation, it is common practice to disclose any links to industry. Why this information was not made publicly available for this paper is unclear.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the study highlights how neuroimaging-based market research in relatively small groups could one day reliably predict product sales on a large scale. Giving companies access to such sensitive data holds the potential for abuse and should therefore be carefully regulated. While there are strict regulations for fMRI based research in academic settings, such rules are lacking for industry applications. A public debate about the merits and dangers of neuromarketing is therefore more and more <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sex-Lies-Brain-Scans-reveals/dp/0198752881">pressing</a>.</p>

 The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system.

            <p>
 Metabolic pathways that contribute to adiposity and ageing are activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) axis. However, known mTORC1–S6K1 targets do not account for observed loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that there are additional downstream effectors of this pathway. Here we identify glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as an mTORC1–S6K1 target that contributes to adiposity and ageing. Phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser999 by mTORC1–S6K1 induces its release from the aminoacyl tRNA multisynthetase complex, which is required for execution of noncanonical functions of EPRS beyond protein synthesis. To investigate the physiological function of EPRS phosphorylation, we generated Eprs knock-in mice bearing phospho-deficient Ser999-to-Ala (S999A) and phospho-mimetic (S999D) mutations. Homozygous S999A mice exhibited low body weight, reduced adipose tissue mass, and increased lifespan, similar to S6K1-deficient mice and mice with adipocyte-specific deficiency of raptor, an mTORC1 constituent. Substitution of the EprsS999D allele in S6K1-deficient mice normalized body mass and adiposity, indicating that EPRS phosphorylation mediates S6K1-dependent metabolic responses. In adipocytes, insulin stimulated S6K1-dependent EPRS phosphorylation and release from the multisynthetase complex. Interaction screening revealed that phospho-EPRS binds SLC27A1 (that is, fatty acid transport protein 1, FATP1), inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane and long-chain fatty acid uptake. Thus, EPRS and FATP1 are terminal mTORC1–S6K1 axis effectors that are critical for metabolic phenotypes.

 Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) is a highly nutritious grain identified as an important crop to improve world food security. Unfortunately, few resources are available to facilitate its genetic improvement. Here we report the assembly of a high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome sequence for quinoa, which was produced using single-molecule real-time sequencing in combination with optical, chromosome-contact and genetic maps. We also report the sequencing of two diploids from the ancestral gene pools of quinoa, which enables the identification of sub-genomes in quinoa, and reduced-coverage genome sequences for 22 other samples of the allotetraploid goosefoot complex. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of the transcription factor likely to control the production of anti-nutritional triterpenoid saponins found in quinoa seeds, including a mutation that appears to cause alternative splicing and a premature stop codon in sweet quinoa strains. These genomic resources are an important first step towards the genetic improvement of quinoa.

 Proper regulation and management of energy, substrate diversity and quantity, as well as macromolecular synthesis and breakdown processes, are fundamental to cellular and organismal survival and are paramount to health. Cellular and multicellular organization are defended by the immune response, a robust and critical system through which self is distinguished from non-self, pathogenic signals are recognized and eliminated, and tissue homeostasis is safeguarded. Many layers of evolutionarily conserved interactions occur between immune response and metabolism. Proper maintenance of this delicate balance is crucial for health and has important implications for many pathological states such as obesity, diabetes, and other chronic non-communicable diseases.

 The toxicity of misfolded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction are pivotal factors that promote age-associated functional neuronal decline and neurodegenerative disease. Accordingly, neurons invest considerable cellular resources in chaperones, protein degradation, autophagy and mitophagy to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality. Complicating the challenges of neuroprotection, misfolded human disease proteins and mitochondria can move into neighbouring cells via unknown mechanisms, which may promote pathological spread. Here we show that adult neurons from Caenorhabditis elegans extrude large (approximately 4 μm) membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that can contain protein aggregates and organelles. Inhibition of chaperone expression, autophagy or the proteasome, in addition to compromising mitochondrial quality, enhances the production of exophers. Proteotoxically stressed neurons that generate exophers subsequently function better than similarly stressed neurons that did not produce exophers. The extruded exopher transits through surrounding tissue in which some contents appear degraded, but some non-degradable materials can subsequently be found in more remote cells, suggesting secondary release. Our observations suggest that exopher-genesis is a potential response to rid cells of neurotoxic components when proteostasis and organelle function are challenged. We propose that exophers are components of a conserved mechanism that constitutes a fundamental, but formerly unrecognized, branch of neuronal proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control, which, when dysfunctional or diminished with age, might actively contribute to pathogenesis in human neurodegenerative disease and brain ageing.

            <p>Human cells have twenty-three pairs of chromosomes. In cancer, however, genes can be amplified in chromosomes or in circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), although the frequency and functional importance of ecDNA are not understood. We performed whole-genome sequencing, structural modelling and cytogenetic analyses of 17 different cancer types, including analysis of the structure and function of chromosomes during metaphase of 2,572 dividing cells, and developed a software package called ECdetect to conduct unbiased, integrated ecDNA detection and analysis. Here we show that ecDNA was found in nearly half of human cancers; its frequency varied by tumour type, but it was almost never found in normal cells. Driver oncogenes were amplified most commonly in ecDNA, thereby increasing transcript level. Mathematical modelling predicted that ecDNA amplification would increase oncogene copy number and intratumoural heterogeneity more effectively than chromosomal amplification. We validated these predictions by quantitative analyses of cancer samples. The results presented here suggest that ecDNA contributes to accelerated evolution in cancer.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21356">doi: 10.1038/nature21356</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/bTQ_lSXY8Bs" width="1" />

 Malignant neoplasms evolve in response to changes in oncogenic signalling. Cancer cell plasticity in response to evolutionary pressures is fundamental to tumour progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. Here we determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity in a conditional oncogenic Kras mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy that displays considerable phenotypic diversity and morphological heterogeneity. In this model, stochastic extinction of oncogenic Kras signalling and emergence of Kras-independent escaper populations (cells that acquire oncogenic properties) are associated with de-differentiation and aggressive biological behaviour. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of Kras-independent escapers reveal the presence of Smarcb1–Myc-network-driven mesenchymal reprogramming and independence from MAPK signalling. A somatic mosaic model of PDAC, which allows time-restricted perturbation of cell fate, shows that depletion of Smarcb1 activates the Myc network, driving an anabolic switch that increases protein metabolism and adaptive activation of endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-induced survival pathways. Increased protein turnover renders mesenchymal sub-populations highly susceptible to pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the cellular proteostatic machinery and the IRE1-α–MKK4 arm of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response pathway. Specifically, combination regimens that impair the unfolded protein responses block the emergence of aggressive mesenchymal subpopulations in mouse and patient-derived PDAC models. These molecular and biological insights inform a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting aggressive mesenchymal features of PDAC.

In particular, <strong>neurons consume high amounts of energy when they communicate to one another</strong> during the process known as synaptic transmission, in which a neuron releases neurotransmitters that will be received and “understood” by the next neuron. Synaptic transmission is continuously taking place and therefore the brain is never in a fully “resting” state; on the contrary, it undergoes rapid and intense changes in activity, <strong>requiring increased amounts of energy in more active regions to maintain function</strong>. To get an idea on how intense can be the activation of certain regions in the brain during cognitive function, a spectacular example can be observed in the recordings of neuronal activity in zebrafish brains by the Ahrens’ lab at Janelia Research Campus: visualizing at least 80% of the neurons of the brain in action we can see the “electrical storm” of swimming zebrafish “thinking”!</p>
<p></p>

<p>Not surprisingly<strong>, failures in supplying energy to the brain rapidly result in cognitive dysfunction</strong>, for example during bouts of hyperglycemia or ischemic events, leading to profound and immediate suppression of neuronal function. Neurons seem to be particularly dependent on energy availability and therefore scientists have long thought that they maintained a large and steady amount of energy available to be used at any moment. However, research in the recent years by the labs of Timothy Ryan at Weill Cornell Medicine and Daniel Colon-Ramos at Yale University have discovered that <strong>energy in neurons is produced on an as-needed basis during neuronal activity </strong>at the presynaptic terminal, where neurotransmission is initiated. Neurons utilize glucose during activity to produce ATP, the intracellular fuel used by any cell, and use that newly-generated ATP to restore neuronal processes to be able to transmit information again in the next cycle (1, 2). How this is possible at the biochemical level, however, was not well understood until now.</p>
<p>Ashrafi et al. report in the <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(16)30993-X">Jan. 19th issue of Neuron</a> (3) that neurons produce energy on demand using the same mechanism as muscle cells during exercise. The team found that synapses can increase the production of ATP from glucose during activity by sequestering additional glucose from the media surrounding the neuron: <strong>active neurons mobilize more copies of a glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the neuronal surface, which allows increasing the ability of the neuron to capture glucose</strong> to use it to generate energy in the form of ATP. For neuroscientist this is unprecedented since despite the uncountable differences between contracting muscle cells and neurons, the mechanism that allows both of them to “exercise” is basically the same. The researchers also explored some of the details on how this is possible and discovered that many features at the molecular level are conserved when compared to muscle cells, meaning that <strong>“exercising” synapses are a lot like exercising muscle</strong>. Ashrafi et al. discovered that when neurons begin to release neurotransmitters, the enzyme AMPK (AMP-activated kinase) is activated. This enzyme acts as a metabolic sensor in many cells to monitor subtle changes in energy availability and whenever energy is starting to be spent to transmit information, AMPK is activated and induces the insertion of more copies of GLUT4 on the cell surface. The researchers also demonstrate that if they experimentally block either AMPK activation or GLUT4’s ability to capture glucose, neurons are unable to sustain synaptic transmission for more than a few seconds. This is of tremendous importance for the brain since cognitive function relies on accurate and continuous neuronal function and demonstrates how essential neuronal metabolism is for synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>Since insulin has been shown to mobilize GLUT4 to the surface in muscle and fat cells, this research opens a new important question: is it possible that insulin may affect/tune brain function? Surely we will see more research on this in the future!</p>

<p>Imagine you’ve reached the fine age of 77 and you hear news of a school reunion. You’re going to have the chance to meet up with several of your former classmates who you haven’t seen since you were fourteen-years-old. They’ll look a lot different, of course, but what about their personality? Will they be broadly the same as they were back then?</p>
<p>Past research that’s looked at trait changes from adolescence to mid-life has shown there tends to be a moderate amount of stability, so too research that’s looked at changes from mid-life into old age. Put these two sets of data together and you might expect to see at least some personality stability across an entire lifespan. Your classmates probably won’t have changed completely.</p>
<p>Yet that’s not what a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5144810/">recent open-access study</a> in <em>Psychology and Aging</em> has found: the first – to the authors’ knowledge – to measure personality in the same people in their adolescence and then again in old age. By covering a period of 63 years, this in a sense is the longest ever personality study. But contrary to what we might expect based on previous findings, Matthew Harris and his colleagues at the University of Edinburgh failed to find any correlation between their participants’ personality scores at age 14 and their scores on the same items at the age of 77. “Personality in older age may be quite different from personality in childhood,” they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-18717"></span></p>
<p>The story begins in 1950 when a group of researchers asked teachers to rate the personality of 1,208 fourteen-year-olds in Scotland (actually a sub-sample from a much larger study examining almost every child born in the country in 1936). The teachers rated the teens on six questionnaire items each addressing their Self-confidence, Perseverance, Stability of Moods, Conscientiousness, Originality and Desire to Learn, respectively. Ratings for these six items correlated strongly and indeed, although it’s not a perfect match, the teachers were rating the teens on something very close to what today is referred to as trait Conscientiousness (Harris and his team say the items are collectively measuring another similar trait that they call “dependability”). The children also took intelligence tests.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012 and Harris and his team managed to find 635 of the teenagers who were assessed back in 1950. One hundred and seventy-four of them, now aged 77, agreed to take part in a new round of testing. The group, including 92 women, rated themselves on the same six items that their teachers had rated them on all those years ago, and they nominated a close friend or relative to rate them on the items too. The elderly participants also completed some intelligence tests and measures of their general wellbeing.</p>
<p>To the researchers’ surprise they found there was no correlation between the ratings the participants received when they were aged 14 and the ratings they gave themselves at age 77, or the ratings they received at age 77 from a friend or relative. This was true whether looking at the individual personality items, such as Stability of Moods, or at a single “dependability” trait based on amalgamating across the six items.</p>
<p>Moreover, although dependability at age 77 correlated with current wellbeing, the participants’ dependability at age 14 was not linked with their wellbeing in late life, seemingly contradicting past research that’s found higher scores on the related trait of conscientiousness are associated with superior wellbeing decades later.</p>
<p>Does this mean that our personalities in old age will bear no relation to our personalities in mid-adolescence? Such an idea is not completely far-fetched. Late adolescence and early adulthood are times of significant personality development and change; old age too can be a time that our characters evolve. Because of the impressive time span covered by this research, the participants will have lived through both these periods of major change, not to mention the accumulation of subtler personality adjustments through their lives.</p>
<p>“The longer the interval between two assessments of personality, the weaker the relationship between the two tends to be,” Harris and his team concluded. “Our results suggest that, when the interval is increased to as much as 63 years, there is hardly any relationship at all.”</p>
<p>That’s the headline result, but a psychology study covering such a long period of time faces many hurdles, among them the fact that personality theory has changed a lot over the decades. Today, there’s a near-consensus that personality is best conceptualised as being made up of five main traits (including Extraversion, Neuroticism etc) but that wasn’t the case back in 1950, which is part of the reason for the rather superficial and incomplete assessment of personality. It’s possible that if the participants had been assessed on a comprehensive, modern personality scale at age 14 and again at age 77, that we would see at least some correlation in scores.</p>
<p>Other methodological problems include the fact the teachers’ ratings of the teens were likely biased by their knowledge of the teenagers’ academic prowess (indeed, the personality scores they gave the teens correlated with the teens’ IQ; though even after attempting to “correct” for this in some complex analysis, there was still little evidence of personality stability across the decades). Yet another problem is that the sample that the researchers were able to reach in 2012 was a highly selected subgroup of the original sample, scoring much higher on average on dependability and intelligence: this may also have affected the ability to detect signs of personality stability. All of which makes it very difficult to interpret these new findings, interesting though they are.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>We’re pretty sure we can measure the bioactivity of almost anything.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>‘Bioactive’ is one of those tricky terms… many things to many people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/trinity-bioactives-limited">Trinity Bioactive’s</a> definition of it is a compound that does something to living tissue.</p>
<p>Trinity’s expertise is to prove these mostly natural products, say skin cream, honey based products, green-lipped mussel powders and oils ‘do’ something. They use other scientists’ internationally published peer reviewed methods to verify that product X has Y effect; evidence of bioactivity.</p>
<p>Trinity solves the problem of health product companies and developers of being able to undeniably demonstrate their stuff works.</p>
<p>To this end, Trinity reckons that it can measure the biological presence and activity of almost anything, if it exists.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1025" style="width: 180px;"><img alt="Dr Paul Davis" class="size-medium wp-image-1025" height="300" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMAG1536-170x300.jpg" width="170" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr Paul Davis – Research Director and CEO – Trinity Bioactives</p></div>
<p>It’s Research Director and CEO <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/users/7525913741/paul-davis">Paul Davis</a> is tempted to say there’s no product or extract whose biological activity Trinity can’t measure… but being the experienced biomedical researcher he is he’s better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>The Wellington-based laboratory, with satellite offices in Melbourne and Salt Lake City uses assays or models as a proxy to establish that an extract, mixture, compound or product has biologically active and available properties.</p>
<p>Mostly PhD holders make up the company’s five (plus) team who use the almost 200 assay models to measure a diverse range of biological potencies and efficiencies. Many are cell cultures; perhaps of stomach cells or cancer, or that measure diabetic or skin responses.</p>
<p>“All of our methodologies are peer reviewed, and written up and published in reputable international scientific and medical journals,” says Paul.</p>
<p>“When we put together our study protocols, we cite the papers the methods are based on.”</p>
<p>The studies (safety and toxicity as well) of mostly natural products include the efficacies of honey, bee propolis, dairy products, green lipped mussels, traditional medicines, emu and other oils, and a number of other raw materials</p>
<p>Manufacturers and would-be makers of nutraceuticals, functional foods, skin care compounds and products sold over the counter at the likes of drug stores (chemists), supermarkets and health food stores are among the global clients for whom Trinity carries out its specialized tests.</p>
<p>These include companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing new processing methods to improve their products</li>
<li>looking for useful functionality from their biological waste streams</li>
<li>investigating new activities for existing bioactives and products.</li>
<li>investigating the possible synergistic effect of combining two or more compounds</li>
</ul>
<p>“Everything we do is customized to the clients’ requirements,” says Paul.</p>
<p>“This is based on a Study Plan; an agreement and approval of what and how we are going to measure a biological presence and response. After the conclusion of the study a confidential report is supplied back to the client.”</p>
<p>“That’s why our conversations with clients beforehand are so important. We’re aware of the latest regulations out of Europe or the USA, we’re up with the latest modeling research, we appreciate a client wants authentic and verifiable data to provide them with an evidence-led, marketing story.”</p>
<p><img alt="Trinity Bioactives Lab" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1026" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMAG1538-1024x579.jpg" width="600" /></p>
<p>Davis says that the experience, methodologies and consultancy practices developed over the company’s 22 year history are major factors in providing cost-effective proof of bio-activity.</p>
<p>The other advantage of operating in a tightly connected, highly-educated, well-regulated market such as New Zealand is that Trinity Bioactives is able to link into the expertise of other researchers and science providers. These include the universities (including the medical schools), the crown research institutes, other R&amp;D companies and institutions and clinical trials groups.<br />
“We have a real concentration of facilities and expertise quite close to us,” says Paul.</p>
<p>“We know what we and others can do, and can tap into that. It means that when someone asks if we can do something, we don’t need to say no as, if it is not in our portfolio, we know someone who can help. We just need a day or two to work on a plan… We almost invariably get back with a way we’d provide scientific evidence and proof of what they wish to validate.”</p>
<p>“From a bioactivity point of view, there’s not much that we or our networks can’t scientifically measure and validate,” says Paul.</p>
<p>“We have expertise, connectivity, and can answer important questions for clients about their products.. We realize that our clients are seeking data to assist the marketing of their products and we are happy to assist..”</p>

<p>A certain amount of worrying is a normal part of life, especially these days with barely a moment passing without a disconcerting headline landing in your news feed. But for some people, their worrying reaches pathological levels. They just can’t stop wondering “What if …?”. It becomes distressing and feels out of control. In the formal jargon, they would likely be diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, but excessive worrying is also a part of other conditions like panic disorder. There are many factors that contribute to anxiety problems in general, but <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051116300965?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">a new review</a> in <em>Biological Psychology</em> homes in on the cognitive and emotional factors that specifically contribute to prolonged bouts of worry. Its take-home points make an interesting read for anyone who considers themselves a worrier, and for therapists, the review highlights some approaches to help anxious clients get a hold of their excessive worrying.</p>
<p><span id="more-18521"></span></p>
<p>The review authors, Graham Davey and Frances Meeten at the University of Sussex and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, explain that what gets many pathological worriers worrying in the first place is that they seem to be highly vigilant to any sources of threat and danger, and if there’s any ambiguity about whether a situation is threatening or not, they will tend to interpret it as being dangerous. If they haven’t yet heard from their daughter today, for instance, the problem worrier will not only notice this fact, they will also contemplate that it’s because she’s in trouble, rather than simply busy.</p>
<p>Studies have shown the causal role that these attentional biases seem to have by testing what happens when people are trained instead to pay more attention to positive aspects of situations, or to interpret ambiguous situations more positively. Asked to spend time after the training sitting quietly, focused on their breathing, worriers who’ve had the training report fewer intrusive worries compared with control participants.</p>
<p>Once a worry bout kicks in, one of the things that keeps it going in problem worriers is their deep held belief that worry is actually a good thing. This doesn’t make much sense at first. How can excessive worriers think worry is good when they find it so distressing? But while they find the worrying distressing and upsetting, and it feels out of control, research shows they also believe that it can help prevent bad things from happening, that it will help them be prepared for bad outcomes, and that it aids problem solving.</p>
<p>Related to this, problem worriers tend to have a kind of perfectionist approach to worrying. They think they can’t stop worrying until they’ve finished, in the sense of working through every eventuality and solving every problem. Less anxious people, in contrast, will tend to follow a principle of stopping worrying once they don’t feel like it anymore. Teaching pathological worriers to change their approach, to learn to stop worrying once they had enough of it, has been shown to prevent them from getting stuck in such long worry bouts.</p>
<p>Another key factor is low mood. Problem worriers tend to experience more negative moods, which are known to encourage a more analytical thinking style. In turn, this lays the ground for an overly zealous, perfectionist worry style that is in a sense impossible satisfy and leads to more distress and anxiety. Pathological worriers also tend to use their ongoing negative mood as a barometer for whether their worrying has been successful. The fact that they still feel down and anxious tells them that they’ve yet to anticipate or prepare for every disconcerting eventuality. Using “mood as information” in this way creates a kind of cognitive and emotional trap that propagates yet more worry.</p>
<p>You should seek professional help if you feel your worrying is becoming a problem, but the review offers some simple take-aways for breaking out of occasional uncontrolled worry bouts or preventing them happening in the first place. Because of the way that negative moods contribute to the perseveration of worry bouts, for instance, simply trying to combat a generally low mood is likely to help. This may be easier said that done, but if you can lift your mood (for example through <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/21/walking-lifts-your-mood-even-when-you-dont-expect-it-to/">going for regular walks</a>), the evidence suggests a knock-on benefit will be less prolonged worrying.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculously simple, but also thinking about the idea of stopping worrying when you’ve had enough of it, rather than when the worrying is somehow “finished” or “complete”, could be beneficial. In fact, earlier research has shown that merely learning about the cognitive and emotional factors that feed excessive worry can help some people.</p>
<p>From a therapeutic perspective, the review suggests that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/03/attention-training-can-wire-your-brain-to-be-less-scaredy-cat/">attentional</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/01/working-memory-training-could-help-beat-anxiety/">training</a> programmes (including “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092585/">cognitive bias modification</a>“) are likely to help prevent worry bouts from starting in the first place. Therapists could also consider engaging with anxious clients’ explicit beliefs about worrying, such as that it can prevent bad things happening or that they need to continue worrying until they’ve covered all the issues. Meanwhile, acceptance- or mindfulness-based approaches could help alleviate clients’ distress about worry, which in turn would help reduce the part that negative mood plays in prolonging a worry bout. As for where our deep-seated and sometime unhelpful beliefs about worry come from in the first place, Davey and Meeten said this is something awaiting further research.</p>

 Synthetic lethality and collateral lethality are two well-validated conceptual strategies for identifying therapeutic targets in cancers with tumour-suppressor gene deletions. Here, we explore an approach to identify potential synthetic-lethal interactions by screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns in cancer genomes. We sought to identify ‘synthetic-essential’ genes: those that are occasionally deleted in some cancers but are almost always retained in the context of a specific tumour-suppressor deficiency. We also posited that such synthetic-essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic-lethal interactions, this approach uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor CHD1 as a putative synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancers. In PTEN-deficient prostate and breast cancers, CHD1 depletion profoundly and specifically suppressed cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination–proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency results in stabilization of CHD1, which in turn engages the trimethyl lysine-4 histone H3 modification to activate transcription of the pro-tumorigenic TNF–NF-κB gene network. This study identifies a novel PTEN pathway in cancer and provides a framework for the discovery of ‘trackable’ targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies.

 The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that more than 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.

 Exceptionally preserved fossils provide crucial insights into extinct body plans and organismal evolution. Molluscs, one of the most disparate animal phyla, radiated rapidly during the early Cambrian period (approximately 535–520 million years ago (Ma)). The problematic fossil taxa Halkieria and Orthrozanclus (grouped in Sachitida) have been assigned variously to stem-group annelids, brachiopods, stem-group molluscs or stem-group aculiferans (Polyplacophora and Aplacophora), but their affinities have remained controversial owing to a lack of preserved diagnostic characters. Here we describe a new early sachitid, Calvapilosa kroegeri gen. et sp. nov. from the Fezouata biota of Morocco (Early Ordovician epoch, around 478 Ma). The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single large anterior shell plate and polystichous radula bearing a median tooth and several lateral and uncinal teeth in more than 125 rows. Its flattened body is covered by hollow spinose sclerites, and a smooth, ventral girdle flanks an extensive mantle cavity. Phylogenetic analyses resolve C. kroegeri as a stem-group aculiferan together with other single-plated forms such as Maikhanella (Siphogonuchites) and Orthrozanclus; Halkieria is recovered closer to the aculiferan crown. These genera document the stepwise evolution of the aculiferan body plan from forms with a single, almost conchiferan-like shell through two-plated taxa such as Halkieria, to the eight-plated crown-group aculiferans. C. kroegeri therefore provides key evidence concerning the long debate about the crown molluscan affinities of sachitids. This new discovery strongly suggests that the possession of only a single calcareous shell plate and the presence of unmineralised sclerites are plesiomorphic (an ancestral trait) for the molluscan crown.

            <p>In an attempt to explain the internal processes governing the occurrences in the economic world, neuroeconomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field attempting to merge psychology and economic theory. Simply put, the biological basis of behavioral economics; how and why people make judgements and decisions with economic consequences in terms of simple cerebral biology. But why should we be interested? Surely considering the brain in more behaviorist, 20<sup>th</sup> century ‘black box’ terms is much more simple – input information, output decision. And whilst, arguably, many economic theories do consider human behavior and choice in such a way, psychology would argue otherwise. Neuroeconomics attempts to bridge the gap between input and output, analyzing the chemicals and structures, which provide the biological basis for individuality in processing and decision-making.</p>
<p>Whilst the majority of the cerebral cortex is in fact dedicated to the interpretation of such complex or ‘higher order’ judgment functioning, the study of the biological response is relatively limited. This is surprising, given the untold benefits to corporates and executives whom, in theory, would thrive from findings; sectors in marketing, education, health, managerial and so on, in which research into human heuristics and biases would greatly inform product, workforce, and knowledge development. So why are not all corporations capitalizing on the biological blueprints for consumer, workforce and public decision-making? One word: ethics.</p>
<p>Neuroeconomics assumes that the neurotransmission and chemical balance in cerebral areas responsible for higher order and consciousness (such as the prefrontal cortex) result in the socioemotional basis for most of our decisions. Yes, contrary to economic theory, most human decision is not rational or uniform, but relies on the illogicality of trust, affect and gratification. So how ethical is it for these processes to be manipulated for capital gain? Brain imaging techniques and genetic screening in consumers, the aging population, even Wall street traders has given us greater insight into the likelihood of particular decisions, judgment and risk taking, allowing those utilizing the information to cash in on their carefully biologically tailored advertisements, behavioral change interventions, and so on. Does this mean in years to come scientists will be able to access unconscious desires and preferences for profit? Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>Whilst the ethical implications of feeding the consumer’s biological process for preference in questionable at best, using these reductionist techniques to better inform consumer choice is not necessarily beneficial. Studies have shown that whilst initial choice in blind tasting, for example, is unconscious, contrary decisions are made based upon branding, cultural preference and so on. Given that we do tend to make decisions consciously in terms of consumption, these techniques may be somewhat redundant.</p>
<p>Moreover, to an extent, neuroeconomic study still relies on the same economic principles of assumption – this being that human brains, unfortunately for scientists, do not work in uniformity, and rather, decisions are made irrationally, regardless of the unconscious biology informing us otherwise. Therefore the direction of neuroeconomic study would do well to focus on what creates this irrationality and uniqueness in behavior – are we simply unconventional when we want just for the sake of it? Certainly research must be conducted with temporality in mind – understanding the static structure of choice and judgement with no consideration to situational influence is redundant in itself, let alone in combination with the unpredictability of individual human decision.</p>
<p>More specifically within the field of neuroeconomics, neuromarketing seems to provide the most controversy in terms of its future applications. Currently, the field aims to utilize the findings of neurological study regarding consumer choice, and aims to appeal to certain unconscious mechanisms, which govern decision boosting purchase and profit – in theory. Previous research has already attempted to determine the chemical basis of ‘trust’ (well established as oxytocin) as a powerful component in judgement and decision in terms of brand trust and familiarity. Whilst this may be a well-established marketing technique in the corporate toolbox, the contribution of chemical ‘manipulation’ certainly lends towards the unease fueling ethical qualms in the area. In the same vein, gender differences in cerebral organization is well established to predict judgment and choice behavior, and is well marketed to tailor to the different sexes, however, the thought of a brand ‘controlling’ consumers through biological means raises ethical issues in this case. Although, these techniques are well posited in countless campaigns, thus perhaps the field of neuroeconomics only provides a biological explanation for consumer behavior, which is already time-honored and utilized.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ethical implications of probing into the deepest levels of consciousness for the sake of an ad campaign, the field has many benefits, which should be considered in comparison. It must firstly be addressed, in fact, that neuroeconomics and health psychology are long lost sisters, and whilst we praise the work of psychologically informed public health campaigns, neuroeconomics must also be considered as a valuable informant. In such a way that neuroeconomics may be used as the basis to inform such behavioral psychology, it must also be considered as the biological basis for behavioral economics, providing valuable contribution to wholly effective public change for the better. Similarly, development in managerial sectors, workforce training and motivation has already proven to benefit from neuroeconomical research in terms of ‘reframing’. Neural study has indicated the more efficient work of employees when focusing on creative and emotional thinking, as opposed to logics and numerical training traditionally employed (as demonstrated by our human preference to avoid rationality in decision making). Focusing on the emotional intelligence and providing encouragement and training directed towards a more imaginative decision making process has innumerable benefits in employment satisfaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, applications of neuroeconomics to psychiatry must be considered in weighing up the pros and cons of the field. If it is possible to identify a specific genetic or chemical contribution resulting in a decline in cognitive functioning, thus ultimately leading to psychiatric disorder (with specific symptoms in impaired judgment and decision making symptoms), both fields are mutually informed. More simply, identifying such biological structures and process in neuroeconomic study better informs the neurological basis for psychiatric disorders, aiding medical or therapeutic intervention. In a similar way, the study of psychiatric disorder can be used as ‘case study’ for areas of cerebral dis-regulation and its effects on judgment and decision.</p>
<p>Whilst I do not claim even close to omniscient in the aforementioned fields of neuroscience, economics or behavioral psychology, I would dismiss the claim that neuroeconomics is a redundant area of study, but highlight the issues surrounding the biological basis for ‘controlling’ consumer behavior. Regardless, the need for further research concerning a biological model of decision is clear, with accuracy in the field’s current conclusions questionable at present.</p>

            <img alt="Are people paying attention to warning labels?" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Alcohol-Heineken-Beer-Bottles-1992201-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As part of the <a href="https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/alcohol-pledges/">public health responsibility deal</a> in 2011, alcoholic beverages companies in the UK made a series of pledges to help foster a culture of responsible drinking. One of these pledges was to ensure that 80% of drink containers include labels detailing alcohol content, daily intake guidance and warning against drinking during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Whilst these pledges may be well intentioned, their actual effectiveness has been called into question. Researchers argue that the most effective strategies to reduce alcohol related injury are <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12855/abstract;jsessionid=4672011288F47CCC0DD2308562874FBA.f04t02">not consistently reflected</a> in the pledges and that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395901000779">labeling is generally ineffective</a> in modifying consumer behaviors.</p>
<p>The effects of labeling on alcohol is an area that is poorly understand in general. For instance, there is considerable uncertainty over whether the labeling of lower strength alcohol products reduces alcohol consumption, with consumers purchasing these drinks over higher strength counterparts, or whether it in fact encourages higher consumption due to ‘self-licensing’. This was investigated in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3956-2">systematic review</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. It found there was low quality evidence suggesting consumers’ perceptions of products could be shifted by low alcohol labeling but there was still considerable uncertainty over what the effects might be.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages</p></blockquote>
<p>The apparent ineffectiveness of warning labels on alcohol products has been explored in another <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4055-8">recent study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. Here the authors theorized that the limited effect of warning labels may be due to consumers paying little attention to them. It has previously been shown that consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages. Increasing attention to warning to warning labels may then be the key to increasing their effectiveness. This has been shown in bar visitors who <a href="http://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsa.1993.54.457">drank less alcohol</a> when their attention was drawn to warning labels.</p>
<p>To find out if warning labels could impact alcohol consumption on a population level, if they were made sufficiently attention grabbing, the authors devised two studies that investigated how much attention is paid to warning labels and how individual differences in drinking behaviors are associated with attention to warning labels.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>The authors recruited students at the University of Liverpool. In the first study, 60 participants were asked to view images of beverage containers on a screen whilst their eye movements were tracked. Students were told to pay close attention as their memories of the containers would be tested.</p>
<p>In the second study the viewing phase was proceeded by either an alcohol intervention talk to manipulate participants (120) drinking motivations or a control intervention giving study advice. The researchers also manipulated attention to alcohol packaging using brightly drawn borders on either the warning label or the branding. The participants then completed a questionnaire to asses motivations to drink in the following week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Results of the study showed that although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels or influence motivations to reduce drinking. Study participants who viewed containers with highlighted health warnings did fixate longer on these however this did not affect drinking intentions.</p>
<p>The researchers propose that a possible reason that participants did not particularly notice the warning labels is because they only occupy 5% of the packaging. This is supported by research on warning labels in tobacco adverts which found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034984?dopt=Abstract">message recall</a> was increased with larger labels. Other reasons could be that current warning labels do not show the consequences of exceeding the recommended intake and features of the labels like the “drink responsibly” message are associated with <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871614009156">promoting the drink</a> and therefore seen as part of the branding.</p>
<p>In order to make alcohol warning labels more effective, the researchers call for further studies exploring the effects of label design and content on consumers’ attention to them. They also suggest that increasing the noticeability of warning labels could be achieved through plain packaging, graphic warnings and front of pack labeling which have all been shown to be effective in food and tobacco research.</p>
