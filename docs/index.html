<p>This summer, the arXiv development team will begin work on the next major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which will be based on the official <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> update. TeX is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.</p>
<p>This year’s update will provide enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team will also use this opportunity to address outstanding bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.</p>
<p>arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new TeX Live release is expected to become available Fall 2020.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>The way parents feel and behave often rubs off on their children. Kids’ own life paths can be influenced by the strength of their parents’ <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/24/the-quality-of-the-relationship-between-parents-can-shape-their-childrens-life-paths/">romantic relationship</a>, for example, or <u><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/">how often their parents lie to them.</a></u></p>
<p>We may also pick things up as our parents try to hide them, as <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000664">new research</a> published in the <em>Journal of Family Psychology </em>suggests. Even when parents try to hide their stress, the team finds, they can still pass on those feelings to their children anyway.</p>
<p><span id="more-39598"></span>To examine how stress is passed on from parent to child, Sara Waters from Washington State University Vancouver and colleagues looked at the physiological responses that occur when parents suppressed their anxiety. A total of 107 parents and their children aged between 7 and 11 were first fitted with ECG sensors to measure the heart’s  “pre-ejection period” (PEP), a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation, before spending five minutes listening to soothing music through headphones.</p>
<p>Parents were then separated from their children and completed a stress test, in which they were asked to give a five minute speech about themselves and then answer five minutes of questions in front of two evaluators. During the test, evaluators provided negative, non-verbal feedback, shaking their heads, crossing their arms and frowning.</p>
<p>The stressed-out parents were then assigned to either a “suppression” or control condition, before being reunited with their children. Those in the suppression condition were asked to mask their emotion, behaving in such a way that their child would not be able to know they were feeling anything at all, while those in the control condition were told to act naturally, as they would at home. Parent and child were then asked to engage in a six minute conversation about a source of conflict in their relationship, a six minute cooperation task in which they built with blocks, and six minutes of free play.</p>
<p>Trained observers who rated these interactions found that parents and children were less warm and engaged with each other in the suppression condition. There was also a significant link between a mother’s physiological stress and that of her child: mothers’ PEP reactivity at one time point was related to children’s reactivity shortly thereafter. In the control group, however, stress was not transmitted from mother to child.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, stress wasn’t transmitted from fathers to their children, which the team believes is down to how men deal with stress outside of laboratory conditions. Because men are more likely to say they’re fine when they’re not, while women are more likely to show how they’re feeling, the team argues that children were more used to emotional suppression in their male caretakers and were therefore less affected. However, fathers in the suppression condition did become linked to their children’s physiology in the opposite direction: they picked up stress from their children, not the other way around.</p>
<p>As the study focused purely on pairings between a single child and parent, future research could focus on emotional suppression and stress in larger groups or family systems, exploring how a second parent, sibling or other family member affects this physiological link, for instance. Researchers could also examine the techniques that parents use in the control condition: their warm and engaging interactions may stem from specific, positive emotion regulation strategies rather than simply being the result of not suppressing their emotions.</p>
<p>Hiding stress from your children is entirely understandable — you may wish to protect them from negative feelings and see emotional suppression as the best way to do that. But, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/wsu-ein042020.php">as Waters says</a>, it may be more comforting for children “to have their feelings honoured” — listening to them honestly, rather than brushing over them altogether.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tapirs-poop-may-be-key-reviving-amazon-rainforest">Tapirs may be key to reviving the Amazon. All they need to do is poop</a></h4>

<p>Beneath the viridescent understory
of the Brazilian Amazon, ecologist Lucas Paolucci has been honing his skills
for hunting tapir dung. In this region’s degraded rain forests, he sees the
piglike mammal’s enormous piles of poop as a treasure. </p>



<p>Chock full of seeds, the dung from trunk-nosed lowland
tapirs (<em>Tapirus terrestris</em>) may be key in regenerating forests that have been hit
by intensive logging and slash-and-burn agriculture, says Paolucci, of the Amazon
Environmental Research Institute in Brazil. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3087707" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/043020_gd_tapir_inline-482x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087707">Ecologist Lucas Paolucci, shown here with a pile of tapir dung in Mato Grosso, Brazil, is studying how tapirs and dung beetles may help aid forest recovery.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087707">Michelle Wong</span></figure></div>



<p>“Tapirs in Brazil are known as the gardeners of the forests,” he says. Feasting on the fruit of more than 300 plant species, the animals travel through the forest underbrush with their bellies full of seeds. That includes seeds from large, carbon-storing trees like mess apple trees (<em>Bellucia grossularioides</em>) that can’t pass through smaller animals<em>. </em>So the lowland tapir, South America’s largest mammal, is one of the key agents dispersing seeds throughout the Amazon. </p>



<p>Rooting through poop piles in Mato Grosso, a state in
west-central Brazil, wasn’t how Paolucci began his career; he studied ants in
Brazil’s coastal Atlantic Forest. Later, he began to wonder how forest fires in
the Amazon might affect the rain forest’s insect communities. And then, he
became intrigued by the monstrous dung piles — each pile “bigger than my head,”
he says.  </p>





<p>In 2016, Paolucci joined other researchers studying the
role of these magnanimous defecators in restoring disturbed forests. The team
conducted an experiment in eastern Mato Grosso, where two forest plots had been
control burned to varying degrees from 2004 to 2010. One plot was burned every
year, and the other every three years. A third plot was left untouched as a
control group. </p>



<p>Paolucci’s colleagues walked through the plots,
recording the location of 163 dung piles and comparing them with camera-trap
recordings of tapirs roaming through the area. Then the team sieved the fecal
findings to separate out seeds, counting a total of 129,204 seeds from 24 plant
species. The camera traps showed tapirs spending far more time in burned areas
than in the pristine forest, perhaps enjoying the sunshine away from the forest
canopy, Paolucci says. The animals also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12627">deposited
more than three times as many seeds per hectare</a> in
burned areas as in the untouched forest. 
</p>

</div>The dung of piglike mammals called tapirs (one shown) is chock full of seeds, and may be an overlooked part of regenerating Amazonian forests that have been hit by intensive logging and slash-and-burn agriculture, an ecologist argues.</figure>



<p>Just months after the team published those findings in
March of 2019 in <em>Biotropica</em>, the
Amazon saw <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-amazon-rainforest-fires-climate-emissions-oxygen">one of
its most destructive fire seasons</a> in
years (<em>SN: 8/23/19</em>). That made
Paolucci even more determined to understand tapirs’ role in forests’ recovery.
But he knows the tapirs can’t be doing the job alone. </p>



<p>So Paolucci went back to the insects he began his career
with, studying how they might be partners in planting new growth. Tapirs may be
leaving fecal fortunes on the forest floor, but dung beetles are actually
responsible for pushing the poop around. The insects will break off and bury
small pieces of dung, including any seeds within, to snack on later. That helps
seed germination get going. </p>



<p>In early 2019, Paolucci returned to the Amazon to collect
20 kilograms of tapir dung, which he broke apart and molded into 700-gram
clumps. In each clump, he inserted plastic beads as dummy seeds and then
returned the poop pellets to the field. After 24 hours, Paolucci collected the
dung clumps again and counted how many beads remained. Those missing had
presumably been rolled away by the beetles, and, by proxy, indicated how many
seeds would potentially grow into plants one day. Paolucci hopes to publish
these results in 2021. </p>

</div>Dung beetles skitter over tapir dung in the Amazon rainforest in this sped-up video. The insects will break off and bury small pieces of dung, including any seeds within, to snack on later. That helps seed germination get going and could play a key role in regenerating degraded forests.</figure>



<p>Amazon ranchers are typically required by law to
maintain 80 percent of native forest cover on their properties, but many trees
have been illegally cleared and need to be replanted. Tapirs could provide
cost-effective help with that effort, Paolucci speculates. </p>



<p>But the population of <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/21474/45174127">lowland tapirs</a>, the only tapir species that is widespread throughout the Amazon, is decreasing and is now considered vulnerable, due to habitat loss and hunting for meat. Roughly 20 percent of the Amazon has been destroyed, with another 7 percent expected to be gone by 2030 if current deforestation rates continue. If tapirs fail to thrive, future “seed dispersal is expected to rely even more on organisms such as dung beetles,” Paolucci says.</p>

<p>Hurricane Maria roared across Puerto Rico in late September 2017. The storm caused an estimated $90 billion in damage, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/u-s-power-grid-desperately-needs-upgrades-handle-climate-change">demolished the power grid</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 22</em>) and left more than half of the island’s residents without safe drinking water. </p>



<p>Dachiramarie Vila recalls the smell of gasoline from generators choking the air. </p>



<p>“The smell was everywhere,” says Vila, a 33-year-old mother of two, through a translator. “We felt that we were breathing all those gases night and day.”</p>



<p>The storm flattened Vila’s wooden home, forcing her family to move to her parents’ house, which was also damaged. Then Vila’s 13-year-old son began peeing blood, she says, probably from drinking contaminated water. There was little medical assistance available.</p>





<p>Desperate for help, Vila’s mother, Maritza Garcia Vila, traveled high into the mountains in search of a working cell phone tower because the storm had knocked out 95 percent of the island’s towers. From there, she called Ana Cruz.</p>



<p>Cruz is the coordinator of the Hispanic Office for Local Assistance, or HOLA, part of the city government of Orlando, Fla. <a href="http://www.cityoforlando.net/hola/us/">HOLA has helped new arrivals to the city</a> find jobs, housing and health care since 2004. </p>



<p>But by the end of 2017, HOLA and Orlando faced a daunting task. Hurricane Irma had inundated many of Florida’s coastal cities in early September, and two weeks later, Maria hit Puerto Rico. Those two storms sent as many as 250,000 evacuees, including Vila and her family, into Florida’s narrow interior. </p>



<p>“We were caught off guard,” says Chris Castro, a senior adviser to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. That 2017 wave of climate migrants gave city managers a glimpse into a future for which they need to prepare. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Vila family" class="wp-image-3087544" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050920_cg_destinations_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087544">Dachiramarie Vila (center), her two children (shown), her husband and extended family left Puerto Rico in 2017 for Orlando, Fla., in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.<strong> </strong></span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087544">D. Vila</span></figure>



<p>Orlando is now gearing up to become a destination for future climate migrations, Castro says. “No local government, to my knowledge, is prepared … to deal with the flux of environmental migrants and climate refugees,” he adds. “It’s now very much part of our thought process.” </p>



<p>By 2050, scientists estimate, <a href="https://ehs.unu.edu/blog/5-facts/5-facts-on-climate-migrants.html">climate stressors</a> — including hurricanes, wildfires, drought, extreme heat and flooding from rising seas — could compel between 25 million and 1 billion people around the world to leave their homes and jobs behind, some temporarily, some for good. </p>



<p>For Orlando and other potential destination cities, preparing for those influxes of people, while also bracing for the local impacts of climate change, is a multifaceted challenge. As a starting point, the cities need data, some sense of how many people might arrive. But one of the biggest hitches in planning for the future is that so little is known about where and when people will choose to migrate. </p>



<p>Scientists have devised ways to track and even anticipate modern-day human resettlements, as people move for economic reasons like jobs or for family reasons. There is also a growing body of research based on past migrations spurred by extreme climate events: the treks across the United States during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, for example, or the rush to Orlando following Hurricane Maria, or to Houston in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast in 2005. </p>



<p>But when it comes to projecting such movements into the future, as climate change rapidly transforms landscapes on a never-before-seen scale, “I don’t think we know that much at the moment,” says Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago. “It’s hard to think of what’s going to happen with long-term [climate] change.”</p>





<h4>Becoming a safe haven</h4>



<p>As newcomers poured into Orlando in October 2017, HOLA set up a welcome station at the city’s airport at Dyer’s behest. Among the first to arrive were Vila and 10 family members — her husband and two children, mother and father, younger brother and pregnant sister with her husband and two children. </p>



<p>Leaving Puerto Rico “was very, very, very hard,” Vila says. The family left with only a few suitcases. “We were desperate, with nothing.” </p>



<p>Vila’s mother headed straight to the HOLA table. “When her mother arrived, she started crying,” recalls Cruz, who served as the translator during my conversations with Vila. “I told her to relax, that she was going to be fine.”</p>



<p>Orlando is home to about 280,000 residents, plus many more temporary guests. Each year, some 50 million travelers pass through the city’s airport, the busiest in the Sunshine State. Six-lane highways crisscross to speed tourists to Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World and other nearby theme parks. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Ana Cruz" class="wp-image-3087545" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050920_cg_destinations_inline2_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087545">In October 2017, Ana Cruz (left) of Orlando’s Hispanic Office for Local Assistance greeted Puerto Ricans fleeing Hurricane Maria’s destruction.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087545">HOLA</span></figure>



<p>But nothing like the 2017 rush of climate refugees had happened there before. Orlando and neighboring cities in central Florida groaned under the weight of so many new people in such a short time. The city’s massive tourism industry turned out to be a silver lining, Castro says, with jobs and housing available, at least for the short term, in the region’s many hotels. In a two-week period after Maria, every hotel room in the area was full.</p>



<p>City and emergency managers scrambled to find longer-term affordable housing, transportation, health care and other social services for the new residents. Teachers had to be hired, especially those who speak Spanish. An assistance center to help newcomers from hurricane-ravaged regions also opened in Kissimmee, half an hour’s drive south. </p>



<p>Today, two and a half years later, perhaps a tenth of the estimated 250,000 climate migrants remain, Castro says. The rest returned to their homes in Puerto Rico, or sought some other safe haven. </p>



<p>But for Castro and other city managers in Orlando, the experience was transformative. </p>



<p>In 2019, the city kicked off an array of projects and partnerships to improve its resilience and plan for future climate migration booms. Among its partners is the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council, which represents eight counties, including Orlando’s Orange County. Jenifer Rupert, in charge of the council’s resilience efforts, says that Maria was a wake-up call for her organization, too. “I thought … we really need to get better at the way we’re handling this.”</p>



<p>In addition to hurricane-related migrations, Rupert says, the council is concerned about waves of migrations as sea levels continue to rise. “What are we going to do when the state of Florida starts losing coastline, and people from Miami come up here?” Rupert asks. “What are we really putting in place now to start managing those types of numbers?” </p>

<h4>Deciding on a destination</h4>



<p>One might expect U.S. climate migrants to choose “climate beneficial” locations — cool, temperate places, such as Minneapolis or Seattle, rather than Florida or Texas, says Jina, the Chicago economist. “It seems counterintuitive: Instead of moving to more resilient cities, they’re moving to a city that can only really be livable in the future if you can afford air conditioning.”</p>



<p>But other factors tend to weigh more heavily in migration decisions: available jobs, health care, family and community, says Mathew Hauer, a sociologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “Most migration tends to be short-distance, for economic and social reasons, like a better-paying job.” </p>

<h3>Moving on </h3>



<p>A 2017 study projected 10 U.S. regions as the most likely destinations for people fleeing sea level rise by 2100. The top three areas could each see population booms of more than 250,000.</p>

<p>Take Orlando. It’s located in a state that is squarely in the path of rising seas and has seen record-breaking heat in the last year. But Orlando satisfies many of the other needs of possible climate migrants, at least in the short term. It is in the center of the state, far enough from the worst effects of possible storm surges and sunny-day flooding due to rising sea levels. It has jobs. And it has made an effort to be welcoming to migrants.</p>



<p>Taking a holistic look at what drives migration is known as “migration systems theory.” Using that approach, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3271">a study reported in 2017 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em></a>, Hauer identified 10 likely “climate destination” regions in the United States for the estimated 13.1 million people within the country who are expected to be displaced by rising sea levels by 2100. Based on his simulations, the top destinations include Austin, Orlando and Atlanta. </p>



<p>Hauer’s study was the first to attempt to anticipate destination regions for U.S. climate migrants. He tracked large-scale, county-to-county migrations of people from 1990 to 2013 using annual tax data from the IRS. Then, based on observed patterns, which reveal residents’ past choices, he projected where people are likely to go in the future. </p>



<p>Economists have used similar factors to create econometric models to forecast changes in populations. Such simulations can help local governments assess the need for everything from additional housing and transportation to shifting school district boundaries. </p>



<p>That approach has been around for a long time, and when it comes to simulating climate-related migrations, “it works to a certain extent,” says Vivek Shandas, an urban planning researcher at Portland State University in Oregon. But more accurate simulations of widespread climate migration should consider one more dimension of the decision-making process, he says: how people might decide when it’s time to leave.</p>



<h4>Making the call</h4>



<p>That decision will likely be different depending on the type of climate trigger, Shandas says. A growing field of research called event ecology uses computer models to anticipate how an extreme event, such as a hurricane, might ripple through a community, altering population numbers and infrastructure. Those kinds of events — sudden, short-term and extreme, such as Katrina in 2005 — are called “pulse events.” </p>



<p>Migrations spurred by pulse events are fairly easy to simulate. There’s one point of origin, and scientists can make knowledgeable guesses about where people might go from that point of origin based on proximity to other cities, family connections and job availability. Pulse event migrations also tend to occur shortly after the triggering event. </p>



<p>But ongoing climate change can boost the frequency of pulse events. For example, climate change is increasing the risk of deadly and destructive wildfires, such as those that struck California in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Each event may trigger some migration, but over time those who stayed behind may also begin to wonder whether they, too, should move to a safer haven. </p>



<p>Such slower, longer-term manifestations of climate change, or “press events,” can be more challenging when it comes to anticipating both when and where people may choose to move. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">Rising sea levels are the textbook example</a> of a press event (<em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 18</em>). And it’s with these events that people’s different risk tolerances most come into play. </p>



<p>“There are different thresholds that people are willing to put up with,” Hauer says. “For some, [that threshold comes] much sooner than when there’s water at the doorstep.” Many people will face the dire choice between individual migration, community-based movement away from the risk, known as “managed retreat,” or even deciding to find ways to stay in place. </p>



<p>There’s no template for what will happen in response to widespread sea level rise, which will affect many different places at once. “We haven’t yet lived in a world with high tide flooding multiple days a month,” Jina says. “It will change housing prices, as well as whether or not people reinforce coasts.”</p>





<p>Hauer notes that his destination city study, published in April 2017, came just a few months before Hurricane Harvey poured torrents of rain onto southeastern Texas, including Houston. Does that event push Houston off the future destinations list? Not necessarily, he says. Post-Harvey resilience efforts in Houston can alter the calculus. </p>



<p>And there are many other lingering unknowns when it comes to assessing people’s decisions. “We know very little about how different age groups would respond to different stimuli,” Hauer says. “Or how different climate impacts will interact with each other, [such as] how migration to Atlanta might affect migration to Miami.”</p>



<h4>Seeking urban resilience in Orlando</h4>



<p>Despite these challenges, climate migration is “something that we have to face,” says Yue “Gurt” Ge, an expert in risk and resilience management at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Finding some way to assess the scale of the issue will be essential to creating climate adaptation strategies for his city, he says. </p>



<p>It’s 3 p.m. in late February 2020, and the university’s new Urban Resilience team is holding its second meeting in a brand-new, glossy high-rise in downtown Orlando. This interdisciplinary team is the brainchild of Ge and emergency management expert Naim Kapucu, head of the university’s school of public administration.</p>



<p>Ge, a slight, energetic man, eagerly ushers a group of about a dozen waiting scientists into the conference room, where they sit at long white tables and introduce themselves. Half a dozen more people are Skyping in. It’s a diverse group, with expertise in everything from artificial intelligence to wine. Resilience, reducing the impact of disasters, is the common link. </p>



<p>Ge is anxious to build connections within the team. Periodically, he steps in, noting how each person is connected to the larger effort. Interdisciplinary teams have insights, he says. Perhaps as important, they get funding. He says he hopes to identify research projects for the team, as well as build partnerships to better implement best practices.</p>



<p>First on the table might be developing a formal, research-driven way to count climate migrations to Orlando — a necessary ingredient for any city’s resilience plan. “We can contribute by proposing scientific studies, surveys, focus groups with climate refugees,” Ge says. The airport, local community organizations and shelters could be helpful in providing data. HOLA, he says, is a valuable ally in this effort as well. “When they accommodate or house these people, then they do have some numbers to tell us.”</p>



<p>Finding good data to track migration remains a challenge. The IRS changed the way it records tax data in 2017, unfortunately “breaking” the time series that Hauer had previously used, he says. Those data also are collected annually, giving only a long-term picture of migrations. That’s also true of, for example, data on state-to-state migrations and changes to the workforce collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>



<p>For one measure of short-term movement, the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College at the City University of New York used student enrollment data from state departments of education to show that<a href="https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/PDF/Schoolenroll-v2-3-3-2018.pdf"> many Florida counties saw a rise in Puerto Rican enrollees</a> between December 2017 and February 2018, months after the hurricane. Overall, Florida saw a 12 percent increase, to 11,554 students from Puerto Rico enrolled in schools. Other states that saw rises included New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">

<p>Based on school enrollment data from the state department of education, Florida’s Orange County, home to Orlando (white star), took in the most students from Puerto Rico in early 2018, after Hurricane Maria. The top six counties are shown. </p>

<p>Social media, including Facebook and Twitter, may also be useful for tracking large-scale migrations due to climate events that occur on short timescales. Yago Martín, who studies urban resilience at UCF, and colleagues devised a way to use geotagged tweets to identify and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-020-00338-6">track movements of over a thousand Puerto Rican residents in Maria’s aftermath</a>. The methodology holds promise for tracking future migrations, the team reported in February in <em>Population and Environment</em>. </p>



<p>The good news is that large research institutions are beginning to recognize the need to fund climate migration research, says UCF sociologist Fernando Rivera, who heads the university’s Puerto Rico Research Hub. He is gearing up to embark on a National Academy of Sciences–funded analysis of past and present climate migrations, focusing on changes in housing markets, financial services, health care, employment and economic development in the communities where migrants end up. </p>



<p>The study zooms in on three migration events: from Puerto Rico to Orlando in 2017; New Orleans to Houston in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina; and the pending resettlement of the few dozen residents of Isle de Jean Charles, one of Louisiana’s coastal islands about to be drowned by rising seas. The goal, Rivera says, is to try to determine lessons for future destination communities, such as Orlando. </p>



<h4>New home</h4>



<p>Vila and her 10 family members moved together from hotel room to hotel room for several weeks after arriving in Orlando, unable to find permanent housing. Although they were able, barely, to afford the costs of this lifestyle, other Puerto Rican migrants were not so lucky. Monthly allowances for temporary housing provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to Maria evacuees dried up after about a year for many families. </p>



<p>Eventually, most of Vila’s family returned to Puerto Rico. But she and her husband and their children stayed, deciding that the quality of life for their children would ultimately be better on the mainland. She and her husband found jobs: Her husband works in maintenance at their apartment complex. Vila worked at Disney World as a hostess until the parks closed due to social distancing restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic. She recently completed coursework to become a medical assistant, graduating with high grades. </p>



<p>It’s modest success, but Vila says she doesn’t feel quite at home. Still, she says she has no plans to leave. For one thing, her son is now doing very well. And life, she adds, is “peaceful.” </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Dreams of Buffalo</h3>



<p>In 2017, climate scientist Stephen Vermette of Buffalo State College in New York analyzed recent climate trends for the western part of the state to help the region begin its own resilience planning. Using data going back to 1965, he looked for trends in heat waves, warmer summers, precipitation and other possible signs of climate change.</p>



<p>To his surprise, Vermette says, none of those signs appeared in his analysis. In the future, western New York may “fare better than other parts of the country.” He suspects that this is due to the nearby Great Lakes, which may exert a cooling effect on the region during future summers.</p>



<p>He hasn’t been able to simulate future lake effects on the region’s climate, but his findings drew media attention. Local and national press touted the possibility that Buffalo could become a climate refuge. In particular, Buffalo and other cities that are less affected by, for example, rising seas, may become particularly attractive to businesses that are looking for a stable place to thrive far into the future. </p>



<p>“Investors or the high-tech industry, versus people who just need to get out of the way of a hurricane — those are very different scenarios,” says urban planning researcher Vivek Shandas of Portland State University in Oregon. “I’ve had investment bankers say to me, ‘Santa Barbara is burning, Martha’s Vineyard is going underwater … where do I invest money right now?’ ” </p>



<p>Vermette says that he hopes Buffalo city officials will embrace the idea of a climate refuge future. “Buffalo could position itself to take advantage of its situation,” he says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-symptoms-signs-loss-smell-taste">Loss of smell and taste may actually be one of the clearest signs of COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>A loss of smell and taste may be one of
the clearest indicators of whether someone has COVID-19, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Researchers gleaned the information from
nearly 2.5 million people in the United Kingdom and about 170,000 people in the
United States who entered whether they were feeling well or experiencing symptoms
into a smartphone app from March 24 to April 21. </p>



<p>Some of the app users also reported
results of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states">PCR
diagnostic tests</a> for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (<em>SN: 3/6/20</em>). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2">Nearly 65 percent</a>
of roughly 6,400 U.K. residents who tested positive for the virus described a
loss of taste and smell as a symptom, researchers report May 11 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. And just over 67
percent of the 726 U.S. participants with a positive test also reported losing
those senses. Only about 20 percent of all people who tested negative had
diminished smell and taste.</p>

<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>

</aside>





<p>Using data from the app, a team of scientists led by clinical researchers Claire Steves and Tim Spector, both of King’s College London, devised a formula for determining which symptoms best predict COVID-19. A combination of loss of taste and smell, extreme fatigue, cough and loss of appetite was the best predictor of having a positive result from the PCR test, the team found. Based on those symptoms, the researchers estimate that more than 140,000 of the more than 800,000 app users who reported symptoms probably have COVID-19. </p>



<p>The World Health Organization lists loss of taste and smell as <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3">a less common COVID-19 symptom</a>. But the new findings suggest that it should be added to the list of top symptoms used to screen people for the disease, the researchers say. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-liquid-salty-brine-simulation-cold-life">Salty water might exist on Mars, but it’s probably too cold for life</a></h4>

<p>Liquid brine can hang around on Mars’ surface, a new study suggests,
but conditions may not be great for life as we know it. </p>



<p>That’s bad news for any Earth-based microorganisms determined
to colonize the Red Planet, but good news for humans who don’t want to
contaminate Mars with microbes hitching a ride on robot explorers.</p>



<p>Pure liquid water can’t last on Mars’ frigid surface. But
mix in some salts, and H<sub>2</sub>O might stick around for a bit. NASA’s
Curiosity and Phoenix landers have detected salts known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brines-mars">perchlorates</a> in the
Martian soil, and researchers have suggested that such salts might make
transient brines possible (<em>SN: 3/20/09</em>).
</p>



<p>No salty liquid water has been definitively found on Mars.
But there have been hints of water <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/salt-streaks-point-present-day-water-flows-mars">dribbling
out from underground</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/15</em>),
and a controversial report of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-ice-lake-top-science-stories-2018-yir">a
buried lake</a> near the Red Planet’s south pole (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). </p>



<p>To learn more about how brines would behave in contemporary
Martian conditions, Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a planetary scientist at the Lunar and
Planetary Institute in Houston, and colleagues ran computer simulations. They
found that one type of brine could remain liquid on the planet’s surface and a
few centimeters below for up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1080-9">six consecutive hours
across 40 percent of the planet</a>, mostly at middle to high northern
latitudes. However, those brines would never get warmer than about –48° Celsius, about 25 degrees below the
known tolerance for life on Earth, the team reports online May 11 in <em>Nature
Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>This finding is useful for anyone planning a mission to
Mars, the researchers say. Expeditions to locales with the potential for liquid
water are subject <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-rules-guarding-other-planets-contamination-may-be-too-strict">to
strict protection protocols</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/19</em>) to reduce the risk of
contamination from Earth. If Martian brines are truly uninhabitable by any
known organism from our planet, that may ease restrictions on future
exploration. </p>

<p>A tooth and six bone fragments found in a Bulgarian cave are
the oldest directly dated remains of <em>Homo
sapiens</em> in Europe, scientists say. </p>



<p>Until now, most of the earliest fossils of humans on the
continent ranged in age from around 45,000 to 41,500 years old. But those ages are
based on dates for sediment and artifacts associated with the fossils, not the
fossils themselves. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2259-z">newfound remains</a>
date to between roughly 46,000 and 44,000 years ago, researchers report May 11
in <em>Nature</em>. </p>



<p>A previous report of the earliest human fossil in Europe
centered on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greek-skull-oldest-human-homo-sapiens-outside-africa">a
skull fragment from what’s now Greece</a> (<em>SN:
7/10/19</em>). That fossil may date to at least 210,000 years ago, which would
make it the oldest by far, but the dating and species identification of that
find are controversial. </p>



<p>The new discoveries at Bulgaria’s Bacho Kiro Cave have added
evidence for a scenario in which African <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israeli-fossil-may-recast-history-first-europeans"><em>H. sapiens</em> reached the Middle East</a> approximately
50,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/28/15</em>) and
then rapidly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-entry-europe-pushed-earlier">dispersed
into Europe</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/11</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-human-dna-narrows-time-neandertal-hookups">Central
Asia</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/14</em>), the
scientists conclude. </p>





<p>Except for the tooth, the new <em>H. sapiens</em> fossils were too fragmentary to identify by their
appearance. But researchers could extract proteins from the fossils. An
analysis of how the proteins’ building blocks were arranged, which can
distinguish between various animal species, pegged them as human, say
paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and colleagues. Mitochondrial
DNA, typically inherited from the mother, obtained from six of the seven <em>H. sapiens</em> fossils also identified the fossils
as human.</p>



<p>A second study by many of the same researchers and led by
Max Planck archaeologist Helen Fewlass reports <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1136-3">estimated ages of the
Bacho Kiro finds</a>. Radiocarbon dates of the fossils and age calculations for
recovered mitochondrial DNA, based on comparisons to ancient and present-day
people’s mitochondrial DNA, consistently put the finds at between around 46,000
and 44,000 years old, the researchers report May 11 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.  </p>

Hublin et al/<em>Nature </em>2020</span></figure>



<p>What’s more, stone artifacts and personal ornaments found
with the human fossils are the earliest examples of a shift in tool and ornament
making from what’s known as the Initial Upper Paleolithic culture, Hublin and
colleagues say. Along with several earlier European excavations, the new finds
indicate that Initial Upper Paleolithic tools were made for only a few thousand
years before being replaced by related implements from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/telling-stories-stone-tools">the
Aurignacian culture</a>, which dates to between 43,000 and 33,000 years ago (<em>SN: 3/23/15</em>).</p>



<p>The newfound stone tools and pendants made from cave bear
teeth appear to have inspired similar objects made a few thousand years later
by western European Neandertals, Hublin says, suggesting that ancient humans in
Bulgaria mingled with native Neandertals. “The Bacho Kiro cave provides
evidence that pioneer groups of <em>Homo
sapiens</em> brought new behaviors into Europe and interacted with local
Neandertals,” Hublin says. </p>



<p>Although that’s possible, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cache-eagle-claws-points-neandertal-jewelry-making">Neandertals
made jewelry out of eagle talons</a> around 130,000 years ago (<em>SN: 3/20/15</em>). That’s long before when <em>H. sapiens</em> are generally thought to have
first reached Europe, and thus Neandertals may not have been influenced by the
newcomers’ ornaments, says paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of the Natural
History Museum in London, who did not participate in the new studies.</p>



<p>Human groups that brought Initial Upper Paleolithic
toolmaking to Europe may have been too small to stay or survive for long when
confronted with larger numbers of Neandertals and frequent climate fluctuations
at the time, Stringer suspects. For as yet unclear reasons, it was the Aurignacian
toolmakers who first took root in Europe and witnessed “a physical but not
genetic end” to Neandertals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-and-neandertals-mated-more-recently-thought">some
of whose DNA survived in <em>H. sapiens</em></a>
as a result of previous interbreeding, he says (<em>SN: 5/11/15</em>).</p>



<p>Bacho Kiro discoveries fill in the picture of where <em>H. sapiens</em> were located in southeastern
Europe during a period already known to have included interbreeding between
humans and Neandertals, says archaeologist Paul Pettitt of Durham University in
England, who was not part of Hublin’s team. Like Stringer, Pettitt suspects
ancient humans’ stay at Bacho Kiro “was brief and ultimately a failure.”</p>



<p>More than 11,000 animal bone fragments also unearthed at Bacho Kiro come from 23 species, including bison, red deer, cave bears and goats. Some bones displayed stone tool marks made during butchery and skinning of animals, as well as intentional breaks where marrow was removed, the researchers say.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When my 9-year-old has his best friend over to play, the house is filled with the sound of giggles. Yes, this friend plays fair, is outgoing and shares my son’s interests. But he’s also good <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Any parent knows that kids this age are obsessed with having fun (something that’s in short supply for many home-schoolers right now). And yet “being fun” has been overlooked as an indicator of a child’s social status, argue the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12546">new paper</a>, published in the <em>International Journal of Psychology</em>. Their new studies are, they say, the first to establish it as a unique factor important for understanding social hierarchies among kids.</p>
<p><span id="more-39593"></span>Within groups of children, social status is fluid, note Brett Laursen at Florida Atlantic University and colleagues. So far, researchers have identified and studied two factors that are the main drivers of a child’s potentially fluctuating status: likeability and popularity.</p>
<p>There is some overlap between the two. Both involve being outgoing and prosocial, for instance. But there are also some differences. For example, a popular kid <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/">might sometimes be physically aggressive</a>. This can raise their social status while reducing their likeability.</p>
<p>However, being “fun to be with” is conspicuously missing from the list of traits associated with being well-liked or popular, the authors argue. And yet, as they note, having fun is not only intrinsically socially rewarding but could bring other benefits — fun experiences promote creativity, and being perceived as fun could protect a child from peer rejection.</p>
<p>To investigate this, the team devised two studies. The first was conducted on 611 school kids aged 9 to 12 in Colombia. These children were asked to identify up to four same-sex classmates who best fit descriptions of likeability, popularity, and also fun. (Fun was measured with two items: “It is fun to hang out with him/her” and “Someone you can have fun with at a party”.)</p>
<p>The children also named classmates who they thought best fit seven other categories: academic achievement, athleticism, justice (fairness), leadership, physical aggression, prosocial behaviour (eg. being compassionate and caring for others) and relational aggression.  These variables are known to correlate with likeablility and popularity, and the team thought they could potentially also correlate with fun.</p>
<p>The results showed positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity: children who received more likeability nominations, for example, also tended to receive more nominations for being fun and popular. These variables were also positively correlated with all the potential confounding variables, except physical and/or relational aggression, depending on the age group.</p>
<p>The researchers then turned to 662 children of the same ages at two schools in southern Florida, who completed a similar peer-nomination questionnaire to the previous study. To look at changes over time, the team also asked the kids to complete the task again eight weeks later. (Eight weeks might sound like a short period of time to adults, but, at more than half a typical UK term, it’s a substantial amount of time for a kid, the team argues.)</p>
<p>Again, there were positive correlations between fun, likeability and popularity. But the team also found that being perceived as fun at the first time point predicted increases in popularity and likeability eight weeks later: higher initial fun ratings were linked to bigger increases in both these other measures.</p>
<p>In their statistical analysis, the team removed the contribution of the variables already known to influence likeability and popularity (such as pro-social behaviour, leadership, physical attractiveness and relational aggression). And they found that the associations between initial fun ratings and later changes in status remained. Being perceived as fun, then, seems to act an independent factor contributing to social status.</p>
<p>Laursen and colleagues also found that higher likeability and popularity scores at the first time point were linked to higher fun scores at the second, “suggesting that, in the eyes of peers, fun begets status and status begets fun”.</p>
<p>The study didn’t explore what makes for a fun kid. But the team suggests that such children are equipped with a “constellation of traits”. They are likely socially adept and benefit from “ego resilience” (characterised by high levels of extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low neuroticism). They’re also probably enthusiastic and excitable, but able to regulate these traits.</p>
<p>The team would now like to see much more work to explore “being fun”. “Anecdotally, we know that children are intensely focused on having fun,” they write. “Scholars should be similarly focused on understanding the contributions of fun to success in the peer social world.”</p>

A group of researchers in Scotland have taken aim at a study published in early March which reported surprising findings on the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.  But the story of what it took to correct the record about the paper is likely to be all too familiar to those … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/11/aggressive-covid-19-strains-what-it-takes-to-correct-a-flawed-paper/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">‘Aggressive’ COVID-19 strains: What it takes to correct a flawed paper</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-michael-moore-new-film-gets-wrong-about-renewable-energy">What Michael Moore’s new film gets wrong about renewable energy</a></h4>

<p>In the film <a href="https://planetofthehumans.com/"><em>Planet
of the Humans</em></a>, producer and
director Jeff Gibbs and executive producer Michael Moore take aim at renewable
energy technologies and the environmental organizations such as 350.org and the
Sierra Club that promote them. The film’s premise is that green tech is not so
green and that turning to this technology as a cure for climate change would be
worse than the disease. </p>



<p>Scientists and environmental
activists have <a href="https://sierraclub.bc.ca/sierra-club-bc-response-to-planet-of-the-humans/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=sierra-club-bc-response-to-planet-of-the-humans">already</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/bill-mckibben-climate-movement-michael-moore-993073/">disputed</a>
many of <a href="https://ketanjoshi.co/2020/04/24/planet-of-the-humans-a-reheated-mess-of-lazy-old-myths/">the assertions</a> in the movie, which was released on YouTube on April 21. One commonly cited problem
is that the film’s renewable energy claims are often a decade out of date —
ancient in green tech years — and misleading. Here’s a closer look at five of
those claims.</p>



<h4>Making solar cells is not environmentally friendly.</h4>



<p>As the film notes, traditional
photovoltaic solar cells are made with high-grade, extremely pure silicon,
gleaned from quartz mined from mountains and then melted at very, very high
temperatures. That takes a lot of energy, which may be generated from coal or
other fossil fuels, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greener-green-energy-todays-solar-cells-give-more-they-take">therefore releasing climate-warming carbon emissions</a> (<em>SN: 2/27/08</em>). </p>





<p>Solar cell manufacturing
also creates environmentally harmful by-products, such as liquid silicon
tetrachloride. Tetrachloride can be recycled, but if released into the
environment, it can react with water to form hydrochloric acid. However,
researchers are investigating alternatives to using chlorine-based compounds
during manufacturing, which would eliminate tetrachloride as a by-product.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, solar cell
technology is advancing rapidly. Thin-film solar cells involve layers of
light-absorbing semiconductors such as cadmium telluride or copper indium gallium
selenide that are deposited on glass, metal or plastic. This technology uses
only a fraction of the silicon needed to make the thick silicon wafers of a
standard photovoltaic cell. Thin-film cells also eliminate the use of dangerous
hydrofluoric acid to clean the wafers. </p>



<p>Although industry uses some
thin-film cells, they are generally too pricey to be appealing for widespread
use. But there’s a promising thin-film prospect on the horizon, which uses a
coating of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">a light-absorbing material called perovskite</a> (<em>SN: 7/26/17</em>). As <em>Nature</em> reported in
2019, right now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01985-y">the race is on</a>
to make perovskite solar cells cheap enough to be commercially viable. </p>



<h4>Solar cells are really inefficient.</h4>



<p>In one memorable scene,
Gibbs visits the Cedar Street Solar Array in Lansing, Mich. A representative
from the Lansing Board of Water and Light tells him that the array’s solar
cells have less than 8 percent efficiency (the amount of generated energy
relative to the incoming solar energy). The utility has roughly 800 solar
panels in the array, which can power maybe 10 houses for a year, he says. </p>



<p>That plant, however, was
installed in 2008, which is multiple generations ago in solar cell technology
time. Efficiencies for standard photovoltaics are much higher now, hovering
close to 20 percent. Perovskite solar cells push that efficiency even higher,
up to 25 percent. And by creating “tandem” solar cells that layer perovskite on
top of silicon, manufacturers can maximize the ability of the cells to absorb
light in different parts of the spectrum, increasing the efficiency still
further.</p>

<h4>Solar cells and wind turbines have such short life spans that manufacturing replacements uses up more fossil fuels than the renewable energies save.</h4>



<p><em>Planet of the Humans</em> suggests that the carbon emissions released from the
energy involved in manufacturing new parts and machinery for wind and solar
power are greater than any saved emissions from the facilities. “You use more
fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it,” says Ozzie Zehner,
one of the movie’s producers. “You would have been better off burning the
fossil fuels in the first place instead of playing pretend.” </p>



<p>But that statement <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html">isn’t supported by data</a>. For example, the film claims that “some solar
panels” last only 10 years, but today’s solar panels are built to last 20 to 30
years. Similarly, wind turbines have a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=33632">life span of about 20 to 25 years</a>, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. </p>



<p>A 2017 study in <em>Nature
Energy</em> reported that the lifetime <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-017-0032-9">carbon footprints of solar, wind and nuclear energy</a> power plants are just a fraction of the lifetime
footprints of coal and natural gas plants. The study also projects that, in
2050, the energy involved in constructing and operating a solar or wind power
plant will be just 3 to 8 percent of its electricity output. </p>



<h4>Solar and wind power are too intermittent to ever fully replace fossil fuels.</h4>



<p>The question of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-batteries-charge-forward">storing energy</a>
generated by renewables so it’s available when the sun isn’t shining or the
wind isn’t blowing has dogged renewables for decades (<em>SN: 1/9/17</em>). But battery
storage does exist: Some renewable companies use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">lithium-ion batteries</a>, for example (<em>SN: 5/7/19</em>). And renewable
energy utilities in the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan and elsewhere <a href="https://www.irena.org/newsroom/articles/2020/Mar/Battery-storage-paves-way-for-a-renewable-powered-future">use battery storage systems</a>, though so far they are primarily for short-term
storage, amounting to a few hours. </p>



<p>In the film, Gibbs suggests
that battery storage capacity — how much energy the batteries can store — is the
main obstacle to updating the traditional energy grid. He shows a pie chart
apparently based on data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency,
which he says shows that current total battery storage capacity is 51 trillion
British thermal units. That’s “less than one-tenth of 1 percent of what’s
needed” for a year’s worth of energy usage around the globe. </p>



<p>The problem with that
argument is that it’s a false premise: To integrate renewables into the grid,
it’s not necessary to have enough capacity to match peak global demand —
meaning, all of the world’s global energy needs, all at the same time. Instead,
as energy writer Ketan Joshi noted on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1206141940707790850">an optimized mix</a> of different renewable technologies (and some storage) can work
together to keep the lights on. </p>



<p>Rather than capacity, the real
obstacle to utility-scale energy storage is price. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30300-9">2019 study in <em>Joule</em></a> noted that for wind and solar power to completely
power the United States, energy storage would need to be highly
cost-competitive, with a maximum price tag of just $20 per kilowatt-hour, about
90 percent cheaper than it currently is. The materials in lithium-ion batteries
are too expensive to hit that target, but researchers are developing other
battery materials, such as sodium sulfur and sodium nickel chloride, that could
be much cheaper. </p>





<h4>Replacing coal plants with natural gas plants isn’t an improvement. </h4>



<p>Across the United States,
utilities have been moving away from coal — partly due to costly environmental regulations
and partly due to increasing competition from other sources of electricity. As
a result, many energy giants, such as Duke Energy, say they are replacing these
coal plants with clean energy sources. As <em>Planet of the Humans</em> correctly
notes, this very often means a replacement with another type of fossil fuel:
natural gas. </p>



<p>By around 2016, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">natural gas replaced coal</a> as the leading source of electrical power in the
United States, according to the EIA. In 2019, natural gas provided about 38
percent of the nation’s electricity compared with coal’s roughly 24 percent. </p>



<p>The movie suggests that
companies are greenwashing this shift by calling these natural gas power plants
clean. Sure. The movie also suggests that environmental groups such as the
Sierra Club, which has led the charge to retire U.S. coal-fired power plants,
are equally culpable for not making the distinction between natural gas and
renewable energies when talking about clean energy. This is demonstrably <a href="https://mountaintrue.org/file-to-intervene/">untrue</a>. </p>



<p>Bottom line, natural gas
isn’t clean, but it is cleaner than coal. Natural gas emits <a href="https://ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-natural-gas">as little as 50 to 60 percent</a> of the carbon dioxide of a coal plant. Coal burning also
adds toxic heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic to the atmosphere and to
waterways, not to mention the polluted waterways and denuded mountaintops that
come with coal mining. For these reasons, eliminating coal has been (and should
be) a top priority for environmental activists. </p>



<p>But it’s fair to say that natural
gas has some problems (oddly <em>not</em> ones discussed in the movie), and
there’s good reason to be cautious. About <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34732">two-thirds</a> of new U.S. oil and gas wells are using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/facts-behind-frack">hydraulic fracturing</a>, breaking apart shale and other rocks deep underground to extract the
gas (<em>SN: 8/24/12</em>). Fracking has a host of possible hazardous
consequences, not least its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volume-fracking-fluid-pumped-underground-tied-canada-quakes">link to earthquakes</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/18</em>). Moreover, natural gas plants can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">leak large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane</a> to the atmosphere due to faulty infrastructure as
well as venting (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). </p>



<p>By pointing out problems, Gibbs
and Moore have said that they just wanted <em>Planet of the Humans </em>to start a conversation about the
renewable energy industry. Indeed, the film poses many questions about the
industry and the environmental groups that advocate for it. But the film offers
no alternative solutions (it hints that perhaps there are just too many people
on the planet for any sustainable solution but stops short of advocating for
outright population control).</p>



<p>This “just asking questions” trope is another way that the movie feels out of date. As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">last year’s climate protests</a> revealed, people don’t need this movie to spur them to outrage or activism (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). They’re already there. And they definitely don’t need bad or incomplete information with which to combat the climate crisis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florence-nightingale-birthday-power-visualizing-science">Florence Nightingale understood the power of visualizing science</a></h4>

<p>Victorian
icon Florence Nightingale is best known as the founder of modern nursing. But
Nightingale, who would have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-science-anniversaries-2020">celebrated
her 200th birthday</a> on May 12, was also a statistics and data visualization
pioneer who sought to illustrate that simple sanitation techniques, such as
handwashing, could stop the spread of infectious diseases (<em>SN: 1/5/20</em>). While that’s a particularly timely message given the ongoing
coronavirus pandemic, it wasn’t one widely known, or even believed, in the
mid-1800s.</p>



<p>Nightingale’s
<a href="https://archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond/page/n3/mode/2up">best-known
diagram</a> is a variation of a pie chart known as a rose, or polar area,
chart. In that diagram, she showed that poor sanitation, not battle wounds, lay
behind most English soldiers’ deaths during the Crimean War in the 1850s and
that such deaths were avoidable, says statistics historian Eileen Magnello of
University College London. It “provided unequivocal evidential data that
preventable contagious diseases could be eliminated.”</p>





<p>To
make the graph, Nightingale used data she and medical staff collected while
caring for English soldiers in army hospitals and camps. She observed the
soldiers’ horrific living conditions — dirty linens, clothes infested with lice
and fleas, and rats hiding under the beds. Far more soldiers, she realized,
were dying of diseases, such as cholera, typhus and dysentery, than battle wounds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Crimean War rose diagram" class="wp-image-3087834" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050920_scivi_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087834">Nightingale’s most famous data visualization shows how many more English soldiers were dying of cholera and other preventable diseases (blue) than battle wounds (red) during the Crimean War. (Black is all other causes of death.) Each wedge represents a month.

The left chart shows how simple public health measures save lives.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087834">WELLCOME COLLECTION (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>)</span></figure>



<p>That
graph wasn’t Nightingale’s only attempt at data visualization: She made a series
of other charts to help convince the general public, medical staff and
lawmakers that sanitation saves lives. </p>



<p>In
one example, Nightingale showed that soldiers were much more likely to die of
preventable diseases than male civilians, even during peacetime. She used a bar
chart to show that soldiers, even during peacetime, were dying at roughly
double the rate of civilians, due to especially bad sanitation in English
barracks. </p>



<p>Nightingale
was incensed by her finding, writing in 1857: “[I]t is as criminal to have a
mortality of 17, 19 and 20 per 1,000 in the Line Artillery and Guards in
England when that of civil life in towns is only 11 per 1, 000 as it would be
to take 1,100 men per [year] out upon Salisbury Plain and shoot them.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Peacetime mortality rate bar chart" class="wp-image-3087833" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050920_scivi_inline2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087833">Here, Nightingale uses a bar chart to compare the mortality rate during peacetime of male English civilians (black bars) with English soldiers (red) in four age groups.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087833">ELMER BELT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE COLLECTION/UNIV. OF CALIFORNIA LIBRARIES/ARCHIVE.ORG</span></figure>



<p>Other
“bat’s wing” diagrams were precursors to the rose charts. In one example, Nightingale
compares causes of English soldiers’ deaths during the Crimean War from April
1854 to March 1855 by month with deaths from April 1855 to March 1856. These
diagrams were meant to show that sanitation efforts implemented in army camps
and hospitals during the war dramatically cut soldiers’ deaths. The length of
each radial line is proportional to the death rate for that month, with a large
spike in deaths in January 1855. </p>



<p>But
the text accompanying the diagrams suggested the shaded areas, not the radial
lines, correspond to the death rate. Nightingale put an erratum on the figure
and stopped using it, showing she arrived at her iconic rose chart through
trial and, even, error.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bat’s wing diagram" class="wp-image-3087832" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050920_scivi_inline3.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087832">These “bat’s wing” diagrams, precursors to the rose charts, compare causes of English soldiers’ deaths during the Crimean War from April 1854 to March 1855 by month (right) with deaths from April 1855 to March 1856 (left). Green represents preventable deaths due to disease, red is wounds and gray is all other causes. The length of each radial line is proportional to the death rate for that month, with a big spike in deaths in January 1855.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087832">ELMER BELT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE COLLECTION/UNIV. OF CALIFORNIA LIBRARIES/ARCHIVE.ORG</span></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Nightingale’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florence-nightingale-passionate-statistician">ideas
around sanitation</a> began to permeate public consciousness (<em>SN: 11/26/08</em>). Patients at military and
civilian hospitals started receiving bedpans, access to fresh air and clean bed
linens and bowls for eating. She later turned her attention to the health of
soldiers in India. That work led to similar health and sanitation reforms in
those overseas military barracks and improved sanitation, such as clean water supplies,
in various locales around the country.    
</p>



<p>Visualizations became one of Nightingale’s preferred ways of communicating about the need for sanitary reforms to save lives, a sentiment she herself expressed in a letter dated August 1857: “Whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new diagram.”  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></h4>

<p>“You never write…you never call….” The guilt-tripping mother is common stereotype in movies and TV. But how many adult children harbor feelings of guilt toward their aging parents? Who experiences this guilt, and why?</p><p>About one in five adult children experience feelings of guilt toward their ageing mothers, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 2,450 Dutch adults in 2015 who have a mother aged 55 or older. Feelings of guilt in the family have rarely been measured in a systematic fashion but researchers have long argued that guilt is not only something moral, but also a fundamental social emotion. Guilt refers to negative feelings that arise from having done something that is – or is perceived to be – wrong. Guilt is not the same as shame; guilt is the awareness that one has done something wrong, shame is the translation of that feeling to one’s self-image: the feeling of not being a good person. Guilt and shame are emotions that have been linked to depression and low self-esteem.</p><p>People who have negative feelings about their relationships with their mothers more often report feelings of guilt. Surprisingly, people who have both negative and positive feelings about their mothers have more guilt. This may be because children who have negative feelings about their mothers are afraid that this will hurt their mothers’ feelings. This fear of hurting a person is more difficult if one also cares about that other person. Most people have positive feelings about their mothers. However, cultural expectations about positive and warm relationships with mothers leave little room for irritation, anger, and embarrassment, and it is exactly when such feelings arise in a warm relationship that people may feel guilty.</p><p>Adult children are an important source of support for their ageing parents. However, even at older ages, parents continue to support their adult children. The flow of support does not necessarily shift from downward (from parents to children) to upward (from children to parents) with age and for that reason, some children with older parents may feel that they are not doing enough to help. Feelings of guilt are associated with a lack of reciprocity in the support relationship. The less support people give to their mother, in comparison to how much support they receive, the stronger the feelings of guilt. With an increasing number of ageing parents in most high-income societies, demand for social and practical support from children increases and this may create more occasion for guilt to develop. It also seems that children who have strong norms about what people should do for their parents feel guilty more often. People set high standards for themselves, which in turn may lead to a feeling of not having done enough.</p><p>It was expected that infrequent contact would be associated with guilt but while people who had only monthly contact with their mothers feel guiltier, people with less than monthly contact did not report significantly more guilt than those with weekly contact. That primarily the monthly-contact group feels more guilt fits with a pattern of a good relationship that carries a cultural expectation of more frequent contact than can be achieved.</p><p>In psychological theory, guilt is often seen as a negative emotion that motivates positive behavioral change. This theory can also be applied to the mother-child bond. For example, guilt that arises from not visiting enough may motivate children to visit more, hence, reducing guilt. But guilt may also be reduced when parents exercise moderation in their downward support, letting the stream of support turn more quickly in the expected upward direction, from children to parents. Guilt is not always productive. When guilt arises from negative emotions such as anger and irritation, both of which are measured in this study, it is less clear which productive changes a person could make. Guilt that stems from ambivalence may therefore be perceived as more awkward. Adult children may visit their parents more often or offer more support when they feel guilty, but changing the way they feel about their parents is a different matter. This would require a change of expectations and a change in norms. Such mental and cultural changes are more difficult to achieve.</p><p><em>Featured image by congerdesign via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/623518132/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/confronting-mortality-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Confronting mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-multiple-sclerosis-drug-may-speed-covid-19-recovery">A multiple sclerosis drug may speed COVID-19 recovery</a></h4>

<p>A drug that boosts the immune system may
help some people with COVID-19 fight off infections quickly, at least when
taken in the early stages of the illness, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>People taking a drug cocktail containing
one of the body’s natural immune chemicals called interferon beta 1b plus a
combination HIV drug and an antiviral drug took <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31042-4/fulltext">seven
days to recover</a> from COVID-19. In comparison, it took people on only the
HIV combo drug 12 days to get better, researchers report May 8 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Recovery included reduced
shedding of virus, improvements in symptoms and discharge from the hospital.</p>



<p>In a previous study, the HIV combo <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial">lopinavir
and ritonavir was not effective</a> at combatting coronavirus infections in
seriously ill people (<em>SN: 3/19/20</em>).
In the new research, people who had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less
recovered quickly, but the cocktail didn’t speed up recovery for those that had
been sick longer, the researchers found. </p>



<p>The study took place in Hong Kong, where
everyone diagnosed with COVID-19 was required to go to the hospital until they
were virus-free for two days. All 127 people in the study had mild to moderate
symptoms. None were critically ill and none died. (Hong Kong has recorded four
COVID-19 deaths as of May 8.) As a result, the findings may not be applicable
to more seriously ill patients. </p>

<p>But the results do underscore the need
to treat the disease as soon as possible, says Warner Greene, a virologist at
the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco who was not involved in the work. “If
you’re going to attack the virus, attack it early before it can get a really
big foothold.” </p>



<p>Interferon beta 1b is one of the immune
chemicals that the body produces to goad immune cells into fighting viruses.
SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, contains genes that can
hamper the interferon signal. Providing extra interferon beta 1b may counteract
those tricks, keeping people from becoming seriously ill, Greene says. </p>



<p>Waiting to treat people until they’re
seriously ill risks the virus replicating out of control and provoking the
immune system into brewing up a storm of inflammatory chemicals that can damage
organs and lung function so badly that patients can’t breathe without the help
of a ventilator. “The cow’s really out of the barn, maybe off the farm by the
time people get intubated,” Greene says. At that point, antivirals are mostly
useless and adding interferon to the mix would probably make things worse.</p>



<p>But for people in the study who got
injections of interferon early in the illness, levels of inflammation-causing
immune chemicals went down as did the amount of virus in the people’s nasal
passages, saliva and throats. Interferon beta 1b is used to help control some
forms of multiple sclerosis, although exactly how the drug helps that disease
isn’t yet understood. </p>





<p>Interferon’s antiviral properties are
better known. The drug has shown some effectiveness against SARS and MERS in
laboratory tests, and several clinical trials are testing various types of
interferon, including beta 1b, against COVID-19.</p>



<p>While this study contained a comparison
group, interferon’s effect wasn’t tested against a placebo. It also wasn’t “blinded.”
That means that doctors, nurses and patients all knew which groups the patients
were in, which may have influenced the outcome in some way. Larger, blinded
trials comparing interferon beta 1b with placebos will probably be needed before
it becomes commonly used, Greene says. And it probably won’t be administered
alone.</p>

<p>“I’m almost certain that therapy will be
a cocktail of agents, rather than a single agent,” he says. Combining
interferon beta 1b with an antiviral such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">remdesivir,</a>
which was recently shown to speed recovery from COVID-19 (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>), and perhaps another drug that attacks the virus in a
different way, he says, “could be lights out great.”</p>



<p>Having another drug besides remdesivir
give positive results is “refreshing,” says Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious
disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco not involved
in the study. “It may give people in the rest of the world hope for treating
sick COVID patients.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-door-to-door-testing-corvallis-oregon">Door-to-door tests help track COVID-19’s spread in one Oregon town</a></h4>

<p>Through mid-May, researchers will be knocking on doors in
Corvallis, Ore., and asking people inside their homes if they’d agree to a
coronavirus test. These door-to-door tests, which began on April 19, may be the
first of their kind in the country, the scientists say, and will help determine
whether people currently have the virus that causes COVID-19. The tests promise
to provide an accurate estimate of infection rates in the college town of about
60,000 people. </p>



<p><a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/trace-first-week%E2%80%99s-results-suggest-two-people-1000-corvallis-were-infected-sars-cov-2">Preliminary
results</a> suggest that approximately 2 in 1,000 people in Corvallis had SARS-CoV-2,
the virus that causes COVID-19, when they were tested over the weekend of April
25 and 26, researchers report May 7. That rate is lower than
estimates from some other places in the United States and globally, and lower
than at other time points during the pandemic, but still high enough to be
concerned about, the team says.   </p>



<p>The weekends of testing involve asking families to swab
their noses and put the samples into a container on the doorstep, while
researchers wait outside at a safe distance. <em>Science News</em> spoke with population biologist Benjamin Dalziel at
Oregon State University, one of the researchers leading the study, called <a href="https://trace.oregonstate.edu/about-trace-covid-19">TRACE-COVID-19</a>. This
interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What can random door-to-door sampling tell us that other methods,
like drive-up tents, can’t?</strong> </p>





<p><strong>Dalziel:</strong> The door-to-door
piece is very important. Embedded into the case counts that we get from other
projects are barriers to health care, which are numerous and include the
ability to access a tent [or] the types of people who will click on a Facebook ad
to get mailed a test. That’s a biased sample. </p>



<p>The truly representative sample of a community that’s
obtained by going door to door is one of the key values of this study. By
randomly sampling a large number of individuals — our target is 960 a weekend —
you get that representative sample. Each team goes to a single neighborhood,
and works that neighborhood for two days. If someone isn’t home, there’s a
chance to go back the next day. </p>



<p>This is also an opportunity to engage with the community. We
leave behind informational material. There are other benefits than just
reducing barriers to access. </p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How quickly was the project put together?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dalziel: </strong>It was
four to six weeks of feverish problem solving.… We felt like we were assembling
an airplane in midair. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How do you pick the houses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dalziel:</strong> The
first stage is we select neighborhoods. Thirty neighborhoods is our current
number, and we’re shooting for somewhere between eight and 16 households in each
one. It depends on how many people are home.</p>



<p>Each team goes to a neighborhood, and selects households at
random by starting in a particular place and going to every 5th or 6th or 8th
house, walking in a certain pattern. A simple example is always turning right. </p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How are people reacting? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Dalziel:</strong> It is extraordinary.
The response is overwhelmingly positive. Most folks knew who we were and wanted
to participate. For instance, when we first went out, within two minutes of
parking, somebody cruised by, rolled down the window, and said, “Hey, you’re
those TRACE people! Thank you so much. Can you come to my house?” </p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>How do your early results compare with others, such as Seattle
SCAN’s, which uses tests by mail?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dalziel:  </strong>Our results are similar to <a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SCAN_PUBLIC_SITREP-30APR-5PM.pdf">those from the Seattle SCAN study</a> for April 16 to April 21.… Our estimate of
approximately 2 infected people out of 1,000 is lower than some other places
and times, and we can be grateful for that. </p>



<p>But it is still high enough to be concerning. If we relaxed social
distancing too quickly, this prevalence would be sufficient to initiate a
second phase of exponential growth in the epidemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em> The study is designed to last about a month. What comes next? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Dalziel:</strong> We’re working to incorporate antibody [testing] as fast as we can. As the news indicates, the antibody question has some complexities to it…. Our current funding is for a four-week, first phase study. We’re actively looking at a number of ways to scale up.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oobleck-cornstarch-water-running-physics">Physicists have found a way to foil a classic oobleck science trick</a></h4>

<p>It takes guts to attempt running across
the surface of a liquid. Even more so if a sneaky physicist is nearby.</p>



<p>A mixture of cornstarch and water known
as oobleck solidifies when hit with a forceful impact. That effect makes for a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-walk-water">classic science party trick</a>, in which participants run across the liquid’s
surface (<em>SN: 7/16/12</em>). But a new
technique could <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaay6661">sink those runners</a>, researchers report May 8 in<em>
Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Oobleck is a non-Newtonian fluid,
meaning that its viscosity changes depending upon the forces exerted on it. Other
non-Newtonian fluids include ketchup and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-gives-frog-tongues-gift-grab">frog saliva</a>
(<em>SN: 1/31/17</em>), both of which get
thinner with applied force, in contrast to oobleck.</p>



<p>In laboratory experiments, a cylinder
dropped onto the surface of oobleck sank more quickly when researchers rapidly
rotated the mixture’s container clockwise and counterclockwise. Normally, the
impact of the cylinder would cause particles of cornstarch to come into contact
with one another, jamming up into a solid. But by oscillating the container, “you
basically move the particles so they are no longer in contact, and this makes it
liquid again,” says physicist <a>Meera Ramaswamy </a>of Cornell
University.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>In response to an impact, a mixture of cornstarch and water thickens into a solid. So a  cylinder hitting the surface of that mixture sinks slowly. But when the container is rotated back and forth, it essentially reliquifies the mixture and the cylinder sinks more quickly. The same technique could be used to foil a classic physics demo: people running across the surface of the liquid.</figure>



<p>The same effect, Ramaswamy and colleagues
say, would sink a foot impacting the surface of oobleck in a rotating tub. It
could also be useful in industrial processes involving similar fluids, for
example, preventing clogs in tubes that carry cement.</p>



<p>The next step, she says, is to try the technique on a larger scale, in hopes of foiling would-be runners.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">Deadly temperatures expected to arrive later this century are already here</a></h4>

<p>Human beings have a superpower —
sweating.</p>



<p>When temperatures rise, beads of
sweat exude from our pores and evaporate, releasing energy that cools the skin
and keeps our bodies from overheating.</p>



<p>This self-cooling mechanism has helped humans spread to every hot and humid corner of the globe. But that sweating superpower has a theoretical upper limit: When it gets too hot and humid, the laws of physics inhibit sweat from cooling skin. That limit is hit when a bulb thermometer wrapped in a wet towel (a measure of heat and humidity known as “wet-bulb” temperature) reads 35<strong>° </strong>Celsius, or 95<strong>°</strong> Fahrenheit. Even the fittest human supplied with unlimited water would probably die after a few hours in these conditions.</p>



<p>Scientists have thought that this temperature
extreme occurs rarely, if ever, on Earth. But as the globe warms, wet-bulb
temperatures around 35<strong>° </strong>C could become <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-india-pakistan-2100">more
common toward the end of the century</a> in certain
regions, endangering hundreds of millions of people, recent climate
simulations suggest (<em>SN: 8/2/17</em>).</p>





<p>It turns out we won’t have to wait
that long. </p>



<p>An analysis of global weather
station data shows that this human survivability limit has been briefly surpassed
<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaaw1838">at least a dozen times
in the last four decades</a> at sites along the Persian Gulf and Indus
River Valley in India and Pakistan, researchers report May 8 in <em>Science
Advances.</em> Slightly lower, but still dangerous, wet-bulb temperatures are
increasingly familiar features of summer across larger swaths of the Middle
East, South Asia and the U.S. Gulf Coast, the study shows. </p>





<p>“We
expect these extreme wet-bulb values to be rare, but to become more common as
the world warms,” says Matthew Huber, a climate scientist at Purdue University
in West Lafayette, Ind., who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s disturbing to
see it happening in real time.”</p>



<p>Researchers
have only relatively recently begun using statistical simulations to estimate
where and when this extreme moist-heat threshold might be approached or
crossed, which could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">dire
consequences for societies.</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>). But these models work
by simplifying and aggregating weather station data across a region. The fine
details often get sacrificed in service of broader trends, potentially
obscuring local spots where the temperature threshold is briefly reached.</p>



<p>Those
fine details matter to Colin Raymond, a climate scientist at NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Whether temperatures already have
reached this physiological limit somewhere on Earth “seems almost to be an
essential piece of knowledge for us as a species,” says Raymond, who did the
work while at Columbia University.</p>



<p>He and
his team scoured data from 4,576 weather
stations across the globe, looking for instances of extreme wet-bulb
temperatures and tracking trends from 1979 to 2017. After removing measurements
that didn’t jibe with nearby stations or seemed like obvious errors, a clear
pattern emerged: Extreme wet-bulb temperatures have occurred, mostly along
subtropical coasts, where warm, moist air from the ocean collides with hot air
on land. In South Asia, such extremes are fueled by monsoon winds.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Too hot spots</h3>



<p>Researchers analyzed data from over 4,000 weather stations to determine which regions experience the highest “wet-bulb” temperatures, a measure of heat and humidity. The color of each square represents the highest such temperature recorded at each station from 1979 to 2017. Red represents a mix of heat and humidity that is close to or at the threshold at which human bodies can no longer handle the temperature for an extended period of time.</p>

</div>



<p>Temperatures
at or beyond that physiological limit were rare and confined to an hour or two
at hot spots along the Persian Gulf, such as a weather station at the Abu Dhabi
International Airport in the United Arab Emirates. Nearly 1.5 million people
live in Abu Dhabi. (<a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/themes/sotp-foundation/dataviz/heat-humidity-map/">An interactive map</a> created
by the researchers plots the highest wet-bulb temperatures recorded at stations
across the world.)</p>



<p>The team
also documented wet-bulb temperatures of 33° C, which roughly translates to a
heat index of 60<strong>°</strong> C or 139<strong>° </strong>F. (The heat index, or
what a temperature feels like with humidity, isn’t designed to go this high, so
comparisons are rough.) That temperature is just shy of the physiological limit
but still “much hotter and more humid than many of us have experienced,” Raymond
says. The analysis found that 40 years ago, these events happened once or twice
a year on Earth. But now, such oppressive moist-heat events happen 25 to 30
times a year. “There is a doubling or more of these extreme events over four
decades,” he says. </p>



<p>So are
the simulations predicting that these temperatures wouldn’t arrive until
midcentury wrong?</p>



<p>Not
necessarily, says Joy Merwin Monteiro, a climate scientist at the Indian
Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, who wasn’t involved in the
study. “Models are too coarse to give a clear picture of what’s happening at
these finer spatial and temporal scales.” Monteiro says that complementing
existing models with more detailed, on-the-ground data is long overdue.</p>



<p>If carbon
emissions aren’t drastically curbed in the coming decades, these relatively
rare extremes will become increasingly common, researchers say. Such conditions
are unbearable without technology like air conditioning and make outdoor labor
near impossible.</p>



<p>“We may have to rethink how to live in a place that’s experiencing conditions outside of what we’ve evolved to experience,” Raymond says. “Living in the Persian Gulf in the summer may come to resemble living at the South Pole in the winter.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-dead-dwarf-galaxies-make-stars-again-gas">How tiny ‘dead’ galaxies get their groove back and make stars again</a></h4>

<p>Talk about
sibling rivalry. Most of the smallest galaxies are “dead,” making no new stars.
Now, computer simulations reveal why it is so hard for a tiny galaxy to
rejuvenate itself: The galaxy’s existing stars fight the birth of any new ones,
even after fresh fuel for star formation falls into the galaxy. </p>



<p>These simulations
also show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09530">eventually new stars
can arise</a> and make the galaxy sparkle again. But it can take many billions
of years for a little galaxy to get its star-making mojo back, researchers
report April 20 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Galaxies spawn
new stars from gas, but the gas must be cold and dense to collapse into stars. That
requirement spelled big trouble for little galaxies soon after the universe’s
birth, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-leaking-distant-galaxy-hints-reionization-origins">ultraviolet
radiation from galaxies broke intergalactic hydrogen atoms</a> into protons and
electrons (<em>SN: 11/7/19</em>). This process, called reionization, let
radiation stream through space and heat gas inside galaxies. The smallest
galaxies had so little gas to begin with that it all got zapped by the ionizing
radiation. As a result, the typical low-mass dwarf galaxy stopped creating stars
long ago.</p>



<p>In these tiny
galaxies, “reionization killed star formation,” says Martin Rey, an
astrophysicist at Lund Observatory in Sweden. All the stars in most low-mass
dwarf galaxies today are therefore <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/primordial-stars-left-their-imprint-dwarf-galaxy">ancient</a>
(<em>SN: 4/3/15</em>).</p>





<p>But two
unrelated dwarf galaxies in the constellation Leo, named Leo P and Leo T, never
got the memo. Puny even by dwarf standards, both galaxies still eke out new
stars. They are the least luminous star-forming galaxies known: Leo P’s stellar
mass is only 560,000 solar masses, about 0.001 percent of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-delivers-trove-data-revealing-secrets-milky-way">Milky
Way’s total</a>, and Leo T has even fewer stars (<em>SN: 5/9/18</em>). Both galaxies
are the Milky Way’s neighbors — Leo P is 5 million light-years and Leo T is
just 1.3 million light-years away — so astronomers can see the newborn stars.</p>



<p>To explain how
such small galaxies thrive today, Rey’s team ran computer simulations of the
gas, stars and dark matter in low-mass dwarf galaxies. The simulations showed
that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">infalling
gas</a> can resuscitate dwarf galaxies and reignite their star formation, a
finding supported by earlier work (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>). But “we find that it
takes quite a long time,” Rey says.</p>



<p>The problem is
that old stars in the dwarf galaxy prevent the birth of new stars by stirring
up the gas, the researchers found. In particular, exploding white dwarf stars
and winds from large red aging stars heat the gas, delaying the new era of star
birth. In fact, 6 to 8 billion years — about half <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks">the
age of the universe</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/18</em>) — can pass before little dwarf
galaxies resume their star-making careers and resemble Leo P and Leo T, the scientists
report. </p>



<p>“Their results
are very plausible,” says Kristen McQuinn, an astrophysicist at Rutgers
University in Piscataway, N.J., who has studied Leo P in the past but was not
involved with the new work. She says including the negative effects of the
galaxy’s own stars makes the simulations unique. </p>



<p>Rey and his
colleagues also found something else. “The kind of surprise and cherry on the
cake was the fact that we can predict a new class of galaxies,” Rey says. The
simulations show that some low-mass dwarf galaxies have acquired gas but not yet
begun to mint new stars.</p>



<p>No definite examples of gas-rich dwarf galaxies that lack
star formation are known, Rey says, but he predicts future observations will
uncover them. New optical telescopes should find the faint old stars in these
galaxies, and radio telescopes should detect their hydrogen gas, which may
someday spawn new stars.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comb-jellies-cannibalism-young-food-prey-scarce">Some comb jellies cannibalize their young when food is scarce</a></h4>

<p>Some jellies go
ballistic when their prey disappears — cannibalistic that is. </p>



<p>Warty comb jellies,
native to the western Atlantic Ocean, invaded Eurasian waters in the 1980s. The
jellies have since flourished, cycling through population booms during summer when
prey is abundant and busts in fall and winter when it’s not. Now a study finds
that to persist when food is scarce, adult jellies eat their young. </p>



<p>Understanding how a
“brainless, fragile animal” conquers new environments could reveal new ways to
control the invasive species, says Jamileh Javidpour, a marine ecologist at the
University of Southern Denmark in Odense. </p>



<p>Javidpour and her colleagues
collected adult and larval comb jellies (<em>Mnemiopsis
leidyi</em>) from Kiel Fjord — an
inlet of the Baltic Sea east of Germany — in August and September of 2008, before and
after the jelly population collapsed. As the adults’ preferred food source, small
crustaceans called copepods, plummeted at the end of August, young comb jellies
also began to disappear. By the end of the collapse, adults made up the bulk of
the population. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Juvenile comb jellies" class="wp-image-3087788" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050620_eg_combjelly_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087788">Juvenile comb jellies (indicated with red arrows) can be seen inside the auricles of an adult collected from Kiel Fjord in 2008. Jellies use their auricles to help draw in prey.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087788">Jamileh Javidpour</span></figure>



<p>Back in the lab, the researchers chemically
labelled larvae with a rare type, or isotope, of nitrogen, and placed the young
jellies with starved adults. After 36 hours, those adults had higher levels of
the isotope than adults fed a normal diet, a sign that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0940-2">the animals consumed
the larvae</a>, the team reports May 7
in <em>Communications Biology</em>. </p>



<p>Because larvae can’t
survive the cold winters, the study suggests that this <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-origins-shift-comb-jellies">comb jelly species</a> ramps up reproduction in late summer — when it might
otherwise be counterproductive — in
order to feast on its young and bulk up before winter (<em>SN: 12/12/13</em>). </p>



<p>“We thought that it was
self-infecting harm,” says coauthor Thomas Larsen, a biologist at the Max
Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. But it
seems the jellies are “building up resources for the winter.” </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-beer-brewing-malt-grains-europe">Brewing beer may be an older craft than we realized in some places</a></h4>

<p>Microscopic
signatures of malting could help reveal which prehistoric people had a taste
for beer. </p>



<p>Ancient beer is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/original-microbrews">difficult to trace</a>, because many of beer’s chemical ingredients, like alcohol, don’t preserve well (<em>SN: 9/28/04</em>). But a new analysis of modern and ancient malted grain indicates that malting’s effects on grain cell structure can last millennia. This microscopic evidence could help fill in the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231696">archaeological record of beer consumption</a>, providing insight into the social, ritual and dietary roles this drink played in prehistoric cultures, researchers report online May 7 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. </p>



<p>Malting,
the first step in brewing beer, erodes cell walls in an outer layer of a grain seed,
called its aleurone layer. To find out whether that cell wall thinning would
still be visible in grains malted thousands of years ago, Andreas Heiss, an
archaeobotanist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, and colleagues
simulated archaeological preservation by baking malted barley in a furnace. Using
a scanning electron microscope, the researchers observed thinned aleurone cell
walls in the resulting malt residue. Heiss’s team found a similar pattern of
thinning in residues from 5,000- to 6,000-year-old containers at two Egyptian
breweries. </p>



<p>The
researchers then inspected grain-based remains from similarly aged settlements in
Germany and in Switzerland. These sites didn’t contain any tools specifically
associated with beer-making. But grain-based residues from inside containers at
the settlements did show thin aleurone cell walls, like those in the Egyptian
remains — offering the oldest evidence of malting in central Europe, the
researchers say. </p>



<p>Heiss
and colleagues suspect the malted residue from one of the settlements in
Germany was beer, because the sample has characteristics of dried-up liquid,
such as cracks along its surface. But remains found at other sites may be other
types of malted foodstuffs, like bread or porridge. </p>

<p>This bowl-shaped hunk of cereal residue (left) from a settlement near Lake Constance in Germany dates back to about 3910 B.C. A scanning electron microscopy image (right) of the residue reveals thinning of the cell walls around aleurone cells (marked A), which is characteristic of malted grains. The researchers interpret this as some of the oldest evidence of malting in central Europe, and possibly the oldest evidence of beer in the region. </p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>What happens to people when they lose their religion? Do they start to think and act just like people who have never believed — or do they keep some psychological and behavioural traces of their past?</p>
<p>Given the number of people worldwide who report no current religious affiliation (more than 1 billion) and predictions that this will <a href="http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org">expand into the future</a>, it’s important to explore just how homogenous, or otherwise, this group is, argue the researchers behind a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17410-001">new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences</em>.</p>
<p>Daryl R. Van Tongeren at Hope College, US, and his colleagues conclude from their studies that there is in fact a “religious residue” that clings to people who cease to identify as religious. “Formerly religious individuals differed from never religious and currently religious individuals in cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes,” the team reports.</p>
<p><span id="more-39578"></span>Why might such a residue exist? Because for people who are religious, the kinds of attitudes and behaviours that go along with religion are likely to be important to the way those individuals see themselves. Picture someone who grew up in a strongly Christian household, for example, with parents who promoted Christian morals, and who volunteered their time through the church. Even if that person later no longer identifies as Christian, these experiences may have enduring psychological impacts. Our social identities <em>can</em> change, the researchers note, but this usually only happens slowly.</p>
<p>For their first study, the team recruited just over 3,000 nationally representative online participants from the US, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. These people were asked about their religious identity, beliefs and practices, and the extent to which they were exposed to religious behaviours during childhood. Then they completed a (very brief) measure of their subjective prosociality (their perception of their helpfulness towards other people, for example), a scale that measured their social values, and also a test that assessed their attitudes towards God.</p>
<p>The team found that a sizeable proportion — 20.94% — of the participants reported being formerly religious. And, they argue, their data revealed evidence for a religious residue effect. On various measures, including religiosity, self-reported prosociality and prosocial orientation (such as wanting everyone in a group to do well, rather than aiming for individual success), currently religious participants scored the highest, followed by formerly religious and finally never religious people. This was true for each of the three nationalities sampled.</p>
<p>To explore this further, the team ran a second study on 1,626 men and women from the same countries. This time, there were equivalent numbers of never-religious, formerly religious and currently religious participants. And as well as repeating the steps in the first study, these people were given the option of donating a percentage of their participation payment to Save the Children, and also of volunteering to complete another short survey (they could offer anything between 5 and 15 minutes of their time).</p>
<p>Among those who agreed to volunteer for the extra survey, the currently religious gave up more time than both the other groups. Currently religious people also donated more of their money to charity than formerly religious people — but this group in turn donated more than the never religious. This shows that formerly religious people don’t just say they are more prosocial but act in a more prosocial way than never-religious types, the team says.</p>
<p>Well, this particular study seems to show that. But, remember, the participants in both these studies were all first asked about their religious identity. If, as the researchers argue, being prosocial is an important element of being religious, then currently religious, and even previously religious, participants had all just been primed to think of religion, and (whether consciously or not) everything that goes with that. Van Tongeren maintains that as the participants were asked a host of different questions, this is unlikely to be an issue. But I don’t think they can rule out the possibility that this inflated these groups’ prosociality scores.</p>
<p>For the final study, the team shifted to data from New Zealand collected between 2009 and 2017 as part of an annual, longitudinal national sample of registered voters. This revealed that volunteering was about twice as common among religious vs non-religious people. It also showed that the annual chance of a participant losing their religion but still spending time in voluntary or charitable work was much higher than the chance of someone losing their religion and stopping volunteering. This supports the religious residue hypothesis, the researchers argue.</p>
<p>But plenty of non-religious people also volunteered their time. Being the kind of person who volunteers could constitute an important aspect of anyone’s social identity, in and of itself, and so be resistant to change, whether you are religious or not. However, Van Tongeren maintains that the data provides evidence for the “lingering effects of prosociality, even after people stop identifying as religious”.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/memory-replay-brain-sleep-learning">A game based on Simon shows how people mentally rehearse new information</a></h4>

<p>A brain at rest isn’t always resting. Sometimes it’s
rehearsing information it just learned. </p>



<p>For the first time, scientists have watched this mental replay in two human volunteers. These neural ruminations, described May 5 in <em>Cell Reports</em>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30530-1">might play a role in making a new, fragile memory more durable</a>, scientists suspect. </p>



<p>Most examples of mental replay, in which nerve cells fire off signals in a sequence that matches that of the original learning, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-sleep-learning-memory-remember-forget">come from animals other than humans</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>). But tests of two paralyzed men participating in the BrainGate2 clinical trial offered a way to observe this rehearsal in humans. </p>



<p>In the study,
electrode arrays were implanted in the participants’ brains and linked to
computers, with the goal of developing ways to allow people’s thoughts to
control computer cursors and other devices. Two volunteers played a copycat
game similar to Simon, in which four colored quadrants, each with a different
sound tone, light up in a specific sequence. In this case, participants’ brain
activity moved a cursor, copying the sequence.</p>



<p>Every so often, researchers sneaked in patterns that
repeated more often than the others. Compared with less common sequences, these
familiar sequences were more likely to have sparked neural replays in
participants’ brains during post-game rests, Jean-Baptiste Eichenlaub of
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston and
colleagues found. </p>



<p>This replay happened during sleep and quiet resting. During these repeats, the neural patterns corresponding to the Simon pattern stayed the same, but the sequences could be faster or slower than the original. Scientists don’t yet know whether these mental rehearsals actually strengthen memories.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has been <a href="https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/">no exception</a>, and in fact, has highlighted how misinformation and disinformation can damage public health response efforts.  In particular, damage to trust, heightened confusion, and intensified discord can widen the gap between effective public health interventions and public willingness to support them.</p>
<p>Misinformation about disease outbreaks spreads rapidly in information voids, when there is little true information to ground viewers in the reality of the current situation. While we are learning more every day, there are many unknowns about COVID-19. As a result, the continued lack of definitive information on the virus and its spread has created an opportunity for misinformation and disinformation to take root.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent research published by our team takes a close look at misinformation during October 2014, when cases of Ebola were identified in the US. We sought to understand misinformation in the context of an emerging, fear-inducing disease in order to draw lessons for future outbreaks or epidemics that might similarly frighten the public. Little did we know that we would be publishing this research in the midst of one of the largest and most severe pandemics in recent history.  The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11863 alignleft" height="183" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/question-3385451_640-300x183.jpg" width="300" />First, we learned that misinformation can come in many forms, making it harder for people to determine what information is correct. While about 5% of the tweets we reviewed were false, another 5% were partially true or subtle misinterpretations of true information. While it may seem simple to label information as either true or false, we found making this distinction to be incredibly nuanced. In the process of hand coding thousands of tweets, even trained coders with public health expertise sometimes found that distinguishing between true and misleading information was challenging and required the combined judgement of several people.  Many people may not be able to take the time to carefully and objectively verify nuanced half-truths, instead making judgements based on their own knowledge, experiences, and worldview.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found a strong tie between misinformation and political content</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, we found a strong tie between misinformation and political content. We had initially, and perhaps naively, thought that misinformation during a health event like an Ebola outbreak would primarily be framed in a health context. Instead, we observed great overlap in misinformation, political tweets, and tweets that seemed designed to induce societal <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567">discord.</a> Additionally, both the 2014 Ebola outbreak and COVID-19 have occurred during contentious US election years, and there are indications that COVID-19 misinformation has been <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/03/18/knowledge-and-perception-surrounding-covid-19/">politicized.</a> An important lesson emerging from this is that public health events, response activities, and communication efforts, while often apolitical in their inception, can be vehicles for messages that serve goals beyond ensuring the health of the public.</p>
<p>Finally, we found a several different misinformation types or tropes. Government conspiracies, false rumors of concerning viral characteristics (eg airborne transmission of the Ebola virus), and fake cures were the most frequent types. Today, we see these same <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/what-can-coronavirus-tell-us-about-conspiracy-theories/610894/">rumor tropes</a> appearing during the COVID-19 epidemic. In our sample of Ebola-related tweets, some rumors were refuted, but many were not, casting some doubt on the ability of social media to self-correct effectively.

Further research is needed to understand how best to reach populations resistant to traditional public health messaging and health authorities. While essential efforts must be taken by social media platforms to control the spread of misinformation, the suggestion that technology companies should simply act to stop the dissemination of often nuanced and subtle misinformation overlooks the role of many other important stakeholders – and our own need to take a hard look in the mirror and improve the ways that we, as members of both the public and scientific community, consume and provide information to others.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-power-plant-warm-water-tropical-ecosystem">Warming water can create a tropical ecosystem, but a fragile one</a></h4>

<p>A
decade ago, the waters off the Otomi Peninsula in the Sea of Japan, were a
tepid haven. Schools of sapphire damselfish flitted above herds of long-spined
urchins. The site was a hot spot of tropical biodiversity far from the equator,
thanks to warm water exhaust from a nearby nuclear power plant. But when the
plant ceased operations in 2012, those tropical species vanished. </p>



<p>After the plant shut down, Otomi’s average bottom temperature fell by 3 degrees Celsius, and the site <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232065">lost most of its tropical fishes</a>, fisheries scientist Reiji Masuda of Kyoto University reports May 6 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. The die-off of tropical fishes and invertebrates was “striking,” he says. Otomi quickly reverted to a cool-water ecosystem.</p>



<p>The
life and death of the reef is providing a sneak peek into the future of
temperate habitats under climate change. This research suggests that even
modest warming can result in dramatic changes to cool-water reefs, with some
temperate habitats converting to more tropical ones. But these emerging reefs may
not match the diversity or health of other more established tropical reefs at
first, leaving them as ecologically fragile as the Otomi reef proved to be.</p>



<p>While
some temperate reefs are changing rapidly with global warming, they aren’t
exact transplants of more established tropical ecosystems, says David
Booth, a
marine ecologist at the University of Technology Sydney not involved in the new
study. Booth studies increasingly tropical Australian reefs. </p>





<p>“People
always ask us, ‘Oh, that means even though the Barrier Reef’s in trouble with
bleaching, in a couple of years Sydney will be the new Barrier Reef?’” Booth
says. Sydney is merely acquiring a handful of tropical fish and coral, he says,
“so, it ain’t the Barrier Reef by any means. Just a coral community starting,
that’s all.”</p>



<h4>Rapid die-off</h4>



<p>In
October 2003, while studying groupers at Otomi, Masuda noticed lots of tropical
fishes that seemed out of place. Parts of southern Japan host tropical reefs,
but Otomi sits at about 35° N, a zone typically occupied by seaweeds and associated
fishes. The source of this anomaly was the Takahama nuclear power plant, only 2
kilometers away, which released warm water into the ocean after using it to
cool reactors. </p>



<p>In
2004, Masuda began surveying Otomi and two other nearby sites, cataloging and
counting fish. Then the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck in 2011, precipitating
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Japan stopped running all of its
nuclear plants in response, including Takahama in 2012. As the warm discharge
ceased, Otomi became an impromptu natural experiment in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/resilience-protects-corals-hurricanes-and-climate-change">resiliency</a> (<em>SN: 12/5/14</em>), and Masuda kept collecting
data for the next five years. </p>



<p>Soon,
he started seeing dead and dying fish everywhere. “In normal marine
environments, we scarcely see a dead fish,” says Masuda, since fish usually die
by being eaten. But around Otomi, fish were succumbing en masse to the cold
temperatures instead. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3087750" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050620_jb_fish_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087750">Neon damselfish (<em>Pomacentrus coelestis</em>) once congregated in Otomi’s warm water (left). But after a nearby nuclear power plant shut down, the waters cooled. Now, Japanese rockbass (<em>Sebastes cheni</em>) and the wrasse <em>Halichoeres tenuispinis</em> — typical species in temperate Japan — swim among sargassum seaweed (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087750">Reiji Masuda</span></figure>



<p>Masuda
was also surprised at how quickly Otomi shifted back to a temperate ecosystem. “Only
two months after the die-out of tropical, poisonous sea urchins, temperate sea
urchins appeared,” he says. “The sargassum seaweed bed recovered with some
temperate fishes such as common wrasse and rockfish.”</p>



<h4>Sneak peek</h4>



<p>Otomi
may provide a preview of some of the changes temperate reefs could experience as
the global climate warms. After decades of warm water, Otomi still had no
shelter-providing corals or large, tropical predators.</p>



<p>That
lack of predators may have been behind Otomi’s high densities of tropical
urchins, which had stripped the seabed clear of algae, obliterating access to
food and shelter for many other species. There was nothing “to control their
number and thus to maintain a healthy ecosystem,” he says. </p>



<p>Masuda
thinks it’s possible the die-offs were so severe and abrupt because of this poor
ecosystem health. With species diversity lower than other tropical
systems, the lack of redundancy can make the whole ecosystem more susceptible
to stressors. In this case, that stress was a drop in temperature.</p>



<p>If
there were many different species of urchin in the tropicalized reef, there’d
be a higher chance that some could tolerate lower temperatures, Masuda points
out. “This applies to fishes, too,” he says. “In healthy tropical ecosystems,
there are many species — some should be relatively robust to temperature
changes.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere
in Japan, warming seas have already led to complete ecosystem shifts from kelp
forests to coral, upending fisheries, Booth notes. </p>



<p>As for Otomi, it may get another chance to be a natural experiment. In May 2017, the Takahama nuclear reactor turned back on, and Masuda has been diving and collecting data on the return of tropical fishes and urchins as the waters warm. Analyzing this much slower change, he says, “will be another fish to fry.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakebite-treatment-unithiol-heavy-metal-poisoning">A pill for heavy metal poisoning may also save snakebite victims</a></h4>

<p>Doctors
have long sought a “snakebite pill” that can deliver life-prolonging medicine
when and where it’s most needed. Now experiments with an existing drug that
treats heavy metal poisoning are stoking that dream.</p>



<p>Given
orally, the drug saved or extended the lives of mice <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aay8314">injected
with lethal doses of viper venom</a>, researchers report May 6 in <em>Science
Translational Medicine.</em> </p>



<p>Snakebites
kill <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/snakebite-envenoming">tens
of thousands of people</a> every year, and leave many more with damaged limbs, in
part due to difficulty getting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakebite-treatment-buys-time">quick,
effective treatment</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/11</em>).
These bites often occur in remote locations, so many snakebite victims may have
to travel hours or even days before reaching a medical facility equipped to
provide lifesaving antivenom intravenously. </p>



<p>Nicholas
Casewell, a biomedical scientist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine
in England, and his colleagues set out to find something portable and easy to
administer that could counteract some of the most widespread and dangerous
venom toxins: snake venom metalloproteases. Often a major component in blood-poisoning
venoms, like those of many vipers, these toxins cause a suite of issues, including
massive internal hemorrhaging and tissue damage around the bite site. </p>





<p>The
toxins, however, have an Achilles’ heel. “They rely on zinc ions to function,”
Casewell says.</p>



<p>Drugs
used to treat heavy metal poisoning bind up loose metal ions, so the researchers
wondered if those drugs could also starve the toxins of zinc. One in particular
— a compound called unithiol — did just that. </p>



<p>The
researchers didn’t give the mice actual pills — the capsules were too large for
the small animals to swallow. But oral administration of the liquid form of the
drug 15 minutes after venom injection delayed the death of mice compared with
mice that didn’t get the drug, and even boosted the survival of some mice. For
example, of the five mice injected with West African carpet viper venom and
given the drug, two lived and three lasted from 12 to 21 hours, while those
that didn’t get the drug died within four hours. </p>



<p>Quickly
administered oral unithiol worked as well as a delayed antivenom treatment — and
even better when paired with it, the researchers found. Unithiol also prevented
local tissue damage at the site of venom injection, suggesting that the drug could
help prevent disabilities in addition to saving lives.</p>



<p>Researchers
have wondered whether drugs that bind up metal ions could treat viper bites
since the 1980s, says Leslie Boyer, a clinical researcher who studies envenomation
treatment at the University of Arizona in Tuscon. “This is an old drug, and
it’s an old concept that’s finally being put to the test,” she says. But she
stresses that results in mice aren’t the same as tests in humans. </p>



<p>If
it does work in people, the treatment has potential “to buy those patients many
hours before the onset of really serious symptoms,” Casewell says. </p>



<p>The
team plans to run a safety trial in sub-Saharan Africa — one of the areas where
viper bites exact a heavy toll — before giving the pill to actual snakebite
victims. Previous trials of the drug before its use as a heavy metal poisoning
treatment were conducted exclusively in white European men, so the safety trial
is needed to reveal unforeseen side effects in an untested population, Casewell
says. </p>



<p>Even
if all goes well, Casewell notes that “this isn’t a single cure-all.” The
treatment may do little, if anything, for bites from snakes such as cobras
whose toxins predominantly target nerves instead of blood. Ultimately, he envisions
pairing the pill with other drugs that inhibit more of the major toxins in
snake venom, creating a universal snakebite pill. </p>



<p>That
kind of accessible, first aid measure is “reasonable to expect … within the
next few years,” Boyer says. But the next challenge will be to get the drug
into the hands of those who need it most, who are often rural and poor, she
says. “It won’t help at all to have a pill that minimizes the damage from
snakebite if you don’t have the pill nearby.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/STefmaHkhck/">What are your priorities for data sharing?</a></h4>

<p><em>This blog was written by <span lang="EN-US">Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, </span><span lang="EN-US">Publisher, Open Research, PLOS.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been working to identify important problems faced by researchers in the practice of open research. And, to deepen understanding of researchers’ priorities with regards to sharing research data, we’ve launched a new study. If you are a researcher residing in the US or Europe who has shared or reused research data please </span><a href="http://sgiz.mobi/s3/PLOS-Research-Data-Survey?S=B"><b>take a few minutes to take part in the survey</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the survey will also help determine if and how well researchers’ needs are met by existing tools and services for sharing research data, and inform future PLOS initiatives and partnerships – beyond the publication of open access journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers’ experiences and attitudes about sharing research data are arguably already well studied. The annual </span><a href="https://www.digital-science.com/resources/portfolio-reports/the-state-of-open-data-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of Open Data reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Digital Science, and </span><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9056-8251"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Tenopir’s research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are valuable, recurring examples. And a bibliography of studies we’ve read, or re-read, recently is included below </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1–24]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why do we need another survey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the results of numerous studies, researchers’ concerns about misuse and scooping are amongst the most common concerns about, or barriers to, data sharing. These concerns are followed, in their frequency, by the more practical concerns about copyright and licensing (ownership) and the time and effort required to make research (data) openly available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In principle there are numerous solutions available for some of the problems, barriers and concerns represented by these findings – from repositories, institutional research support, training programmes, to journal policies and procedures. Yet in practice — to give one example of assumed good practice in open research — today only </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about a fifth of researchers use repositories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to share data supporting published papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having reviewed this prior research and having spoken with different groups of researchers ourselves in the last few months, we’ve concluded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is considerable evidence for various cultural and practical concerns with sharing of research data, and growing evidence of how sharing and reusing data can benefit research, the economy and researchers’ careers. But, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are less certain about how </span><b>important </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">each of these problems are, and if and </span><b>how well existing tools, products, and services help solve these problems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data sharing, research data, and open data are very important at PLOS — reflected in our long-standing policies on data sharing. But there is more that we can do to enable research data sharing and reuse, which may help realise more of its benefits. We expect that this study will help identify researchers’ priorities, which in turn will guide our priorities for new initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re very grateful for any time researchers can lend to completing the survey and, naturally, we plan to share data from the survey publicly in the future.</span></p>

<p>Much of the discourse surrounding mental health over the last few years has focused on stigma: breaking down those unhelpful myths around mental illness that both prevent people seeking help and, sometimes, lead to outright discrimination.</p>
<p>What part culture has to play in this mission is an interesting question. Both the “madman” and the asylum have been a ubiquitous presence in cinema, literature and television, often to the chagrin of those who have had such stereotypes directly affect their lives. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2764842?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=042420">new study</a>, published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>, has looked at the impact one recent film, <em>Joker</em>, might have had on prejudice.<span id="more-39570"></span></p>
<p>The film is a gritty retelling of the origin story of Batman’s nemesis, the Joker, inspired by classic 1970s cinema. Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is depicted as having unspecified mental health problems: after his medication supply is cut off, he goes on a violent rampage and becomes the antihero we know from the comics.</p>
<p>Whether or not the film was stigmatising was subject to great debate at time of release: in <em>T</em><em>he Guardian</em> a pair of doctors  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/21/joker-mental-illness-joaquin-phoenix-dangerous-misinformed">argued that the film perpetuated damaging stereotypes</a>, for instance, whilst another piece in the same paper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/27/joker-makes-great-disability-art-by-letting-its-hero-bite-back">described it as an authentic depiction</a> of someone misunderstood by an uncaring society.</p>
<p>To investigate whether watching the film influenced people’s attitudes towards those with mental illness, Damian Scarf from the University of Otago and colleagues held screenings of <em>Joker</em> for 84 participants and of <em>Terminator: Dark Fate, </em>a film with no depiction of mental illness, for 80 participants. Demographic data was taken for all participants, including whether or not they had personal experience of mental health problems.</p>
<p>Before and after both screenings, participants completed the Prejudice Toward People With Mental Illness (PPMI) scale, which gauges how much the respondent fears or avoids people with mental health problems, and how much they view them as unpredictable or malevolent .</p>
<p>Results suggested that watching the film did increase negative perceptions of mental illness. Participants watching <em>Joker</em> had a mean score of 2.99 before watching: this increased to 3.20 after having seen it. Those watching <em>Terminator: Dark Fate, </em>on the other hand, had a mean score of 2.91 before and 2.88 after watching the film. Unsurprisingly, those with a history of mental illness had lower PPMI scores across the board.</p>
<p>There were a few limitations to the research. Sample size was extremely small, to start: future research could look at a larger sample, and at a wider range of media. The study was also unable to probe how often prejudicial attitudes lead to tangibly discriminatory behaviour towards people with mental health problems: though discriminatory behaviours are included in the PPMI scale, self-reporting such behaviours may not be a fully accurate way of linking perceptions and related actions.</p>
<p>No matter what you think of <em>Joker</em> itself, it’s hard to deny that cinema hasn’t always been kind to mentally ill people, whether that’s in schlocky asylum-based horror films or in less antagonistic but intensely pitying alternatives. As society tries to leave stigma behind, however, it may be time for the stereotypes to be retired completely in favour of the richly drawn and complex narratives that are truly deserved.</p>

<p>A study by <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01822-9">Ma <em>et al.,</em></a> published this week in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a>, sought to examine the predicative role of the AACS for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and mortality in PD patients.  This study was a single-center, prospective, cohort study utilizing lateral lumbar radiography to determine the AACS for 292 PD patients.  The patient population had a median PD duration of 28.4 months.  One-fourth of patients had a history diabetes and one-third had a history of cardiovascular disease.  The average AACS was 2.0.  The patients enrolled were categorized into tertiles of low (meaning AACS = 0), medium (meaning AACS = 1-4) and high (meaning AACS &gt; 4). The duration of follow-up averaged 43.6 months and there were 65 MACCE and 84 deaths.  It was noted that the AACS was associated with age, PD duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.  Ma <em>et al.</em> observed that there was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MACCE and all-cause mortality in the upper AACS tertile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?  I might strongly consider starting.  An x-ray is a low cost, noninvasive test that could potentially help with risk stratification.  Those patients with a high AACS should have immediate referrals to cardiology for cardiovascular disease prevention and evaluation.  The frequency of testing and the initiation of testing would need to be clarified. Additionally, there is a potential use in kidney transplantation evaluations.  Many transplant centers utilize a non-contrast CT as part of the transplant work-up addressing the site of anastomosis.  Findings often prompt further cardiovascular disease testing.  These CT results could help triage those who needed more extensive testing.  Those with a high AACS might need to go directly to cardiac catheterization for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Whereas those with a low AACS might go directly to a stress test or coronary CT.  This stratification could eliminate unnecessary testing, prevent complications, and save money.</p>
<p>The more passive approach would be using the information when abdominal aortic calcification is incidentally found.  Then patients could proceed to a cardiology referral or further testing.  However, in this population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, I would tend to take a more active role in prevention.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-closest-earth-may-have-been-spotted">The closest black hole to Earth may have been spotted 1,000 light-years away</a></h4>

<p>The closest black hole to the
solar system ever spotted may be just 1,000 light-years away. This newfound dark
neighbor is at least 4.2 times as massive as the sun, and lives with two ordinary
stars whose funny orbits <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202038020">gave
the black hole’s presence away</a>,
astronomers report May 6 in <em>Astronomy
&amp; Astrophysics</em>.</p>



<p>Astronomers expect the Milky Way to harbor between 100 million and a billion black holes with masses between a few and 100 times the sun’s. But most of those black holes are invisible. “If it’s lonely out there without a companion, you’ll never find it,” says astrophysicist Thomas Rivinius of the European Southern Observatory in Santiago, Chile.</p>



<p>The few dozen small black
holes that have been spotted so far interact violently with their environments,
gobbling up gas from a companion star and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dozen-new-black-holes-found-milky-way-center">heating the gas until it emits X-rays</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/18</em>). The previous nearest known black
hole, called V616 Mon, emits X-rays from about 3,200
light-years away.</p>



<p>The new neighbor black hole,
called HR 6819, is not actively eating and so is invisible, the researchers say.
But it appears to have two companions: one star that the black hole orbits
every 40 days that is heavier and hotter than the sun as well as a more distant,
massive star orbiting the star-black hole pair that is rotating so fast that it’s
almost breaking apart. The motions of those two stars first suggested something
weighing at least four solar masses must be orbiting with them, unseen.</p>





<p>“We would have seen it if it
was a normal star,” Rivinius says. “If it’s not a normal star, the only thing
it can be otherwise is a black hole.” HR 6819 is near enough and its stars are
bright enough that on a dark, clear night in the Southern Hemisphere, the stars
can be seen with the naked eye, the scientists say. </p>



<p>There could be many other unseen
black holes of similar mass in the Milky Way, says ESO astronomer Marianne
Heida, who is based in Garching, Germany. “It would be a little bit too
convenient, if there’s only one in the Milky Way, that it’s right next door,”
she says.</p>



<p>Rivinius and his colleagues first
spotted the black hole by accident more than 15 years ago. A team led by Stanislav
Štefl, then of ESO in
Santiago, observed the system in 2004 as part of a study of fast-spinning pairs
of stars. The team suspected there might be a third, invisible object locked in
an orbital dance with the two visible stars. </p>



<p>But in 2014, before the team
could publish the observations, <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.156-jun14/messenger-no156-60-60.pdf">Štefl died in a car accident</a>. “I consider this part of his legacy, this work,”
Rivinius says.</p>



<p>The team picked the research
back up after another black hole, called LB-1, was reported in November 2019.
That black hole appears to be orbiting a more ordinary star, and seems <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-black-hole-milky-way-is-weirdly-heavy">weirdly heavy</a>,
about 68 times the mass of the sun (<em>SN: 11/27/19</em>). But Rivinius’ team
thinks that, like HR 6819, it’s probably a smaller black hole with two companion
stars instead.</p>



<p>It’s possible that both HR 6819 and LB-1 are more ordinary than they appear, says astrophysicist J.J. Eldridge at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. She thinks that instead of a black hole, the systems could involve a third massive star with a disk around it. Because of the way that the observations are made and the complexity of the objects’ orbits, “it would be really, really difficult to disentangle,” she says. “The interpretation of a black hole is more interesting, but also may not be correct.”</p>

About <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html">30 percent</a> of older adults in the U.S. live on incomes that are near the poverty threshold and about <a href="https://paa2012.princeton.edu/papers/121818">one third</a> of older adults in the U.S. report financial strain, meaning they have difficulty making ends meet. Importantly, financial challenges are modifiable social determinants of health that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Older adults facing financial challenges may find it difficult to meet basic needs. They may run out of food or medications near the end of the month when funds run low. They may not be able to afford housing that is properly heated or that meets their needs to safely age in place in their own homes. In addition to lacking basic necessities, individuals face greater day-to-day stress managing household finances. There is good evidence that older adults facing financial challenges are more likely to become disabled and die earlier than their wealthier peers.</p>

We compared four different measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial strain, education, and professional occupation) to see which of these predicted new cases of dementia.</p>
<p>In our study, older adults who experienced either low income or financial strain were more likely to develop dementia than those who didn’t. Education, which has already been linked to dementia in other studies, predicted dementia in our study as well. In fact, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31363-6/fulltext"><em>The Lancet</em> Commission on Dementia</a> identifies low education as a key dementia risk factor. However, when we compared education to income and financial strain we found similar results for all three socioeconomic measures. This suggests that low income and financial strain may be just as important as low education with regard to risk of dementia.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11868 aligncenter" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/figure-300x124.png" width="510" />
<p>These results are important because financial challenges may actually be more modifiable for older adults than education. Most adults complete their educational training early in life, but financial challenges could be addressed at any point in the life course.</p>
<p>Many programs and policies are already in place that are intended to support older adults facing financial challenges. Public benefits, entitlement programs, and tax credits may alleviate financial challenges. However, these programs are often under-utilized. For example, the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides money to buy food but only about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/charts/snap-participation-rates/">40 percent</a> of eligible older adults use the program.</p>
<p>Results from this study complement results of <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1340-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">another study</a> our team published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a> last year, which highlighted the importance of housing quality for financially strained older adults. In that study, we used the same national sample of U.S. older adults to track changes over time in both financial strain and markers of home disorder such as tripping hazards, pests, or broken furniture and flooring. We also tracked mobility over the same time period.</p>
<blockquote><p>Efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults.</p></blockquote>
<p>In that study, financial strain and home disorder interacted with each other over time – financial strain predicted more home disorder and home disorder predicted greater financial strain. Importantly, both financial strain and home disorder predicted mobility limitations among older adults, suggesting that both play a role in functional decline. These results suggest that older adults with financial strain may slip into a downward spiral of worsening home conditions and worsening financial strain that leads eventually towards disability.</p>
<p>These results highlight the importance of early intervention to alleviate financial strain in order to prevent disability for healthy older adults. Also, these results suggest that interventions should include improving home conditions for financially strained older adults, which may break the link between financial strain and disability.</p>
<p>Together, these two studies add to a growing body of evidence linking financial challenges, including low income and financial strain, with poor health outcomes for older adults. As populations age around the world, we should pay greater attention to supporting older adults facing modifiable financial challenges. Our research suggests that efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults. Existing resources for food, housing, and health care supports should be strengthened to meet the growing needs of populations aging with financial challenges.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/alcohol-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Whether we are meeting friends in a bar, eating out, or planning a night in at home, one of our first thoughts is often: ‘What shall I drink?’. The choice in bars, restaurants and supermarkets is often overwhelming, with long menus, details of tasting notes, and special offers to review. The one consistent feature is that alcohol is everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018#data-sets">In England</a>, the majority of adults drink alcohol, and around half do so every week. While the risk of harm remains low for many people, 1 in 3 men and 1 in 7 women drink above the current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-consumption-advice-on-low-risk-drinking">UK low-risk drinking guidelines</a> (14 units/week). This <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/">increases the risk</a> of developing alcohol-related illnesses, including mouth, throat and breast cancers, stroke and heart disease.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11865 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/drinks-2578446_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Making alcohol less affordable is one way to reduce consumption <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616324205">effectively</a>. However, we are interested in other potential approaches. Specifically, we were interested in whether changing the drinking <em>environment</em> could influence drinking behavior.<a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012573.pub3/abstract"> Previous research</a> has shown that people are more likely to buy and eat healthier food if a proportion of less healthy meal or snack options are replaced with healthier options. Our study investigated whether altering the availability of non-alcoholic compared to alcoholic drink options would similarly impact people’s choices.</p>
<p>We asked 808 adult weekly beer drinkers to take part in an online study. They were asked to choose 1 drink, that they would like to have today, from a display of both non-alcoholic (soft drinks and alcohol-free beer) and alcoholic (beer) options. They were shown 1 of 4 possible drink displays that either had the same proportion of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks (2 of each, or 4 of each), or a higher or lower proportion of non-alcoholic drinks (6 non-alcoholic and 2 alcoholic, or 2 non-alcoholic and 6 alcoholic).</p>
<p>In real-world environments – such as a supermarket or busy bar – people often have to make quick choices about which drink they choose. Therefore, we also asked half of the drinkers to make their choice under a high time pressure.</p>
<blockquote><p>The odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that the odds of drinkers choosing a non-alcoholic drink were 71% higher when both the total number of drinks and proportion of non-alcoholic options were increased, and 48% higher when the proportion of non-alcoholic options was increased. There was no evidence that increasing the number of non-alcoholic drinks increased their selection when the proportion of drink types remained the same. There was no evidence that giving drinkers a time limit affected the type of drink they chose.</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, this is the first evidence to suggest that interventions to increase the availability of non-alcoholic drinks – particularly their proportion relative to alcoholic drinks – could support a reduction in alcohol selection.</p>
<p>Although many bars and restaurants offer at least one type of alcohol-free beer, this is often kept in the fridge behind the bar, or at the back of a menu, and the range of non-alcoholic drinks is often <a href="http://nudgingpubs.uk/pubs-and-bars-are-constrained">limited</a>. These alcohol alternatives lack visibility and it requires greater effort for customers to choose them. However, the market for these drinks is <a href="https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2019/05/20/How-much-has-the-no-alcohol-category-grown">growing</a>, which is providing greater choice, and over time, increasing exposure to non-alcoholic drinks could help shift social norms around drinking these products.</p>
<p>Interventions to increase the proportion of non-alcoholic drinks available are timely and of interest not only to policy makers, but also license holders and drinks manufacturers. Research in real-world settings is needed now to understand the potential impact on alcohol consumption.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-otters-juggle-rocks-is-still-mystery">Why otters ‘juggle’ rocks is still a mystery</a></h4>

<p>A lovely, intuitive idea
about why otters juggle rocks — that it helps them practice survival skills — might
not be correct, new tests show.</p>



<p>The term “juggling” is itself
overenthusiastic. Otters don’t keep stones flying around in some tall, aerial
circle. Instead, the animals shuffle rocks back and forth quickly between their
front paws. “It’s very close to the body,” says animal behaviorist Mari-Lisa
Allison, who studied the behavior as a graduate student at the University of
Exeter in England.</p>



<p>Such deft fiddling looks as
if it might make a great example of how animal play could serve as practice for
real-life challenges. In the wild, small-clawed otters need paw dexterity to tweak
shreds of seafood out of crustacean or mollusk shells. And yet, three kinds of tests
<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200141">found no evidence that juggling builds otters’ food-picking
skills</a>, Allison and her colleagues
report May 6 in <em>Royal Society Open
Science</em>.</p>



<p>The question of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kids-play-fantasy-reality">how play evolved</a> (<em>SN: 2/6/18)</em> has long fascinated
biologists. According to the latest thinking, play behaviors serve no immediate
practical need. Yet even the mild tussles of puppies and kittens take energy
and carry some risk of injury, so it seems that some benefit must counterbalance
those downsides. </p>





<p>Asian small-clawed otters (<em>Aonyx cinerea</em>), the littlest of the 13
otter species, are “very playful,” Allison says. Smooth-coated otters (<em>Lutrogale perspicillata</em>) also juggle
rocks but eat fish that don’t require deft plucking of food tidbits from shells.</p>



<p>Because the otters eat in
different ways, Allison originally predicted that the active paws of the shellfish
eaters in three wildlife collections would surpass the simple fish grabbers in their
skill at pulling bits of meat out of crevices. Regardless of their differences
in feeding styles, however, both kinds of otters proved equally able to winkle
some meat out of challenging objects. Rock play didn’t seem to matter in
learning a life skill.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>What’s called “juggling” in otters means quickly switching pebbles from paw to paw close to the chest. A new study points out that Asian small-clawed otters in zoos and wildlife parks do this most often as the thrill of feeding time approaches. What the species does in the wild is not clear.</figure>



<p>Allison and colleagues tested
both species by tucking minced meat into three kinds of inconvenient and
unfamiliar containers: plastic medicine bottles with screw-on caps, pierced
green tennis balls and toys resembling clamshells made of two oversized
Lego-like blocks. (Real Lego blocks, she worried, were small enough to become a
choking hazard for the otters.) </p>



<p>Especially frequent rock-twiddling
among the small-clawed otters, however, didn’t give individuals a noticeable
edge in working tidbits out of awkward containers. Instead, the study linked
surges of rock juggling to the approach of feeding time, with more juggling as
lunch drew nigh. </p>



<p>Also, it wasn’t just
youngsters that played with rocks: Elderly otters past reproductive age
likewise did a lot of paw fiddling. So, again, juggling may not be only a way
for youngsters to practice skills for feeding.</p>



<p>The possible disconnect
between play and real-life skills doesn’t startle Gordon Burghardt of the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Over decades, he has analyzed play
behavior, refining definitions and even reporting play in such unexpected animals
as a turtle <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1098-2361(1996)15:3%3C223::AID-ZOO3%3E3.0.CO;2-D">romping with a basketball</a> in a zoo. The thinking about the evolution of play
has by now expanded beyond simple notions of the benefits of instinctive practice,
he says. </p>



<p>Play is more likely to evolve,
Burghardt has pointed out, among animals with parental care that give
youngsters enough surplus food and a safe space for goofing around. He calls
this the “surplus resource” hypothesis, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/its-hard-being-sea-otter-mom">otters are a good example of it</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/14</em>).
Otters that juggle may be doing so “for pleasure, out of boredom, or both,” he
says. Either way, he says, they’re drawing on “part of their evolutionary
heritage.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-college-students-social-belonging-intervention">A simple exercise on belonging helps black college students years later</a></h4>

<p>A simple, one-hour exercise that helps black students feel
like they belong in college can pay off. Even a decade later, students who took
the training <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/eaay3689">reported
higher levels of personal and professional satisfaction</a> than their peers.</p>



<p>The
findings, reported April 29 in <em>Science
Advances</em>, indicate that benefits from a “social-belonging” intervention endure,
says Christopher Rozek, an education researcher at Stanford University who was
not involved with this study. Though the study is small, involving a few dozen
graduate students from a single university, Rozek says the findings are
exciting. “It is the first really long-term follow-up with this sort of
intervention.” </p>



<p>Black
students entering college, who are aware of negative racial stereotypes and are
underrepresented in higher education, can experience uncertainty about
belonging, says study coauthor Shannon Brady, a social psychologist at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. That uncertainty can cause some black students
to see commonplace challenges — a bad grade or a spat with a friend — as a
confirmation of those negative feelings. Consequently, such students become
less likely to seek help when needed, which can hurt their academic performance
and overall well-being. Social-belonging interventions aim to break that
negative loop. </p>



<p>In
the early to mid-2000s, researchers recruited 92 college freshmen – split
almost evenly between black and white students — at a selective East Coast university.
Forty-three students in one group read partially fictionalized vignettes from a
diverse group of upperclassmen describing how their sense of belonging at
school increased over time. The upperclassmen emphasized their efforts to reach
out to professors and classmates for help. Participants then wrote an essay reflecting
on their own experiences. The 49 students in the control group also read
vignettes and wrote an essay, but learned about how upperclassmen adjusted to physical
challenges, such as navigating campus and bad weather. </p>





<p>The first indication that the intervention helped longer
term came at graduation: Black students in the intervention group had <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6023/1447">higher grade point
averages</a> than black students in the control group, the researchers reported
in 2011. And these students had halved the racial achievement gap in GPA between
white and black students in the study. In an earlier pilot project, the
researchers had also shown that black students who received the intervention
became more likely <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17201544">to
attend office hours and e-mail professors for help</a>. The intervention did not affect outcomes for white students.</p>



<p>Now,
Brady and colleagues show black students in the intervention group continued to
see benefits after graduation. The researchers tracked down 80 of the original
92 participants. In an online survey, respondents, average age 27, were asked
to rate their potential to succeed in the future relative to other students in
their graduating class. Black participants in the intervention group rated their
potential to succeed as the same or above 69 percent of their peers; blacks in
the control group said they expected to do better than 53 percent. Those in the
intervention also rated their life satisfaction one point higher on average on
a seven-point scale. </p>



<p>And
almost 70 percent of black participants who received the intervention reported
holding a community leadership position — a sign of a continued sense of
belonging — compared with 35 percent of black participants in the control
group. </p>



<p>These
differences could not be explained by the intervention group’s higher grades, or
even directly by the original one-hour exercise itself, as few participants
recalled it. Instead, the researchers found a statistical link between those successes
and securing a mentor in college: Eighty-four percent of black students in the
intervention group had such a relationship; only 43 percent of black students
in the control group did.  </p>



<p>The
initial intervention appears to have triggered a snowball effect. “Having that
different lens on the world leads you to take different actions and very likely
end up with a different [life] experience,” Brady says.   </p>



<p>Looking
ahead to next fall, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic could make it harder for
marginalized students to find their footing, especially if classes are offered
remotely, Brady says. In previous work, though, she and colleagues showed that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/24/E3341">social-belonging interventions
can be delivered online</a> with positive, though slightly weaker, results in
students’ first year of college. More than 50 colleges and universities use an
online version of the program. </p>



<p>Even
if classes are taught online, colleges can still facilitate virtual relationships
between students and faculty, Brady says. “These relationships seem to be
really, really important.”  </p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>Photo: A child looks at a Darth Vader mask at an exhibition in the Louvre, Paris, in 2015. Credit: Chesnot/Getty Images</em></p>
<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Watching <em>Return of the Jedi</em> with my kids the other night, I found myself quite liking Darth Vader. After all, he’s<em> s</em>elf-disciplined, determined, conscientious, and uncompromising — while also being (almost) entirely evil…</p>
<p>It’s no secret that we can <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/02/can-evolutionary-psychology-explain-why-we-love-to-hate-evil-villains/">find fictional villains fascinating</a>. It’s been argued that that’s because we are evolutionarily drawn to understanding bad guys, as well, of course, to seeing the good guys prevail. But <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620909742">new research</a>, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, suggests that this is not the full story.</p>
<p><span id="more-39564"></span>In real life, we do tend to like people who are similar to us in positive ways — who are also conscientious, say, or agreeable. But research has found that we recoil from others who are similar to us in positive ways but possess antisocial traits, too — they’re intelligent but deeply manipulative, for instance. This is thought to be because it’s uncomfortable for us to see any similarities between ourselves and “bad” people.</p>
<p>Rebecca Krause and Derek Rucker at Northwestern University wondered if the same was true when it came to <em>fictional</em> characters, who may not pose the same potential threat to our self-image.</p>
<p>To explore this, the pair first analysed data from a company called CharacTour, an entertainment website with more than 230,000 registered users at the time of the study. CharacTour staff had identified thousands of characters as villains (such as Maleficent and the Joker) and as heroes (such as Sherlock Holmes and Yoda) and sidekicks. They had also used scales to rate these characters on mini-spectrums for various traits — from chatty to reserved and highbrow to lowbrow, for example. Users could also rate themselves on these traits, using the same scale, and become “fans” of characters they were most drawn to.</p>
<p>Krause and Rucker found that characters with a higher score on any given trait tended to have a greater percentage of fans with that trait. Strikingly, the similarity effect was even stronger for villains than non-villains. The normal aversion that we feel towards similar, but bad, individuals had vanished.</p>
<p>The pair also found that villains and their fans didn’t share only positive traits. Compared with non-villains, villainous characters had a greater percentage of fans who rated themselves as dishonest, rude, manipulative and selfish. Fiction seemed, then, to free people to be drawn to the darker sides of our characters. (A finding that made me wonder which dark traits, exactly, I might share with Lord Vader…)</p>
<p>The pair then sought to firm up their findings, and dig into potential explanations, using a series of online studies.</p>
<p>The first, which involved 100 student participants, confirmed that it was more discomforting to be compared to a real-life villain than to a fictional one. Further work meanwhile supported the idea that fiction typically frees us from the threat of negative social comparisons — but not in all contexts. When a group of participants was told that they were “weirdly” similar to a “super-creepy” fictional villain in a new film, they reported being perfectly happy to watch the film while alone. But as an option for a first date, it became distinctly unappealing. First dates of course involve potentially important social judgements. The risk of being likened in any way to a “super-creepy” villain clearly represented a threat to those participants’ self-image.</p>
<p>But a first date is a special case. “Our research suggests that stories and fictional worlds can offer a ‘safe haven’ for comparison to a villainous character that reminds us of ourselves,” comments Krause. This can open us up to learning more about darker parts of the self that we don’t normally explore, the pair thinks.</p>
<p>Stories might not be the only way to mitigate threats to self-perceptions, they add. Having a secure attachment figure — someone who we know loves us — might also act to protect us from the discomfort caused by feeling at least partly similar to a morally undesirable person, perhaps.  “Although stories were used in the present approach, our findings invite a more general exploration of other factors that might mitigate threat and thus attract people toward comparison with similar but negative others,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>But, as they warn in their paper, there could be dangers here. If, for example, a person were to see a reality-TV star, say, as a “fiction-esque” and appealing villain, “this could have potentially sinister implications for people’s choice of role models.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/t0Eu8fG6yYw/">A Selfish Reason To Share Research Data</a></h4>

<p><em>This blog was written by</em> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giovanni Colavizza, Isla Staden, Kirstie Whitaker and Barbara McGillivray of the Alan Turing Institute and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS and first appeared on their <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/selfish-reason-share-research-data">website</a>.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of us adapt to the benefits of remaining connected with our peers and colleagues digitally, new evidence suggests that scholarly papers might get increased citations by staying digitally connected to the research data that support their results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote open, reproducible research, many journals have </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1629/uksg.463"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started to encourage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or even mandate that researchers share their research data and provide statements about the availability of their data in their published papers. These Data Availability Statements (DAS’s) in published papers (see Table for examples) provide a way to study if and how researchers share their data, and if data sharing correlates with citations of research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous studies have explored researchers’ data-sharing practices and their associations with citation counts in specific journals, or in specific research disciplines only. We analysed more than half a million papers across multiple journals and research disciplines, to explore the following questions: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are authors taking up the challenge of data sharing? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this beneficial for them as well as for the scientific community? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We analysed published articles from the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PubMed Open Access collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help answer these questions, and made all our </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3470062"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code and data available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for replication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an automated approach designed for the study, we classified different kinds of data availability statements, according to their main categories (illustrated in Table 1). The outcome is important as statements that contain a link to research data available in a public repository (category 3) are considered to be preferable over all other types of statements. However, depositing data in a repository may be more time-consuming for researchers than other approaches.</span></p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found that data availability statements are now very common in published papers. We also found that journal mandates to include these statements are effective, with big increases in the number of statements in 2014 and 2015, when </span><a href="https://plos.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Public Library of Science) and </span><a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BioMed Central), respectively, mandated them. When journals only encourage that authors provide a statement, only a small percentage of papers include them. In 2018 93.7% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Yet, </span><b>data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository are just a fraction of the total</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8% of PLOS publications and 12.2% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. Figure 1 gives an overview of data availability trends over time in PLOS journals, while Figure 2 exemplifies distinct approaches to data sharing from two BMC journals.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 1: Data availability statements over time in PLOS. The histogram shows the number of publications from specific subsets of the dataset and DAS categories: No DAS (0), Category 1 (data available on request), Category 2 (data contained within the article and supplementary materials), and Category 3 (a link to archived data in a public repository). The vertical solid line shows the date when a mandated DAS policy was introduced. </span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/BMC-graph.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43002" height="336" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/BMC-graph.png" width="993" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 2: Data availability statements over time in articles from the BMC Genomics journal (left; selected to illustrate a journal that had high uptake of an encouraged policy) and from the Trials journal (right; published by BMC, selected to illustrate a journal that has a very high percentage of data that can only be made available by request to the authors). The vertical solid line shows the date when a mandated DAS policy was introduced. A dashed line indicates the date an encouraged policy was introduced.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also find that </span><b>papers that link to data in a repository can have up to 25.36% (± 1.07%) higher citation impact on average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using a citation prediction model. While our results show that higher citations to a paper are correlated with linking to data in a repository, we cannot be certain this is the cause for the higher citations. However, this result may be encouraging for researchers, journals, publishers, funders and policymakers who are interested in data sharing and reproducible research. It suggests there might be a further incentive—beyond increasing transparency and reproducibility of results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to authors to make their data available using a repository.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be a variety of reasons for this effect. More efforts and resources are put into papers sharing data, thus this choice might be made for better quality articles. It is also possible that more successful or visible research groups have also more resources at their disposal for sharing data. Sharing data likely also gives more credibility to an article’s results, as it supports reproducibility. Finally, data sharing encourages re-use, which might further contribute to citation counts.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers are </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9980783.v2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there are insufficient resources and incentives to share their research data, and that more effort is required to publish data when publishing papers. However, this extra effort is really an investment rather than a cost. It is an investment in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.295"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more reliable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reusable research for the scientific community, and this new evidence suggests it could also be a reasonable, “selfish” investment in researchers’ own reputations. </span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Daydreaming about an ideal life, it can be easy to slip into fantasies about wealth <em>—</em> there’s a reason, after all, that “winning the lottery” is the ultimate dream for so many people. The <em>reality</em> of being rich, however, often doesn’t match that dream, with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/04/people-who-prioritise-time-over-money-are-happier/">some research</a> suggesting that people who prioritise time are much happier than those who prioritise money.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220910872">new study in the <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a> drives home the message that money really isn’t everything. The team finds that “financially contingent self-worth” <em>—</em> self-esteem based on financial success <em>—</em> can leave people feeling lonely and disconnected.</p>
<p><span id="more-39559"></span>Deborah Ward of the University at Buffalo and colleagues first asked 345 participants to rate themselves on various statements  related to financially contingent self-worth, such as “my self esteem is influenced by how much money I make” and “I feel bad about myself when I feel I don’t make enough money”. Next, participants reported how much they felt time pressures in their life, rating statements including “there are not enough minutes in the day” on a scale of one to seven.</p>
<p>Participants then estimated what percentage of time they spent being alone and with others (either working or socialising), and stated how often they felt lonely and isolated and how connected they felt to other people. The team also measured participants’ sense of autonomy <em>—</em> how much control and choice they felt they had in life.</p>
<p>As expected, participants whose self-worth was tied to their financial success reported feeling more time pressure <em>—</em> which, in turn, was related to greater feelings of social disconnection and loneliness. Participants’ sense of autonomy also partly accounted for this relationship: those whose self-worth was more financially contingent reported a lower sense of autonomy, which was related to worse social outcomes.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the same factors on a larger scale, with 940 participants completing the survey. Again, results suggested that financially contingent self-worth was associated with both lower autonomy and worse social outcomes; lower autonomy was also associated with spending less time with family and friends.</p>
<p>In a final study, 246 participants completed daily diary measures at home examining the same concepts as before; this time, however, participants reported how they’d felt or behaved <em>that day</em> rather than in general.</p>
<p>On days when participants reported particularly high financially contingent self-worth, both autonomy and social outcomes were far worse. Those who regularly reported high financially contingent self-worth were also more likely to report lower autonomy and worse social outcomes in general. These people also reported feeling more concerned about their finances.</p>
<p>We already knew that basing self-worth on financial achievements can have pretty negative consequences <em>—</em> financially contingent self-worth can lead to higher anxiety, increased feelings of pressure, and a higher likelihood of unfavourably comparing oneself to others.</p>
<p>The new study suggests that there are also social repercussions: if we believe money is the ultimate meaning of success, it makes sense that we’ll spend more time focusing on work than we will our relationships, that we’ll have less free time and that we’ll therefore feel less in control of our lives than we might want.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the data is correlational <em>—</em> the direction of cause and effect may not be as straightforward as this. But either way, if your self-esteem is financially contingent, working towards <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/29/people-who-try-to-be-environmentally-friendly-by-buying-less-stuff-are-happier-study-claims/">less materialistic</a> forms of validation may be a worthwhile long-term goal.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology/">A pandemic of boredom</a></h4>

<p>It was just the two of them: on a raft, lost, floating off the coast of Africa—the lone survivors of a shipwreck. Years before, struck with stupendous boredom, Hymie Basteshaw decided to become boredom’s master. He read what others wrote about boredom, studied its physiology, and discovered its secrets in the wavering folds of human cells. Mid-sea, he now shares with Augie March his first and “obvious” findings. Boredom is “the shriek of unused capacities, the doom of serving no great end or design, of contributing to no master force. The obedience that is not willingly given because nobody knows how to request it. The harmony that is not accomplished.” Basteshaw is but a minor character—a psycho-biologist, a carpenter, a genius, a “maniac”—in Saul Bellow’s long picaresque novel, <em>The Adventures of Augie March.</em> He offers not a minor or obvious feature of boredom, but a discerning appraisal of its intimate nature. Boredom, Basteshaw tells March, although not in these exact words, is hybrid, both personal and social.</p><p>Our current situation is one of crisis, of resources, values, and priorities. It’s also a crisis for the study of boredom. It’s a call to understand boredom both as a psychological and social phenomenon. If our aim is to capture what it means to experience boredom right now—the boredom of social distancing, quarantine, and the pandemic—we can’t rely exclusively on lessons that we’ve drawn from willing participants in on-line or in-person studies. Yes, we are bored with more or less the same things that previously bored us. But we are bored because of our newfound and newly imposed social condition. In social distancing, we find ourselves in an unusual position. Both restrained and acutely aware of the meaninglessness of our everyday actions we are under the threat of a new boredom—a boredom that looks and feels just like our ordinary boredom, but which has grown out of a much different and more fertile ground.</p><p>What is boredom most fundamentally? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-017-9515-1">Boredom</a> is an unpleasant state that signals to us the presence of an unsatisfactory situation and which, at the same time, contains a strong desire to do something else. During boredom, we feel both <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02497.x?casa_token=_BCyupis9P0AAAAA:H6yd-UBkp3cjgUwfzp3lxDYk8FMAuT0r0vSbJQmW9VoQewZqlo17-H-V5tZGMHatenq63d23ysmtQw">frustrated and listless</a>. We’re disengaged from and dissatisfied with what we do. Our situation doesn’t hold our <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612456044?casa_token=StKmthlMIE4AAAAA%3ATtU3bwoycH54kqiCpwnOM2q2cGhirea80YUGx5oJcjvhJxw24NxB3PQsb5vUTwU91716zdieELpW">attention</a>. It doesn’t interest us and doesn’t strike us as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">meaningful</a>. In a state of boredom, we’re moved to think of alternative situations and goals, ones that are more interesting, engaging, and meaningful to us than our current ones. We itch to leave boredom behind and are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/books/edition/Propelled/MG0lzQEACAAJ?hl=en">propelled to try to do just that</a>.</p><p>Boredom is a problem—a disruption of agency, a deficit of meaning, or a block in our ability to engage cognitively and satisfactorily with our situation at hand. And yet, it’s also a solution. Or better, it’s the promise of a solution. The unpleasantness of boredom, along with its effects on our psychological processes and behavior, offers us a possible way out. Boredom is that disagreeable reminder that we should be doing something other than what we are currently doing. It’s also a repellent force, a drive that could, under the right conditions, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2017.1346240">allow us to overcome our discontent</a>.</p><p>What I have just described sounds a lot like a psychological state that exists in a social vacuum, but that isn’t so. Boredom can arise out of a perceived dissatisfaction with our situation, a mismatch between our wishes and reality, or even a lack of sufficient engagement with the task at hand. All of these prompts of boredom can be both personal and social. Any social condition that either begets or supports them would be one that promotes boredom.</p><p>We are currently experiencing a change in social order. Compared to our recent past, the present of the pandemic is one characterized by excessive order. Out of necessity, caution, concern, or fear, we are constrained. There’re real and tangible limits to our opportunities and obstacles to free action. And so, out of this new social order, boredom grows. “Boredom arises when we must not do what we want to do, or must do what we do not want to do,” psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-00161-018">once observed</a>. In <em>Melancholy and Society</em>, German sociologist Wolf Lepenies warned us of how socially frustrated agency is a fertile ground for boredom. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2010-15712-001">Experimental studies</a> agree that conditions over which individuals have little control can give rise to boredom. And <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820v2">a recent study</a> examining the attitudes of people living in quarantine in Italy appears to confirm it.</p><p>There’s another element of our social condition that contributes to the rise of boredom. Boredom is related not just to the perceived control or autonomy that we have over a situation but also to how meaningful our situation strikes us. Studies report that perceived meaninglessness is both a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">component</a> of and a likely <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2009.28.3.307">antecedent</a> to boredom. While social distancing, we often feel that our actions and activities are lacking in meaning. Why? In the face of the pandemic, our everyday activities seem insignificant. For those of us who are not nurses, doctors, first respondents, essential workers, or actively involved in helping others or fighting the spread of the virus, our actions seem to have little effect on the situation.</p><p>When faced with the boredom of the pandemic it helps to bring to mind the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01245/full">function</a> of boredom. It offers us a productive way to think about our boredom, for it underlines its existential import. We are fortunate not for this or that experience of boredom, but for the capacity to experience boredom. Boredom—in its non-chronic form—is a valuable tool and perhaps now, more than ever, a privilege. It’s both an affective reminder that we are stuck with ourselves and a call to become more than what we are right now.</p><p>But boredom can only do so much. Once it has made itself known to us, we are on our own. We have to decide how to act and what to do. We can turn to diversions or reflection, act rashly or prudently, give up or stand up, help others or look after ourselves. The possible outcomes of boredom are many and varied.New habits, opportunities, and careers often start with the thought “I am bored.” But so can unhealthy eating habits, binge drinking, drug use, or even <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/09/boredoms-push/">destruction</a>.</p><p>One hopes that in times like these boredom’s call can be put into productive and compassionate use. To borrow Voltaire’s words, one hopes that we can cultivate our garden: the ground out of which our personal and social existence can grow and flourish—not as an act of quietism but as a sign of resilience and as way to realize change.</p><p>It’s worth a try, even if it is done out of boredom.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@rhett_noonan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rhett Noonan</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dark-bedroom?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/">A pandemic of boredom</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622979590/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/confronting-mortality-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Confronting mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/music-schools-respond-to-covid-19-shutdown/" rel="nofollow">Music schools respond to COVID-19 shutdown</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-the-covid-19-pandemic-feels-like-a-movie/" rel="nofollow">Why the COVID-19 pandemic feels like a movie</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>One of our most popular posts here at <em>Research Digest </em>looked at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/">whether we all hear an inner voice while reading</a> (spoiler: most of us do <em>—</em> but 10% or so seem not to). Now researchers have found that readers aren’t the only ones to hear voices: authors themselves do as well. </strong>Almost two-thirds of authors surveyed at the Edinburgh book festival reported hearing their characters speaking while they were writing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/majority-of-authors-hear-their-characters-speak-finds-study">reports Alison Flood</a> at <em>The Guardian.</em><span id="more-39552"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Researchers have traditionally thought of autistic people as having “social deficits” when it comes to expressing emotion <em>—</em> but this ignores the fact that communication is a two-way street, </strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/research-on-facial-expressions-challenges-the-way-we-think-about-autism-134053">write Connor Tom Keating and Jennifer Cook</a> in <em>The Conversation</em>. Instead, their research suggests that autistic and neurotypical people use different facial expressions, and it is this mismatch between the two groups that can lead to difficulties in conveying or understanding emotion. “This is really crucial as it takes the element of blame away from the autistic person and instead proposes that these difficulties are a product of autistic and neurotypical differences,” the pair writes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Autism research is also often conducted without any input from people who are actually autistic. </strong>That’s beginning to change, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/autistic-voices-should-be-heard-autistic-adults-join-research-teams-shift-focus-studies?rss=1">reports Emily Willingham at <em>Science</em></a>: teams are increasingly including autistic researchers and focusing on studies that can improve the lives of autistic people, rather than searching for a cause or “cure”.</p>

<p><strong>At <em>Discover Magazine</em>, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/do-peer-reviewers-prefer-significant-results">Neuroskeptic reports</a> on a study providing further evidence that reviewers are more likely to accept psychology publications that report positive results. </strong>Researchers gave 127 reviewers for a media psychology conference an abstract that either reported a significant or non-significant finding.

<p><strong>As the lockdown continues, many of us have been left with a strange sense of time, with days seeming to blend together. </strong>That could have a negative impact on our later memory of this period, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/lockdown-distorting-memories-daily-landmarks-brains-false-memories">writes Julia Shaw at <em>The Guardian</em></a> (we also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/28/were-not-good-at-spotting-when-someone-has-a-false-memory-of-committing-a-crime/">covered Shaw’s work on false memories</a> this week). Shaw suggests staging memorable “landmark” events at home: new experiences which require a bit of effort to create and may be particularly interesting or emotional.</p>

<p><strong>Open Science Easing the Transition from Lab to e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of COVID19, the world is scrambling to figure out how to continue the functions of normal life while confined to a much smaller world of couches and home offices. Work, family and friend relationships, exercise, entertainment, and all the other elements of normalcy have been upended. The effort to maintain productivity (and, to be frank, sanity) has initiated a mass digital migration; a movement from life to e-life.</p>
<p>If you are a researcher you are likely dealing with your own unique micro-version of the predicament: how to continue working when you and your lab are self-isolated? In other words, how to replicate as many of the normal functions of a lab as possible in a digital environment; a movement from lab to e-lab.</p>
<p>Lab meetings have <a href="https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/covid19-zoom-lab-meeting/">migrated to video-conferencing</a> with relatively little friction; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00786-y">conferences have gone virtual astoundingly quickly</a>; manuscripts are being drafted and figures created – perhaps a tad earlier than originally planned; grants and proposals are being written. These are, however, only a small portion of what researchers do, and leave a huge swath of scientific work untouched and in stasis.</p>
<p>Those most able to continue useful work are those who, for whatever reason, have access to as much of their work as possible from home. Pictures of researchers lugging multiple work computers home in order to continue data analysis were common in the early days of the crisis.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42994" height="512" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-1.png" width="496" /></a></p>
<p>There is a subgroup of researchers, however, who can continue work without having to cram several computer towers into the trunk of a car: those who created an up-to-date digital, online representation of their research activities right up to the moment they had to be abandoned. These lucky few, who put in the time and effort to create a comprehensive e-lab prior to the crisis, are for the most part those who already commited to open science. This is, of course, no accident.</p>
<p><strong>Open Science and e-Labs</strong></p>
<p>Open science is, at its most practical base, the effort to (1) create an accurate and well organized digital representation of research activities and (2) share that representation with as few barriers as possible so others can effectively check, replicate, rework, reuse, and remix findings. Even the concentration within open science on sharing physical materials – like cell lines, biospecimens, and model organisms – is to enable replication and follow-on research when sharing the information about those materials does not to allow others to generate them themselves due to the unique nature of the material or an inability to make materials locally.</p>
<p>Researchers who have incorporated open, online sharing of research resources throughout their work – sharing experimental designs and protocols, lab notebooks, data, software, etc – have, in effect, created a digital representation of a significant portion of their activities that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>Not to oversell things, open sharing of research resources does not mean that researchers and labs can continue functioning without a hitch in their experimental stride. Much of the actual physical work has necessarily halted. It does mean, however, that many of the inputs to and outputs of their research are available in a digital form; accessible from a couch, desk, or apartment window-sill. While the emphasis from open science advocates in the past has been on ensuring that these digital representations exist so they can be shared, an added advantage has now jumped to the fore: the ability to share your e-lab with your quarantined-self.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Yourself</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-2.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42996" height="148" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-2.png" width="461" /></a></p>
<p>Labs that have, for example, stored experimental data immediately upon collection on open science platforms such as the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://www.synapse.org/">Synapse</a>, <a href="https://openneuro.org/">OpenNeuro</a>, and <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a> now have seamless access to the last bit collected before retreating into quarantine. Analyzing this data may be impossible if the requisite software only exists on a work computer, or you don’t have a license to use it at home; if, however, research software has been openly shared via a platform like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> then it can be accessed from a park bench (assuming a decent wifi signal).</p>
<p>If the collected data needs to be put into the context of how it was collected, perhaps to elicit input from other lab members about the best way to analyze it, there is no easier way than accessing the relevant protocols through <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or an <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/">Open Lab Notebook</a>. Need to know exactly what reagents or model organisms were used in an experiment? If one cannot go check the freezer, cage, or delivery invoice, then checking the relevant <a href="https://www.rrids.org/">Research Resource Identifier</a> (RRID) listed in your shared protocol or notebook is the next best (if not better) thing.</p>
<p>The list of unanticipated advantages continues. Perhaps you need to get input from a normally-down-the-hall colleague about how to improve your protocol for the future, or eliminate an artifact from some data, or iron out a persnickety bug in analysis software. In the lab you could invite them to pull up a chair as you took them through the issue. Now that is, obviously, impossible. If the protocol, data, or software were shared, however, you could email them the link (or, better yet, <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-">persistent identifier</a>), open a videochat window, and collaborate from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Your Research Community</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42997" height="379" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-3.png" width="467" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most heartening things I have seen while scrolling through my twitter-feed-turned-emotional-roller-coaster is that self-isolated researchers are engaging with openly shared research resources.</p>
<p>This is of course the case with COVID19 research, where openly shared software, data, manuscripts, and protocols relevant to the virus are being shared, collected, curated and adapted with blinding speed; but it goes farther than that. Every day I see someone in the neuroscience research community tweet something along the lines of “thank goodness for X piece of openly shared software/data that I can learn about and use from home!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-4.png"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-42998 aligncenter" height="1081" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-4.png" width="1059" /></a></p>
<p>When people are cut off from their physical labs and don’t have an e-lab of their own, it is wonderful to see them being able to pick up the tools and resources shared by others. The lessons we are being forced to learn about the fluidity, dynamism, and capacity for collective creativity enabled by sharing research resources will serve us well in the future.</p>
<p>My sincere hope is that those working with these new found tools and resources take the open ethos to heart and openly <em>reshare</em> any modifications, derived data, and new insights with the research community. Doing so closes the loop, creating a community-based feedback mechanism that encourages further sharing in the future and, more importantly, uses the expertise of the world-wide research community to create ever better science.</p>
<p><strong>Benefiting the Public and Less Well-off Researchers with an Open e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>Some of the people involved in shaping (see: arguing about) what open science is quail at the idea that open science has anything to do with equity and equality. They say that it is merely about replicability and transparency and that is it, harumph. What I hope this situation brings to light – as you swear at your institutional VPN for once again dropping you, or find yourself unable to download important papers because of paywalls your institutional account would normally breeze through – is that you are receiving a taste of what it is like outside the gilded ivory tower.</p>
<p>Such restrictions on access and use are what interested members of the public, or those at research institutes that cannot afford staggering subscription prices, or those in labs not well funded enough to pay for the licenses to fancy analysis software, face every day. The act of openly sharing a paper, a piece of software, a dataset, an equipment design, or whatever else is not just about replicability. Doing so is an act that expands the borders of science, allowing the participation of the previously excluded. It is an act of inclusion not in some abstract post-modern sense, but in the very real sense of choosing where and why to put the fences.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Open e-Lab with the World</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the fact that open sharing is useful to the isolated-sharer and their research community, shared research resources have taken on an unprecedented importance in the COVID19 crisis. Stories abound of how <a href="https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/covid-19-how-unprecedented-data-sharing-has-led-faster-ever-outbreak-research.html">sharing genetic sequences</a> and <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">protein structures</a> have led to the discovery of novel treatment targets, diagnostic testing protocols, and the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/record-setting-speed-vaccine-makers-take-their-first-shots-new-coronavirus">initiation of clinical trials</a> on a timescale that, in the pre-COVID19 era, would be unbelievable. Moreover, the rapid release of results via preprints has allowed the creation of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">competitions to apply machine learning</a> to generate yet more insights. Though similar mass sharing has occurred during previous outbreaks (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/plea-open-science-zika">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966">Ebola</a>), the fact that COVID19’s impact has been global (and, not to put too fine a point on it, has impacted the global north) holds the hope that this time it will stick.</p>
<p>There is no reason that the same strategies cannot be applied to the ongoing crises in neurological disorders, antibiotic development, and the treatment of rare diseases, to name only a few. Indeed, the kind of massive online collaboration to solve issues around testing, creating ventilators and personal protective equipment, solving protein structures, and identifying novel treatment targets in the context of COVID19 is <em>exactly</em> what open science advocates have been dreaming of for years.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to e-Labs and Global Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Open science has laid the groundwork for the creation of e-labs and for them to be linked up to enable global collaboration. The COVID19 crisis has, on so many levels, highlighted the importance and promise sharable, digital representations of research activity hold for the future of research. More people than ever are glimpsing the potential that e-labs interlinked into a global digital research ecosystem represents.</p>
<p>This bright future does not, however, come free of complications. Just as open science reveals the potential of sharing, it also reveals difficulties of coordination and consensus. If research is going to be conducted collaboratively on a global scale we need to make sure that shared resources are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (e.g. <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples">FAIR</a>). Doing so can be made easier through technology and sharing platforms, but what it requires most are education, communities collaboratively setting norms around standards and sharing practices, and a commitment to embed open science practices throughout the research lifecycle. The necessary changes in behaviour will require social and cultural innovation on the part of research communities at least as important as any technical advance.</p>
<p>Another big coordination problem has to do with eliminating research redundancies. Individual researchers within the global community need to coordinate so as to pursue different but complementary efforts. Doing so requires researchers to move past the stage of sharing resources in the hopes that those in their community will find it to engagement with that community. In the old, closed model such coordination was handled (albeit inefficiently) through journals and conferences where community members would be apprised of the work being done by others. The same task now must be undertaken in the digital world. Those of us interested in advancing open science are busily documenting how this is being done for COVID19 research in the hope that we can, after this is over, present an iron-clad case for how research communities can be rebuilt with digitally-mediated coordination planted deep in their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Making an Open Future to Benefit Everyone</strong></p>
<p>I would ask you to deeply consider how you can begin adopting open, collaborative, community based approaches in the future of your research, once the world is rightside-up again. Doing so isn’t just about some abstract idea of openness; it has real benefits for you, your lab, your research community, and the world. COVID is, it is true, producing never before seen destruction of research efforts from which many projects may never recover. Within this destruction, however, lay clues to how research can be remade better, more collaborative, more coordinated and, of course, more open.</p>

<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>
<p>Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is similar to learning new motor skills, for example learning to play tennis, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance. However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge to date.</p>
<p>The proposed project will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is being developed by the Biocomputation Research Group (biocomputation.herts.ac.uk) to optimise robotic rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm. This has led and is still leading to the development of a rapidly increasing number of computational models of cerebellar learning, and to the successful applications of these cerebellar models to controlling simulated and real robots. The PhD project will involve the development and application of personalised cerebellar models in order to optimise rehabilitation robots for individual subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Applicants</strong> should have excellent computational and numerical skills and a very good first degree in computer science, biology, maths, physics, neuroscience, or a related discipline. Successful candidates are eligible for a research studentship award from the University (GBP 15,285 per annum bursary plus payment of the student fees).

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>In basic terms, online status indicators convey availability: whether someone is on or offline, or when they last logged into a particular app. But if you’ve ever anxiously awaited a response from a prospective partner or suspected your friend might be ignoring you, you’ll be painfully aware of just how much weight that indicator can actually hold.</p>
<p>Now a new study has found that many users are not only aware of all that online status indicators can convey, but also change their behaviour accordingly. The research is <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/04/13/how-online-status-indicators-shape-our-behavior/">due to be published</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the 2020 ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>.<span id="more-39547"></span></p>
<p>Previous research has already shown that such indicators can inadvertently reveal a lot about our lives: <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/privacy-implications-of-presence-sharing-in-mobile-messaging-appl">one 2014 study</a> found that online status on WhatsApp was enough to identify daily routines, unusual messaging patterns, or even who users were talking to.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, Camille Cobb and her team recruited 200 participants to answer questions about their experiences with online status indicators. First, participants were presented with a list of 38 apps and asked to select those they use at least once a week. They were then asked a series of questions to gauge their familiarity with the design of status indicators and knowledge of how to control their visibility in apps.</p>
<p>Finally, participants were asked questions about their own experiences adjusting their visibility online (“is there anyone who would notice if you were offline for longer than usual?” or “have you ever changed your behaviour because you didn’t want to appear online?”) and behaviour towards others (“have you ever been surprised to notice that someone was online?” or “have you ever opened an app specifically to check if someone was online?”).</p>
<p>Use of apps with online status indicators was hugely common: 99% of participants reported regular use of at least one app with the feature, with Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger the most widely used.</p>
<p>Many participants wanted to control their online status, and had changed behaviour in order to do so: 23% had changed settings, 37% had avoided opening an app or quickly signed out to avoid a specific person, and three participants deleted an app from their phone altogether so that they didn’t appear “online”. This behaviour was usually aimed at a specific person: 43% had changed settings to avoid a particular person — often a current or former partner — versus just 25% who were trying to avoid people in general. Many stated that online status indicators had led them to feel under surveillance, aware that friends, partners or family members would be watching to see if or when they had signed in.</p>
<p>Checking for others’ online status was also prevalent: over half of participants said they had signed into or opened an app just to check somebody else’s status, and 41% said they had been “surprised” to see someone online, which in turn led to inferences about real-world behaviour and well-being and feelings around being ignored.</p>
<p>Online status indicators can be useful: as participants noted, they can be handy for working out when somebody might be available to chat or play a game, or knowing whether it might be better to message someone or call them instead. But the frequency with which participants anxiously checked others’ online status or sought to hide their own suggests that platforms should be offering better ways to meet user needs. Settings could be more transparent, for a start, or users could select not to appear online altogether — an option which many apps don’t yet offer.</p>
<p>Running into someone you really don’t want to see or speak to is an unfortunate fact of life, both on and offline: eliminating that altogether is probably unlikely to happen. But ensuring that users are able to adequately manage their online status may be something apps or messaging platforms could improve upon. Until then, it’s likely that online statuses will be a source of both community and anxiety.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Children who are victims of bullying often suffer a sense of helplessness. They don’t know what to do during bullying episodes and they don’t really believe anything will change or anyone can intervene effectively. Children subjected to bullying say it makes them feel sick, afraid, and helpless. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety, anger and depression. We know that as adults former victims can undergo similar feelings in the right circumstances.</p><p>Due to my research in the area of childhood bullying, I am contacted by many people about their own bullying incidents as children. They describe how they coped at the time. Often, they comment on how they’ve managed their lives in the wake of bullying.   The great majority have survived and gone on to live productive lives. However, during this world-wide COVID-19 crisis, adults relate that their mental state is similar to how they felt as children. I have received messages describing the reactivation of childhood memories of being captive to someone while feeling powerless.  In the face of the uncertainty generated by the coronavirus, the same emotions are rekindled: fear, anxiety, anger, and a certain amount of depression. While most are doing what they can in terms of preparedness and health precautions, helplessness is once again a prevailing emotion. Substance abuse held at bay has reemerged as a problem.</p><p>By this point, perhaps the majority of people are aware of a sense of helplessness while trying to outwait and outwit COVID-19 by using every best effort. It is a helpless feeling to see the numbers of deaths and to witness the struggles in the healthcare system. While everyone may feel some amount of anxiety related to the virus, survivors of bullying experience a heightened degree of fear, anxiety, and depression based on triggered childhood feelings. Helplessness is a familiar but unwelcome manifestation impacting their daily mood. Sheltering-in-place is difficult emotionally in general. But for victims of childhood bullying it is reminiscent of and activates the loneliness that was an everyday burden.</p><p>Trauma is an aspect of this health crisis. The loss of family and friends, and the fear of their loss, is overwhelming. Trauma results when such overwhelming stress exceeds one’s ability to cope. There are three distinct types of trauma: acute, chronic, and complex. Acute trauma describes what people are living through now, meaning the trauma is the result of a single event- the corona virus. Trauma can become chronic depending on the duration of an event; in this case how long people are required to shelter-in-place with all the problems attendant to that (loss of income, lack of childcare, family violence, etc.). Chronic bullying is traumatizing for children and it leads to changes in the brains’ ability to think clearly. At the very least, bullied children worry and their worries influence their actions. They try to hide and they learn to avoid their bullies. They often become worried, anxious adults. For those who endured bullying victimization as children, the trauma is complex. Those adults deal with childhood trauma and its effects in an ongoing way. Now they are dealing with the very personal nature of the fear of the virus as well.</p><p>Children can do very little when they are helpless. They don’t have the tools, the wisdom, the resources, or the maturity needed to ameliorate adverse childhood conditions. Adults by virtue of greater years, greater resources, and greater mental capacity are able, much of the time, to deal with difficult circumstances. But COVID-19 extracts its toll despite wisdom, years, or great resources. The virus is an equalizer in this respect. It exerts power over its victims. It is relentless in pursuing a host to control. It searches for any weakness to exploit. COVID-19 acts exactly like a bully. For those who have already been a victim in childhood, this new terror is another bully forcing people to stay inside hiding from its power. In this way, victims of childhood bullying, even with their adult resources, are revisited by an age-old sense of helplessness unique to them.</p><p>For adults intimidated and threatened throughout childhood, helplessness is not new. It has come back again in the shape of something even more powerful and intimidating.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@foxfox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Natalia Y</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/depression?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622804842/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-the-covid-19-pandemic-feels-like-a-movie/" rel="nofollow">Why the COVID-19 pandemic feels like a movie</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/confronting-mortality-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Confronting mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, April 29, at 9am Pacific</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Iowa State University Library and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue our support for Open Access publishing with PLOS under this new agreement,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communications and Collections at Iowa State University. “Preserving and growing the diversity of scholarly publishers has never been more important, and this agreement reaffirms our commitment to seeing that pure Open Access publishers like PLOS thrive.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Iowa State University Library will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. Iowa State researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS’ mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies.</p>
<p>“The agreement with Iowa State University Library is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreement with the University of California,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>One of the biggest political challenges of this era is getting powerful people to take the threat of climate change seriously. The most straightforward way to do that would be with bottom-up pressure: if the people who vote demand that their leaders take assertive action against climate change, then politicians will have no choice but to do so (at least if they want to get into office, or to stay there). The major challenge to this, in turn, has been the lingering influence of climate denialism: disbelief in the reality that humans are the cause of climate change, or in the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p>What can be done to combat climate denialism? Back in 2011, the researchers Jonathon P. Schuldt, Sara H. Konrath, and Norbert Schwarz published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776">an article in </a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776"><em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em></a> which suggested one possible partial remedy: framing the issue a bit differently. They found that 75.0% of Americans expressed belief in “climate change,” but only 67.7% in “global warming.” It was Republicans driving this effect: among this more politically conservative subset of Americans, the difference was 60.2% versus 44.0%.</p>
<p>Those findings suggested that environmental campaigns and policy initiatives might do better if they refer to “climate change” rather than “global warming”, write Alistair Raymond Bryce Soutter and René Mõttus in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376">new paper in the </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376"><em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em></a><em><u>.</u></em> But while some follow-up studies had been conducted on this issue, with fairly mixed results, no one had yet carried out a direct, pre-registered replication. So Soutter and Mõttus attempted to both replicate the original result and expand it to two other countries: the United Kingdom and Australia. (This gave them a total sample size of 5,717, about double that of the original study.)</p>
<p><span id="more-39542"></span>As in the first study, the researchers simply asked respondents about whether they believed in climate change in one of two conditions — one which referred to the climate “changing”, and one which referred to it “warming” (see full wording below). This time around, though, the researchers found no statistically significant difference between the two conditions (88.8% registered agreement that “climate change” was occurring, while 88.0% said “global warming” was.) That pattern repeated itself in the study’s three main subgroups: in neither the US, the UK, nor Australia did word choice matter. Interestingly, and contrary to the original experiment, word choice didn’t matter among political conservatives, either. One aspect of the 2011 finding — unfortunately — was replicated: in all countries, conservatives were less likely than liberals to believe in climate change.</p>
<p>Why the generally different results this time around? The researchers explain that there’s no way to know, but they speculate it could be some combination of causes: one is simply that the American sample was a bit different, politically, with more self-identified Democrats and Republicans and fewer Independents and Others than in the 2011 sample (though it’s hard to imagine that having much of an impact on what had been such a giant-sized effect on Republicans). Perhaps more importantly, the 2011 study drew on data collected in 2009, and “[s]ince then there have been major social, political, and indeed environmental changes.” The terms might simply mean different things to people today than they did back then.</p>
<p>There’s one arguably questionable aspect of the original study’s methodology — and, since it was a direct replication, the follow-up as well — that bears mentioning. Here’s the language presented to the two groups, with the differences bolded by me:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature <strong>may have been changing</strong> over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘climate change’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature may <strong>have been going up </strong>over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘global warming’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>It could be argued that this doesn’t capture exactly what researchers are interested in. What matters is whether and to what extent people agree that the planet is <em>warming</em>, and the first passage doesn’t mention that concept at all due to the fact that <em>two</em> word choices, not just one, are different. So a different rate of agreement with the two statements could just reflect the fact that they are saying two different things — the first is asking the respondent whether the planet’s climate is merely “changing” (up, down, up and then down over time, whatever), while the second specifically points out “warming”. A cleaner test would have mentioned the temperature going up in both conditions, only swapping out “global warming” versus “climate change.”</p>
<p>Setting that aside, this partially failed replication is compatible with belief held by many researchers: when issues become politicised, people cling more tightly to their opinions. It could be that word choice matters more for issues that don’t have much of a bearing on someone’s ideological or social allegiances. But once an idea becomes politicised, it feels threatening to have the ‘wrong’ view on it, which suggests subtle matters like word choice likely matter less. And climate change (or global warming, if you like) has certainly become more politicised since 2009, unfortunately.</p>
<p>All of which suggests that something as minor as word choice is rarely going to nudge people’s beliefs on as contentious an issue as this one.</p>

Sounds absurd, doesn't it? But not really. Not any more. Here's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trumps-first-deepfake/610750/" target="_blank">David Frum</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">April 26, 2020, was an especially manic day in the presidency of  Donald Trump.  <b>...</b>  something was gnawing at him. Perhaps his  business troubles were weighing on him.  <b>...</b>  Or perhaps Trump was still seething at the widespread  ridicule of his press conference of April 23, when he suggested using  disinfectant “<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahcpr/status/1253474772702429189" target="_blank" title="you must watch this parody by Sarah Cooper">by injection</a>.” Or perhaps something else had shifted his  mood from its usual setting of <i>seething aggrievement</i> to <i>frothing fury</i>.<br /><br />Whatever  the cause, between early afternoon and near 9 o’clock eastern time,  Trump fired off a sequence of crazy-even-for-him tweets and retweets. He  demanded that reporters be stripped of the <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>“Noble prizes”</b></span> they had  supposedly been awarded for their reporting on Trump scandals,  apparently conflating them with the Pulitzers—and then pretended that  his misspelling of <i>Nobel</i> had been intentional.  <b>...</b>  He retweeted an increasingly wild and weird range of  supporters’ Twitter accounts.</blockquote><br />Trump shows no compassion for the suffering around him, no sympathy for the families devastated by the loss of their loved ones, and only hollow praise for the health care workers, the bus drivers, the home delivery drivers, the grocery store clerks, and the sanitation workers who put their lives on the line every day.<br /><br />Eternal optimists say “we're all in this together” while sitting at home on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/" target="_blank" title="oh boo hoo, 'Zoom Fatigue'">Zoom meetings</a>, placing endless orders on Amazon, and fretting about their sourdough starter. I'm only marginally better, but I realize I'm privileged. {I've tried to help financially <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> contributing to homeless organizations, a fund for unemployed hourly workers, bookstores, museums, etc.}<br /><br />And obviously I'm way more pessimistic. <br /><br />How does this rant honor my cat??<br /><br /><br /><b>Case History </b><br /><br />Max was diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma in August 2019 at the age of 16. He also had a murky ailment that made it difficult for him to eat (“his tongue is inflamed” or later, “he has a mass at the base of his tongue”), but the true cause was never confirmed. He was prescribed oral chemotherapy pills three times a week and an <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/steroid-treatment-long-term-effects-in-cats" target="_blank">oral steroid</a> (prednisolone syrup) twice daily. I declined the chemo pills, opting for quality of life for both of us. Max's oral steroid became unworkable after four doses.<br /><br />This was not fair, especially after my wife suffered through Stage 4 cancer for a year. <br /><br />Another vet started bimonthly / monthly injections of Depo-Medrol (<a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/methyl-prednisolone" target="_blank">methyl prednisolone</a>) to reduce the inflammation in his mouth, and as a partial treatment for his lymphoma. It worked wonders (for a while). He ran up and down stairs, played with his toys, and jumped over the red chair!<br /><br />He started getting worse in January. His weight was down to 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg), a 2 lb loss in two months. He was prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine" target="_blank">buprenorphine</a> as needed for pain and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/mirataz-mirtazapine-transdermal-ointment-veterinarians" target="_blank" title="Ha! mirtazapine is an antidepressant for humans that causes -- you guessed it -- weight gain">transdermal mirtazapine</a> as an appetite stimulant. My quest for palatable foods became more and more challenging. I spent hours walking the aisles of pet superstores.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="405" data-original-width="720" height="225" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jfd4NSoAOGw/Xqd-UC6D8oI/AAAAAAAANGU/hvfPRsVtKfYTIHA-ndK_yzVdqOLASeItwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/foods%2Bfor%2BMax.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><b>ADDENDUM (April 28, 2020):</b> How could I forget his stint on an all-chicken diet (KFC </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> no skin of course </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> or grocery store roasted chicken), which he enjoyed for a few weeks until he could no longer eat chicken... </span></span><br /><br />His last regular appointment was March 9. And then the shelter-in-place orders were issued.<br /><br /><br /><b>Pet Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic</b><br /><br />Max's condition was getting worse. Depo-Medrol was less and less effective, and he needed injections every two weeks. The veterinary practice enacted stringent measures to protect its essential workers. In-person appointments were reserved for animals showing signs of extreme pain and suffering. Virtual Vet was used for consults and for recommending treatment plans. We had an appointment on March 27. Max was prescribed his usual meds. I picked them up curbside (calling upon arrival) and paid via contactless transaction. I watched a helpful <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS815US815&amp;oq=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.8839j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> and then administered his subcutaneous injection of Depo-Medrol.<br /><br />By April 16, I had grown desperate. The poor fellow was having a severe bout of diarrhea that lasted for days. I tried scheduling a Virtual Vet appointment and called for a refill of buprenorphine. Finally I got through and picked up more meds the next day. These included oral <a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/metronidazole" target="_blank" title="chicken flavor!">metronidazole</a>, a hideously bitter and distressing medication that made his mouth foam.<br /><br />He improved slightly. I was up for hours in the middle of the night, trying to coax him to eat. Some "meaty morsels" and "flaked' varieties were palatable for their gravy. I got out the food processor and whirled them into a very soft format, which he mostly rejected. “But you were just licking the gravy off these meaty morsels!” I told him. Finally I came up with a winning concoction. But this was only a palliative interlude before the inevitable.<br /><br />Then I realized I'd established a Palliative Care Unit for my cat.<br /><br />On April 23, I could no longer care for him myself. I brought him to the ER for severe dehydration. He had blood work and an "incidental" ultrasound, neither of which he'd had since his initial diagnosis. The results were devastating. Anemia due to suspected blood loss from his GI tract. Elevated white blood cell count (no surprise). Emerging diabetes mellitus (e.g., glucose in his urine), a known side-effect of steroid treatment. He weighed only 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs).<br /><br />Most concerning was “free fluid in the abdomen and what looks like masses, possibly lymph nodes and fluid distended bowel loops.”  /  “If he does not improve in the next few days to a week, humane euthanasia should be considered given what we know.”<br /><br />I picked him up and brought him home. He hated car rides much more than actual visits to the vet or treatments of any sort. Veterinary staff all loved him. The report from his ER doc even said, “Max is a very good cat.” <br /><br />He was withdrawn for several hours. Then he got over it and sat on my lap in the red chair, purring. Here he is, as beautiful as ever.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="414" data-original-width="720" height="230" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The change in Max from that day to the next was astounding. He couldn't  hold his head up any more. He tried to drink some water but couldn't manage to do it. I don't think  any additional intervention would have improved his condition. I  didn't want to wait any longer and had to act quickly.<br /><br />I was fortunate  to find a caring and compassionate vet who made house calls, and wasn't  ridiculously overboard on COVID-19 restrictions. Some said they wouldn't  enter the main living area — it had to take place outside or in the  garage or in their mobile van. But Max was in a comfortable and familiar  environment, at least. And then he didn't have to suffer any longer.<br /><br /><br />Max  was such a sweet, loving, affectionate cat. He sought me out until the  end, until his very last day when he was too weak to do so.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="212" data-original-width="432" height="157" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oLOV5eGK4v4/XqeqxIsiKhI/AAAAAAAANGs/tEasqUX33awEoXjSLpeSjRMuJ9XtpaW4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Max%2B04-23-2020_1208am_small.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />This is another story of love, and of loss.

<br /><p><a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora 32</a> was released today after a full six
months of development. There are a lot of improvements and new changes included
in this release. You can read the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-32-2/">announcement here</a> and the complete
release notes <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release is particularly exciting for the NeuroFedora team. It also marks
the first release of our first deliverable: the CompNeuro Lab ISO image! The
aim of developing such ready to install ISO images that are packed with the
necessary tools is to enable users to quickly set up their computers and get
down to work, instead of wasting precious time and effort on installing tools
individually by hand. While we hope that this will enable researchers by
providing them easy access to Free/Open Source research tools, we also hope
that the platform will serve as a teaching aid in Computational Neuroscience
courses.</p>

<p>All of these tools have been built with the current best practices in Software
Development in mind---this is mandated by the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/">Fedora community's software
packaging guidelines</a>. In addition to
modelling tools, the ISO image also includes multiple tools used in analysis of
data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the complete <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scipy.org/">Python science stack</a>: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, SymPy, and Pandas,</li>

</ul>
<p>This is not all, though! There's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/software/">even more Neuroscience software</a> that can be
installed from the repositories. Also, since this edition is derived from
Fedora, users have access to the <em>complete</em> set of packages that are included
in Fedora: all the <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/">desktop environments</a>,
productivity tools, development tools, and libraries that you can choose from.</p>
<p>The CompNeuro ISO image is based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/">Fedora Workstation</a> product that uses the modern <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME
desktop environment</a>.  It provides a clean interface
integrated with a plethora of daily use productivity and development tools:</p>

<p>Developing NeuroFedora is also a great learning experience, especially for
students. As a volunteer based community project, we learn skills and tools
together and share knowledge freely with each other. No skills or experience
are necessary to join the community. You can find what you want to do, and
gather the required knowledge as you go at your own pace. We strongly encourage
students to join the team, contribute their bit, and learn more about the tools
use in Neuroscience while they do it.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Our memories are not always reliable. But sometimes they’re rich, textured and vivid — even if they didn’t happen. Research has suggested false memories <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.993&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">often have the descriptive, multisensory elements of real memories</a>, a fact that obviously poses both interesting questions about memory itself and difficulties for those relying on eyewitness encounters for evidence.</p>
<p>But beyond the question of <em>how </em>people remember is another quandary: are we, as observers, able to tell whether someone’s memory is true or false? It’s a question tackled by UCL’s Julia Shaw <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00650/full">in a new study</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology —</em> and she finds that not only are we susceptible to having memories planted, we’re not very good at working out when someone else’s memory is false either.</p>
<p><span id="more-39534"></span>Shaw has worked on false memory and our susceptibility to it before. In 2015, she co-authored a paper that claimed to have successfully implanted false memories of having committed a crime in 70% of participants; these crimes ranged from petty theft to the much more serious assault with a weapon. Videos of these participants recalling true and false memories formed the stimuli for the new work.</p>
<p>(It’s important to note that the findings from Shaw’s 2015 study have been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/15/psychologists-clash-over-how-easy-it-is-to-implant-false-memories-of-committing-a-crime/">subject to much debate</a>, with some psychologists arguing that the coding scheme used in the study led to wildly inflated results. However, all videos of false memories included in <em>this</em> paper were also classified as false memories in a re-analysis by critics.)</p>
<p>In the first study, 124 participants saw videos of someone recalling both a real and a false memory of events that had (supposedly) happened during their adolescence. In one condition, participants saw the person recalling an emotive false memory (e.g. being attacked by an animal, being bullied or the death of a parent) while in the other condition, the false memory related to committing a crime (e.g. an assault with a weapon). Participants were told before watching the videos that “all, some, or none of the videos” involved memories of real accounts. Afterwards they were told one memory was real and one was false, and were asked to identify which was the false one.</p>
<p>In the second study, participants were shown the same videos <em>—</em> only this time, one set of participants watched the video with sound, one listened just to the audio, and a final set watched the video without audio.</p>
<p>The results suggest that participants are not better than chance at classifying false memories <em>—</em> about 57% of false memories were identified in the first study, and only 44% in the second. Numbers were similar across conditions: criminal false memories were identified 55% of the time in study one and 44% in study two. In study two, accuracy was highest when participants were given video with audio (53% accuracy) and worst with just audio (32%) .</p>
<p>Shaw argues that the study’s results demonstrate that false memories look real to an observer: even though participants knew that one memory was false and one was true, they were still unable to accurately tell the difference.</p>
<p>This could have serious implications for judges, police officers, lawyers and others involved with gathering evidence and interviewing eyewitnesses. Shaw <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/apr/false-memories-crime-appear-real-when-retold-others">points to judges in particular</a>, who should “never assume they can tell when someone has a false memory … and should consider the entire process to see if there was any risk of contamination of a defendant or witness’ memories.”</p>
<p>The results should almost be beside the point <em>—</em> judges, lawyers and police officers should <em>already</em> try to assume they can’t always tell whether someone’s memory is accurate or not. So it will be interesting to see exactly how these findings are taken by legal and law enforcement officials. Memory, for better or worse, is a key part of evidence; being cautious before we make any firm conclusions about it may be vital to ensuring that evidence is as watertight as possible.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though it may vary based on context or mood, most of us have a fairly steady belief in how intelligent we think we are. Whether that belief is in any way accurate or even helpful is a different questio<span>n</span><span> — one 2019 study found that </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/">people who were happier to admit they don’t know something actually had better general knowledge</a><span>, whilst a survey from the year before found that the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/">majority of Americans believed they were smarter than average</a><span>. We’re also susceptible to the same foibles when it comes to those close to us, tending to </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">rate our romantic partners as more intelligent than they actually are</a><span>. </span></p>
<p>But how early do our ideas about our own intelligence start, and how do they relate to other facets of our personality? In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new research published in </a><em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">Personality and Individual Differences</a>,</em> Marcin Zajenkowski looks at just that.</p>
<p><span id="more-39531"></span></p>
<p>The way we perceive our intelligence seems to have an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976">important</a><u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976"> effect on both academic achievement and how we feel about ourselves</a></u>. Though studies have largely focused on adults, Zajenkowski argues that this is also likely to be the case amongst teenagers, too, where some evidence has already suggested that self-perceived ability in Maths and English is correlated with actual achievement.</p>
<p>First, Zajenkowski asked 428 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 to rate their own intelligence compared to other people on a scale from 1 (very low) to 25 (very high). Next, they completed a test of objective intelligence which measured abstract and non-verbal reasoning.</p>
<p>Participants also completed a measure of the Big Five personality traits, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory was used to assess grandiose narcissism: participants rated themselves on 34 statements such as “I have a natural talent for influencing people” and “I will be a success”. Finally, participants rated their life satisfaction, rating how much they agreed or disagreed with sentiments including “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”.</p>
<p>Zajenkowski found that teenagers with higher levels of narcissism and those who scored higher on the “intellect” personality trait tended to make higher assessments of their own intelligence. These participants also showed greater levels of life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gender also played a part, with male students scoring significantly higher than female students on self-assessed intelligence, as well as narcissism, extraversion and life satisfaction. But, importantly, there was no gender difference in <em>objective </em>intelligence.</p>
<p>This mirrors what had already been found in adult populations (one researcher dubbed it the “male hubris, female humility” effect). It’s not clear when in development self-assessed intelligence starts to become associated with gender, though studies looking at only slightly younger children have found no gendered difference.</p>
<p>But unlike in studies on adults, there was no correlation between self-assessed intelligence and objective intelligence. Zajenkowski argues that this may be down to the way objective intelligence was measured: the test used in this study looked at abstract thinking, and  previous research has suggested that people may not see this kind of thinking as an aspect of intelligence until they’re of university age. Teenagers, therefore, may not value it or even see it as a facet of intelligence.</p>
<p>It could therefore be useful to include a wider range of IQ tests in future work. Firstly, this could provide a more comprehensive picture of intellect with which to compare self-assessed intelligence; secondly, it may be a better fit when it comes to how teenagers perceive what intelligence actually means.</p>
<p>Effort must also be made by educators and families to ensure that girls are just as confident and sure in their abilities and intelligence as boys. Not only might this increase well-being, it could disrupt negative gender stereotypes as it does so.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology/">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></h4>

<p>The scars of emotional abuse are invisible, deep, and diverse; and unfortunately, emotional abuse likely impacts more students than we think.</p><p>Emotionally abusive behavior broadly consists of criticism, degradation, rejection, or threat. Emotional abuse (also known as psychological maltreatment or verbal assault) can happen anywhere, both within and outside of families, and can refer to a single severe incident or a chronic, ongoing pattern. Educators, caregivers, coaches, school mental health professionals, administrators, and peers are all capable of acting emotionally abusive toward school-age youth. That is part of its insidious invisibility; despite emotional abuse being highly involved in childhood abuse cases, it is often forgotten and overlooked. This type of interpersonal trauma is typically chronic and cuts deeply, as it is associated with mental and physical health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, self-harm) during the school years and beyond.</p><p>Even with this existing knowledge, emotional abuse remains misunderstood, minimized, unseen, and unreported by many, including school professionals. We outline three things teachers need to know about emotional abuse and three things they can do to meet the needs of students experiencing emotional abuse.</p><p><em><strong>What to know</strong></em></p><p><strong>The impact on the student determines the occurrence of emotional abuse more than the behavior that caused it. </strong></p><p>There is no legal or clinical universal definition of emotional abuse. For example, two students with a parent teasing them about their appearances may react differently, in part based on context and relationship with the parent. Emotional abuse would be determined by the impact on the student, rather than the teasing alone.</p><p><strong>Emotional abuse is detrimental to both a student’s way of thinking and feeling. </strong></p><p>Children create their sense of self from stories that others construct about them. Students may believe the destructive narratives that are told to them. That is, these harmful words may impact students at their core—shifting how they think about themselves and the world, and how they feel about themselves and others.</p><p><strong>There are numerous ways that emotional abuse may manifest. </strong></p><p>Emotional abuse is not simply hearing harmful words. The context around the experience of emotional abuse are varied and diverse. A student may internalize or externalize their behaviors, or something in between. If a school-aged youth is repeatedly told that she is worthless, then the student may be meek in class. If a student is threatened repeatedly, then she may act aggressively toward others.</p><p><em><strong>What to do</strong></em></p><p><strong>Take care of your emotional needs and your emotional health.</strong></p><p>Educators cannot support students if they cannot support themselves. As some students may constantly hear emotionally destructive words in their home environments, teachers certainly do not want to bring any semblance of that into their schools. Nevertheless, working with students can be tiring and frustrating. If their emotional energy is low, teachers may react rather than respond to difficult situations that unexpectedly arise. Rather than taking a breath, teachers might begin to punitively scold or admonish a student. Teachers need to take care of their emotional needs so that they do not parallel any unhealthy at-home behaviors in the classroom.</p><p><strong>Foster sharing through strong relationships. </strong></p><p>Try to examine the life contexts behind a student’s behaviors. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with students, be curious about the circumstances in students’ lives that may influence how they act in school. To have a firmer understanding, teachers need to create brave spaces in our schools and classrooms so that students may feel comfortable sharing with adults. Students often regard educators as more effective guardians in violence protection than police or security, which speaks to the importance of continuing to cultivate this trust. When students share feelings, provide positive reinforcement by expressing your gratitude or by giving a thoughtful, affirming response.</p><p><strong>Know the laws around mandated reporting, and communicate with transparency.</strong></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/manda/">Check state regulations</a> and learn to whom to report and how to report within your district or county. If and when suspicion or reports of abuse arise, reach out to your school mental health professionals. Encourage your administrators to grow emotional abuse awareness, prevention, and intervention initiatives so that others feel willing to report even in instances of suspected abuse.

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory
representations.</p>

<p>This episode of <em>Brain Science</em> is an interview with neuroscientist Matthew Cobb author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3avdYDa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience."</a></p> <p>Cobb approaches the history of neuroscience from a different perspective than previous writers. He writes from the perspective of a working scientist with a deep interest in the history of ideas and the interaction between science and culture. This approach makes for a fascinating discussion.</p> <p>Through out history assumptions about the brain have been influenced by both culture and contemporary science. For example, before the discovery of electricity it was impossible to image that the brain uses both chemical and electrical signals to communicate. Similarly, our current understanding is heavily influenced by the computer metaphor, which actually misses much about how real brains function.</p> <p>Another aspect of our discussion involves several ongoing debates with neuroscience such as the importance of localization versus network properties. We also touch on the tendency toward neuromythology, which is the tendency to think that understanding the brain is the only tool for understanding what it means to be human. Dr. Cobb reminds of the importance of being aware of the work in a wide varieties of fields include science and the humanities.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3avdYDa" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Amazon link"><em>The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience</em></a> by Matthew Cobb <ul> <li>Complete Bibliography at <a href="https://theideaofthebrain.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bibliography.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">theideaofthebrain.com</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Please visit <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additional references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> <p>Please Visit Our Sponsors:</p> <ul> <li>The Great Courses Plus at <a href="http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER">thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER</a></li> <li>TextExpander at <a href="https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=textexpander-Apr-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Textexpander link">textexpander.com/podcast</a> </li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>The new expanded edition of <em>Are You Sure?

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Consumer-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have received a lot of hype in recent years — but many scientists are worried that the claims about what these devices can achieve don’t match the reality</strong>, <a href="https://undark.org/2020/04/22/brain-technology-interface/">reports Benjamin Powers</a> at <em>Undark</em>. Often these devices also fall into a regulatory grey area, potentially leaving consumers, or their data, at risk.<span id="more-39523"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>On the medical side, however, BCIs are showing promise in helping paralysed people to move again. </strong>This week researchers report giving a patient an implant that not only restored movement to his hand, but also allowed him to detect objects by touch. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2241576-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-move-and-feel-with-his-hand/">Donna Lu has the story</a> at <em>New Scientist. </em></p>

<p><strong>We’ve probably all had the experience in recent weeks of cringing when a character on TV shakes hands with someone or touches their face. </strong>Thanks to the pandemic, we have a conditioned aversion to these kinds of behaviours, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-cringe/610180/">writes Marina Koren</a> at <em>The Atlantic</em> — but once this is all over, how long will it take for us to “unlearn” these associations?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>March saw a huge number of people watching and reading news, particularly news about coronavirus — but now those figures are dropping back down. </strong>Although research is still ongoing,<strong> t</strong>here could be psychological reasons for this drop, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-news-fatigue">writes Will Bedingfield</a> at <em>Wired</em>: it could reflect reduced anxiety in the general population, or, more worryingly, a kind of “desensitisation” to coronavirus-related news.</p>

Sometimes scientific findings can be too hot to handle. Literally.  A team of researchers in India and Japan who reported breakthrough results in two papers about electromagnetics, including an article in Science, are retracting the articles because the exciting data resulted from experimental error. To be precise: unbeknownst to them, inadvertent heating of their samples … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/23/too-hot-to-handle-authors-retract-science-paper-on-electromagnetics/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Too hot to handle: Authors retract Science paper on electromagnetics</span></a>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>While waiting for the philharmonic orchestra to begin in the concert hall, you observe the people around you and wonder, “What made them come to this place?” The love of music? Snobbery? Conformism — because other friends do this? Or, maybe there are other, deeper motives? Similar questions arise when we think about what drives people to participate in pop culture and consume its products. Do they simply enjoy it? Scientists’ answers to this question can be surprising. For example, one study suggests that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/01/even-those-participants-who-claimed-pop-culture-is-unimportant-suffered-psychological-ill-effects-from-feeling-out-of-the-loop/">we consume pop culture because we suffer psychological ill effects from feeling out of the loop</a>.</p>
<p>But what drives people to become cultural omnivores, those who consume both “highbrow” <em>and</em> “lowbrow” culture? Hanna Shin and Nara Youn from Hongik University in Seoul recently <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000303">investigated</a> this question in a paper in <em>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39517"></span></p>
<p>Cultural omnivorousness is a relatively new phenomenon. Until the first half of the 20th century, participation in highbrow or lowbrow culture was clearly associated with social and economic status. Opera, symphony orchestra, and painting exhibitions are places traditionally included in highbrow culture. Street performances and graffiti are considered to be products of lowbrow culture. The former are usually credited with greater intellectual sophistication and artistic values, while the latter are often considered to be more authentic and of higher intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Shin and Youn wondered whether personality factors such as narcissism, self-esteem, and feelings of authenticity could explain how likely someone is to be a cultural omnivore. To find out, they conducted two studies. In the first, they tested 178 undergraduate students, asking them to complete the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and a measure of self-esteem, as well as a scale that measured their distinction-seeking drive: that is, the desire to stand out. Participants were also asked to indicate their intentions to participate in highbrow and lowbrow cultural activities (e.g. “visiting art galleries” and “going to pop concerts”, respectively).</p>
<p>The results showed that participants who scored high in narcissism and <em>also</em> had low self-esteem tended to be cultural omnivores. These “insecure narcissists” seemed to be driven to consume both high- and lowbrow culture because of their desire to distinguish themselves from others.</p>
<p>In the second study, Shin and Youn explored more specific motivations for insecure narcissists’ cultural omnivorousness. The researchers created two biographies of a fictional artist: in the highbrow condition, the biography stated that the artist’s paintings had been displayed in major museums around the world, while in the lowbrow condition it stated the paintings were kept by family and later discovered by a collector. One hundred and forty-four undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions and completed scales of personality. After they had reviewed the applicable biography and viewed two examples of the artist’s paintings, they rated the paintings as highbrow or lowbrow, and indicated how likely they would be to visit or recommend an exhibition of the artist’s work. Finally, they completed scales of status-seeking motivations.</p>
<p>The results suggested that insecure narcissists had different reasons for consuming highbrow and lowbrow art. When they believed the paintings were highbrow, their intention to visit or recommend the exhibition seemed to be driven by a desire to consume status-seeking products . But when they believed the paintings were lowbrow, their intention to consume the art was fuelled instead by a desire to signal self-integrity.</p>
<p>The research adds much to the understanding of the motives for one’s participation in culture, going beyond the narrow focus on economic status. The results suggest at least one psychological mechanism underlying cultural omnivorousness: a combination of narcissism and psychological insecurity, which is related to a drive to signal both status and self-integrity.</p>
<p>But it also leaves many questions to be answered. How valid is the division between highbrow and lowbrow contemporary culture: is the appearance of cultural omnivores not the result of blurring the boundaries between these two types of cultures? Does a laboratory experiment reflect the complexity of motives that push us to participate in culture? Finally, are the examined motives and personality traits the most important? There is certainly still much to be done in this research area, and studies that include more psychological variables and factors could definitely enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Syrian-Doctor-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece or interned in deplorable and dramatic conditions on Greek islands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html">[1]</a>. This drama painfully reminds us that the conflict in Syria continues to be the biggest driver of migration. Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian migrants have crossed into Europe. Syrians are now the third-largest group of people with a foreign nationality in Germany, and among Syrian immigrants, there are comparatively many well-educated and trained health care professionals, e.g. some 3,000-4,000 medical doctors <a href="https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/ueber-uns/aerztestatistik/aerztestatistik-2018">[2]</a>. Not all of them have fled their country as refugees; many have been granted visas, as Germany is principally welcoming Syrian doctors.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Germany needs Syrian doctors</strong></h3>
<p>The reason is simple: In Germany, a relative shortage of physicians has developed over the recent years. A change in working time regulations and a growing demand for part-time jobs, has increased the need for additional doctors. Like many other developed countries, Germany relies on international medical graduates or doctors to supplement its locally trained staff so as to maintain their health care system. Further, as the number of Syrian migrants increases, so does the number of Syrian patients being treated in hospitals and doctors’ offices, resulting in a novel need for Arabic-speaking medical staff. Therefore, Syrian doctors are able to fulfill a double function.</p>
<p>Given this background, it may seem paramount to make the licensure process for Syrian immigrant doctors as straightforward and as swift as possible, actively supporting and advising applicants through the relevant processes. But in fact, the act of obtaining a permanent license to be allowed to practice medicine in Germany is onerous, lengthy, and can bring about many negative experiences. These can include feelings of humiliation, lack of transparency, arbitrariness, and helplessness. This is what many of the 20 Syrian doctors told us in an interview study we performed from 2016-2017.</p>
<h3><strong>Syrian doctors in Germany and their stories: the basis of our study</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05209-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">this study</a> arose when a recently immigrated Syrian dentist, began working with us while waiting for his German dental license to be approved.</p>
<p>He told our team about his experiences with a “bureaucratic”, slow and confusing application procedure to secure his license. We were intrigued by his experiences and wanted to seek out other Syrian health care professionals’ experiences of the system. A qualitative study was designed and we received an overwhelming response to our call for interviewees on a Facebook page for Syrian Doctors in Germany. Within a few days, twenty Syrian health professionals were prepared to share their stories through face-to-face interviews.</p>
<h3><strong>Being lost in an opaque and arbitrary bureaucratic process: that’s what it feels like being a Syrian doctor applying for a medical license in Germany</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that upon arrival in Germany, Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p>
<p>One physician explained: “<em>When I started applying for the temporary license … some rules changed and the authorities were now requiring a C1 course in medical German to obtain the temporary license! After I started the C1 language course, they required the exam for medical terms. When we completed one step, they asked for another step…nothing is stable here.</em>”</p>
<p>Interviewees describe a Kafkaesque system where they feel at the mercy of Government employees and reviewers who ask for absurd and impossible accomplishments, refuse to give information and act at random. This is shown in the quote of another interview partner: “<em>There are no clear steps. You can have two [Syrian] doctors who studied at the same university, finished their studies in the same year, – and then one of them can obtain the approbation without any exam, and the other one will need to take another exam. At the end of the day, only one person makes the decision about you. …And of course, we cannot meet this person or talk with them. We don’t even know their name.”</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11846" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Admin work" class="size-medium wp-image-11846" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/pexels-photo-52608-300x201.jpeg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair with the medical license application process.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Consequently, the interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair. As informational and practical support from official institutions was scarce, the Syrian doctors relied on personal networks and peers to understand the requirements and find a job.</p>
<h3><strong>Where next?</strong></h3>
<p>To obtain a balanced view of the licensure process and the interactions involved, future research should explore the perspective of the administrative staff in the German Chamber of Physicians or job centers as well. Naturally, these regulative bodies were not prepared for the large number of migrant doctors applying for a license and were surprised by the abrupt rise in the number of licensure procedures. Journalists have reported that ratifying Syrian diplomas may be difficult because in some cases, fraudulent documents have been provided <a href="https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/innenministerium-warnt-falsche-zeugnisse-und-diplome-fluechtlinge-koennen-im-libanon-antragspakete-kaufen_id_5066196.html">[3</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/europe/germany-refugees-doctors.html">4]</a>. For the medical profession, in particular, credentials and certificates should be checked thoroughly and carefully. Nevertheless, Germany may learn from other countries such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, which have harmonized and simplified assessment procedures for overseas-trained doctors, and implemented specific resources guiding and supporting foreign health professionals in different stages of their application process <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/8/nationally-consistent-assessment-international-medical-graduates">[5</a>,<a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-016-0135-6">6]</a>.</p>
<p>Welcoming Syrian doctors in Germany is more important than ever – especially as the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for skilled medical staff in hospitals. While German authorities claim to be making an effort to find as many helping hands as possible to cope with the impending shortage of health care professionals, there are no signs that the accreditation process of foreign doctors – Syrian doctors among them – may be accelerated, or handled in a more pragmatic way <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/despite-coronavirus-foreign-doctors-struggle-to-get-degrees-recognized-in-germany/a-52966674">[7]</a>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>For many, running a marathon is seen as the ultimate amateur athletic achievement; for others, it’s just the start. Ultramarathon runners often take on courses of incredibly impressive length, running 50 or 100 kilometres at one time or over several days.</p>
<p>Clearly this is physically demanding, and only those in seriously good shape will be able to take on such challenges — ultramarathon running involves stress on muscles and bones, blisters, dehydration, sleep deprivation and mental and physical fatigue, so it’s really not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>But what about the psychological traits that make someone suitable for long-distance running? What kind of person can withstand this kind of physical stress, and how? A <a href="https://aps.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajpy.12287?af=R">new study</a> in the <em>Australian Journal of Psychology</em> takes a look.<span id="more-39510"></span></p>
<p>Gregory Roebuck from Monash University and colleagues recruited 20 ultrarunners and 20 control participants aged between 18 and 70; runners were matched with non-runners by gender and age. Participants were asked about their exercise behaviours and running experiences before completing a number of questionnaires. These included a 25-item scale designed to measure resilience (with participants rating how much they agreed with statements such as “I am able to adapt when changes occur”), and two questionnaires that looked at emotion regulation — the ways a person moderates or expresses their emotion. Finally, a 155-item questionnaire looked at a range of personality traits across domains like well-being, achievement, stress reaction, and, aggression.</p>
<p>Next, participants took part in an emotion regulation task, viewing 36 neutral images (e.g. a sofa or chair) and 36 negative images (e.g. a bloody medical scene). Before viewing each image, participants were asked to either respond naturally to it (a “look” trial) or attempt to not have a negative reaction to it (a “decrease” trial), before rating the strength of their emotional response. Heart rate and skin conductance were measured during this section of the experiment.</p>
<p>Ultrarunners scored significantly higher on the resilience questionnaire than non-runners, and were more likely to indicate they used positive reappraisal when regulating their emotions — in other words, they were better able to reframe a situation with a positive angle. This may be down to the need to maintain high levels of motivation during races, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/29/a-mental-technique-calledcognitive-reappraisal-makes-long-distance-running-feel-easier">attaching positive meaning to negative events in order to keep running</a>.</p>
<p>There was also a physiological difference between ultrarunners and non-runners in the emotion regulation task, with ultrarunners showing reduced skin conductance and heart rate even when viewing unpleasant images. However, they didn’t show any differences in their ability to decrease their response to negative images.</p>
<p>There was one measure on which ultrarunners scored lower, however — affiliative extraversion, which measures how socially warm people are, which the team puts down to the high levels of solitude involved in long-distance running.  There was no significant difference in any of the other measures.</p>
<p><span>The results suggest that ultrarunners are pretty similar to the rest of us — with some important differences. While it’s clear that ultrarunners are indeed more resilient than non-runners, and use different emotion regulation strategies, the direction of those relationships is not yet clear. It could be that training for ultramarathons makes people more resilient, or, on the other hand, it could be that people with higher levels of resilience are more likely to be attracted to the pastime.</span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to further explore how ultrarunners motivate themselves through many hours of pain and effort. Because even though most of us will never run 100 kilometres in one go (and may have no desire to, either), understanding how to tolerate pain, and cope with physical and mental fatigue, is a lesson we all could benefit from.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/chaos-485491_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Since the early 2000’s there has been growing interest in the phenomenon of household chaos and how it impacts on the well-being and development of children. Yet despite this interest, no review has been conducted that comprehensively brings the existing literature together. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08587-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">systematic scoping review</a> we have published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> aims to address this gap.</p>
<h4>What we found</h4>
<p>With remarkable consistency, increased chaos in a child’s home, defined as high levels of background noise (e.g. from TV), constant rushing, and environmental commotion and confusion, negatively impacted on almost every child outcome investigated, from cognitive and academic performance, to stress physiology, and socio-emotional well-being.</p>
<h4>Chaos and parenting</h4>
<p>So how could household chaos have such far-ranging implications for the well-being of children? An important clue lies in the relationship between chaos and parenting behaviors. We found that, yet again with remarkable consistency, greater chaos was associated with increased parent-child conflict, reduced closeness in the parent-child relationship, less supportive parenting practices, and less responsive parenting. And as research has confirmed, the quality of the parent-child relationship is intricately linked to the well-being of the child.</p>
<h4>Slowing down childhood</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11837 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/children-403583_640-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Improving child well-being by slowing down the lives of children is not a new concept. Outside academia a number of groups and social movements advocate for the realignment of family time with the ‘pace of childhood’ – a pace that is much slower than the pace of the hurried, modern world children find themselves in. These approaches encourage simplification of a child’s life, through the paring back of unnecessary activities, toys, and digital media, in addition to the promotion of daily rhythms and routines known to support well-being. In short, the focus shifts away from activities that disrupt the flow of family life, and instead focuses on activities that promote parent-child communication and free play (but not computer games!), and support development of warm relationships.</p>
<h4>Research gaps</h4>
<p>Yet despite a push from outside academia to simplify the lives of children, and evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies linking chaos with poor child outcomes, we still don’t know whether reducing household chaos will have a positive impact. We also don’t know how to reduce chaos, as no studies have attempted to do this. And importantly, it still remains to be seen whether we can go too far in the other direction, resulting in a home environment that is overly structured and controlled, to the point that it lacks warmth and the opportunity for supportive and caring parent-child relationships to develop.</p>
<h4>Household chaos in the time of COVID-19</h4>
<p>At the time of undertaking the review, we could not have predicted the situation we currently find <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11838" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/table-3281047_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />ourselves in. Children around the world are spending an unprecedented amount of time at home. While we don’t know whether children living in low-chaos households will fare better, intuitively, we might expect they will. These children will likely have greater opportunities to complete their home-schooling tasks in a less distracting environment. They will also likely have more time dedicated to free, non-screen based play – the kind of play that supports their emotional well-being and development. And perhaps most importantly, there is the chance that they will have greater exposure to supportive and positive parenting practices. As such, lower household chaos in the time of COVID-19 may provide an environment more conducive to the promotion of resilience and child well-being. A unique opportunity has thus presented itself to investigate not only how low levels of chaos protect children from exposure to adversity, but also whether we can effectively reduce household chaos levels to promote better outcomes across the board for our children.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/21/an-online-summer-school-for-computational-neuroscience/">An online summer school for computational neuroscience</a></h4>

<p>Megan Peters, Konrad Kording and the people behind <a href="https://neuromatch.io/">neuromatch</a> are building an online summer school for computational neuroscience (July 13 – 31st). If you’re reading this blog – chances are you should be a student in this class or a TA. It’s going to be awesome! 3 straight weeks of computational neuro education. Designed for PhD student or postdoc experimentalists in mind, what sets it apart is matching, the same technology behind neuromatch. Become part of small tight-knit group of trainees with similar interests – bond, share, learn. But wait, there’s more:</p>



<ul><li>Low TA to student ratio (6-10)</li><li>Lectures with world-class computational neuroscientists</li><li>Tutorials in Python, cloud-based in Google Colab: take your theoretical knowledge and apply to your own data</li><li>Inclusive: 100$ tuition (waivable)</li></ul>



<p>I loved summer school (CSHL computational neuroscience: vision). I made some life-long friends and have memories to last a lifetime. We want it to be better than a real-life summer school. Better by being more inclusive, matching you with more diverse people, offering multiple levels of support, and being accessible to people at different stages in their career.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HQC_UMT8BZBpPwbkID5l8pNOVKaSMzzz0xP2_xd0No/">Syllabus is here</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen1oyFWIQ38vlBSxUdlWU4AwQ_UYGqQZcGAS_cEmMdN6cdNw/viewform">Student form is here</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4aL49WV_dnt7WlXjEwsY8Mb30I2E0VHa8LROYPcmmwkzLdw/viewform">TA form is here</a>. YOU HAVE UNTIL APRIL 27 TO SIGN UP, DO IT NOW.</p>



<h2>Teaching at scale</h2>



<p>Most real-life elite education is expensive and exclusive. In online education, it’s possible to scale to huge audiences for a fraction of the cost, and let everybody in – including people of disadvantaged backgrounds. MOOCs can have excellent learning materials – better production values, materials that resist the test of time, scannable lectures. Training educators in the latest methods can be done at scale.</p>



<p>The biggest disadvantage of MOOCs is high attrition – up to 95% of people that sign up for MOOCs drop out. New models are appearing that have the accessibility of online learning and the critical social component of real-life learning. At Stanford, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami started Code in Place, an effort to bring CS education to people at home during covid19 times. It’s a massive effort – 8,000 students from all over the world accompanied by 800 section leaders (including me!). Several factors have kept dropout to a minimum (&lt; 20% after 2 weeks):</p>



<ul><li>A low TA-to-student ratio</li><li>matching TAs to students based on learner characteristic (age, location)</li><li>engaging materials</li><li>a very high standard for TAs (Top affiliations are Stanford, Google and MIT)</li><li>a tough preparatory assignment to make sure the students entering class were motivated</li></ul>



<p>I was very excited when Konrad announced that they were working on a summer school, fresh off my Code in Place experience, so I contacted him and have joined the team to help (in a small way) organize this thing. There are a handful of experiments in teaching computational neuroscience at scale, the most successful in my opinion being the <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal Dynamics online book, tutorials, and lectures</a>. Imagine that, plus TAs, your own wolf pack, live Q&amp;A – community. That’s what we’re aiming for.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Picture the scene: you’re attending a regular medical checkup, fielding questions about your health and lifestyle, when your doctor tells you they can accurately estimate your life expectancy from your answers. Would you want to hear the truth, no matter how brutal it might be? Or would you prefer to live in ignorance?</p>
<p>If you belong to the latter category, you’re not alone. A <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3543">new study</a> in <em>Management Science </em>has found that many of us would rather avoid stressful or uncomfortable truths — even if they might benefit us.</p>
<p><span id="more-39504"></span>To find out who is most likely to avoid information and why, Emily Ho from Fordham University and colleagues first presented 380 participants with a series of scenarios designed to test their desire for knowledge about a situation that could have a favourable or unfavourable outcome for them. The scenarios replicated situations that participants were likely to have encountered in the past and fell into three broad categories: personal health, finances, and other people’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Participants were asked whether they would want to look at how well a missed investment opportunity was performing, for example, whether or not they’d want to know their risk for a particular medical condition, or if they’d want to know the truth about how well a speech had gone. (If you’re interested in finding out your own tendency to avoid information, you can see all the scenarios and take the test <a href="https://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oYP0OROwDv1f2l">here</a>). Participants’ personality traits were also measured.</p>
<p>Information avoidance was incredibly common: on average, participants indicated that they would definitely or probably not want to receive information 32% of the time. Overall, these figures were fairly stable across domains: an average of 24% would prefer not to know if a friend hated a book given as a gift, for instance, whilst 29% would avoid finding out the impact stress had had on their long-term health. Even among those who were more likely to want to hear potentially troubling information, there was often at least one domain in which they opted to remain uninformed.</p>
<p>Participants’ likelihood of avoiding information wasn’t associated with their gender, income, age or education. However, it was related to particular personality traits: those higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to new experiences tended to seek information more, while those with high neuroticism scores showed a higher likelihood of wanting to stay in the dark.</p>
<p>A second study, which saw participants rate the scenarios again, four weeks apart, suggested their responses remain stable over time.</p>
<p>A final study looked at participants’ real-world behaviour. In this case, two weeks after completing the initial survey on information avoidance, participants were given the option to be sent to a website containing potentially valuable information that they might be motivated to avoid: for instance, an occupational website that compared average salaries between men and women, or a health site informing people about their individual risk of burnout.</p>
<p>Results suggested that participants’ tendency to avoid information as measured by the survey did have an impact on real-world decisions: avoidant and seeking scores correlated with the decision to avoid or read information respectively.</p>
<p>The findings may have important uses: understanding in which situations people tend to ignore or avoid information could be vital for organisations or governments sending out public service information, for example.</p>
<p>We already knew, to some extent, that there are cases where people avoid information — interventions that seek to improve financial literacy tend to have smaller impacts than hoped, for example, partly because some people feel so anxious about money they’ll go out of their way to avoid thinking about it. Building this knowledge into the design of social interventions may be a useful way to approach such individual differences in information seeking.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Exactly how the media discusses suicide is a topic of frequent debate. <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/4/238">Plenty</a> of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lpcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=.+Media+and+suicide:+international+perspectives+on+research,+theory,+and+policy.Routledge,+2017.&amp;ots=aEVG_TEtWR&amp;sig=d6qWpbd6szrd2vPxJ14J-QU7U4Y&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=.%20Media%20and%20suicide%3A%20international%20perspectives%20on%20research%2C%20theory%2C%20and%20policy.Routledge%2C%202017.&amp;f=false">research</a> has linked media reporting  of suicide with an increase in suicidal behaviour, and both the <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">Samaritans</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/resource_booklet_2017/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), amongst others, have clear (and frequently promoted) guides for journalists on how to report suicide.</p>
<p>But such guidelines are often ignored in favour of insensitivity or sensationalism — especially when the person at hand is a celebrity. Take the recent coverage of the death of Caroline Flack: explicit, deeply intimate details were plastered across tabloids for weeks, with seemingly no thought for how those details would impact readers.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m575">new review</a>, published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, has taken a closer look at just how serious the problem is.</p>
<p><span id="more-39492"></span></p>
<p>The analysis included 20 studies which looked at the rate of suicides amongst the general population before and after the media had reported on suicide in print, online, or on TV. Of these, 14 studies looked at reports specifically on the death of a celebrity by suicide.</p>
<p>As expected, the studies found an increase in suicides during the period after the reporting of a death of a celebrity; in cases where the method was detailed, there was also an increase in the number of suicides by that same method. On average, reports of celebrity deaths by suicide were associated with an 8 to 18% increase in suicide rates in the general population, with estimates on the higher end of the scale when the celebrity in question was famous worldwide.</p>
<p>This pattern of results is also consistent with previous research which has found that media coverage of suicide can profoundly affect people’s mental health, the authors write. Suicidal thoughts often increase, as do feelings of low mood and low self-esteem.</p>
<p>As for why reports about famous people have such a large impact, one factor may be the high level of identification the general public has with celebrities. Reports may also establish suicide as a way to cope with problems, the team says.</p>
<p>Not all media coverage is associated with an increase in suicides, however: overall, reporting on suicide generally, rather than on a specific celebrity’s death, was not linked to an increase in deaths. However, past work has suggested that particular ways of reporting could increase risk: when suicide is depicted as “inevitable”, for instance, or when media outlets reinforced damaging myths.</p>
<p>Other media may also <em>help</em> those feeling suicidal, rather than impacting their mental health further. Some coverage features stories of healing or recovery, some offers support or advice, and some simply follow guidelines set by the Samaritans or WHO.</p>
<p>However, while the results do show that media reports can increase the risk of suicide among the general population, it’s also important not to draw too direct a conclusion from the findings. Suicide is a complex, nuanced thing: not only would it be irresponsible to place the blame at the door of one institution, media outlet or other specific cause, it would also be counter to the very guidelines in place to protect people. The Samaritans guidelines, for example, warn against “over-simplification of the causes or perceived triggers for a suicide”, which are “unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide”. Drawing a direct and simple line between media coverage and suicide does not adhere to that suggestion itself.</p>
<p>But, limitations aside, the analysis does have important ramifications. Guidelines do already exist, and exist for a reason: following them is hugely important when it comes to protecting mental health. Journalists may already be aware of such guidelines — but making sure they apply them to their own work is key.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.</p>
<p>While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists">SciLine</a>, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>BEFORE</em> AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject <em>evidence</em> into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and <em>then</em> get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not rude to say to a journalist, <em>“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” </em>or <em>“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” </em>or <em>“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”</em>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: <em>“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” </em>or <em>“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” </em>or <em>“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” </em></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, <em>“No comment,” </em>which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, <em>“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.</em></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.</p>
<p>It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Bats are apparently able to imitate specific sounds, an ability shown by just a few other mammals and some birds</strong>. The bats’ calls were recorded, and the sound manipulated before being played back to them. Within a month, the bats had learned to copy the sounds in exchange for a food reward, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2240435-bats-can-learn-to-copy-sounds-and-it-may-teach-us-about-human-speech/">reports Layal Liverpool</a> at <em>New Scientist</em>.

<p><strong>A new drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia has shown promising results in a clinical trial. </strong>The compound SEP-363856, developed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, reduced symptoms in patients who were early in the course of schizophrenia, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/experimental-schizophrenia-drug-could-reduce-long-neglected-symptoms?rss=1">repots Kelly Servick</a> at <em>Science</em>. This appeared to include a decrease in negative symptoms like blunted emotion, which are notoriously difficult to treat, although further research is needed to confirm these findings.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>We know that our mental health is influenced by our interactions with family members — so a new programme seeks to treat childhood anxiety indirectly, by providing sessions for parents instead of children themselves</strong>. Recent trials suggest that Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions may be as effective as CBT at treating children’s anxiety, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agzvm/giving-parents-therapy-can-help-their-anxious-children?utm_source=reddit.com">reports Shayla Love</a> at <em>Vice</em>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/04/us-funding-for-world-health-organization-should-not-be-interrupted-during-covid-19-pandemic-say-presidents-of-the-nas-nae-and-nam"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">statement</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> warning that interrupting funding for World Health Organization (WHO) would be a critical failure for our global health security. PLOS stands with the assessment of our nation’s top scientists: this is not a time to turn inward, but to collaborate for immediate, robust and concentrated international action. </span></p>
<p>As the <i>PLOS Medicine</i> editors indicate in a <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2020/04/16/we-need-to-support-the-who-not-stop-its-funding-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">perspective</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, the WHO is the only global health organization that has the tools to combat a pandemic of truly global consequences.</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">To halt funding now would risk the lives of many who rely on the WHO’s essential services and debilitate our collective progress towards understanding the virus and curbing the impact of the pandemic.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  </span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t have to be like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pioneered an expanded </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘complementary research’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eloquently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see for example PLOS Genetics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.</span></p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Are you an evening person — an owl? Or a morning person — a lark? No end of studies have reported variations in the functioning of people who like to wake and go to bed late, versus those who are early to bed and early to rise. And now a new study, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169">published in <em>PLoS One</em></a>, has found links between our “chronotype” and the way we handle emotions, reflect on our thoughts and feelings, and assert ourselves. Overall, owls do worse. And this, argues Juan Manuel Antúnez at the University of Malaga, Spain, could help to explain links between being an owl and poorer psychological well-being.</p>
<p><span id="more-39466"></span>Antúnez recruited 2,283 healthy Spanish men and women, aged 18-60 years, to complete a series of online questionnaires. First, their chronotype was assessed. This revealed that about 28% were owls, about 23% were larks, and the rest were neither. (This is similar to the estimated spread in the general population, with about 20% of us falling into each of the extreme groups and the remaining 60% in the middle.)</p>
<p>The participants also completed a questionnaire that explored their use of two different strategies for emotional regulation: “cognitive reappraisal”, which involves reframing a stressful situation to lessen its emotional impact and is related to greater well-being; and emotion suppression, which is maladaptive and is related to psychological problems like depression.</p>
<p>Another scale assessed participants’ meta-cognitions — the way they think about their thoughts and feelings. This scale included measures of maladaptive thought processes about feelings (for example, thinking that worry is useful for avoiding future problems) and thoughts (such as: “I should be controlling my thoughts all of the time” and “I am constantly aware of my thinking”).</p>
<p>The final measure asked the participants to report their own level of assertiveness — their tendency to (non-aggressively) affirm a right or a point of view.</p>
<p>The responses showed that chronotype was indeed related to these measures. The closer a participant was to the lark extreme, the more likely they were to use (beneficial) cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions. Those who were closer to the owl extreme were more likely to use suppression, however. This strategy has been related to all kinds of problems, including depression and decreased well-being, self-esteem, and social functioning.</p>
<p>Owls also scored highest for maladaptive ways of thinking about their thoughts and feelings. And they reported the lowest levels of assertiveness, while larks reported the highest. Assertiveness is a core skill for well-being, Antúnez notes, so could protect against psychological problems.</p>
<p>These results held even after controlling for gender and age-related differences. And for all the measures, those with an intermediate chronotype — who were neither owl nor lark — scored in the middle zone.</p>
<p>Because, biologically-speaking, owls only “wake up” later in the day, after normal school and work start times, they are out of sync with most countries’ daily routines. This “social jetlag” has been linked to greater fatigue. Perhaps that fatigue drives the poorer owl results on the measures in his study, Antúnez suggests. But, as he says, studies that follow people over time will be required to explore this.</p>
<p>Still, “although future longitudinal studies are needed,” he writes, “[the] results emphasize evening-type as a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances and morning-type as a protective factor against those.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Do you often spend time with your friends in order to forget about personal problems? Do you think about your friends even when you’re not with them? Have you even gone as far as ignoring your family to spend time with your friends?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to these questions, you might fit the criteria for “offline friend addiction”, according to a new scale <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/7x85m/">described in a preprint</a> on <em>PsyArxiv. </em>Except, of course, that this notion is ridiculous. How can we be addicted to socialising, the fulfilment of one of our basic human needs?</p>
<p>Well, that’s pretty much the point of the new paper, written with tongue firmly in cheek. But behind it is a serious argument: although a scale for offline friend addiction is clearly absurd, there’s another, similar concept for which such scales have already been developed — social media addiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-39471"></span>Some psychologists have expressed concern that social media is damaging our mental health or that we’ve become dependent on it, and as much as a third of the population can be classified as “addicted” using measures of social media addiction. But many aspects of social media fulfil our need to connect with others. So could people actually be addicted to socialising more generally, even when that occurs offline?</p>
<p>To investigate this not-entirely-serious question, Liam Satchell from the University of Winchester and colleagues developed the Offline-Friend Addiction Questionnaire, or O-FAQ.</p>
<p>The team created the scale by mimicking the process used to develop measures of social media addiction. Many of these were adapted from scales for other problems such as alcohol craving, replacing references to alcohol with references to social media. So the team decided to adapt these social media addiction scales in the same way: for instance, instead of respondents indicating if they “spent more time on Facebook than initially intended”, they were asked if they had “spent more time with friends than I initially intended”. The team ended up with a 37-item questionnaire, which 807 participants completed.</p>
<p>In the past, researchers have attempted to prove that social media addiction scales are valid by showing that they are associated with related measures, such as scales of problematic behaviour. So again, the authors did the same thing, “validating” the O-FAQ by demonstrating that participants’ scores were associated with risk-taking behaviour and certain personality traits. Some participants also completed the questionnaire again 28 days later, allowing the team to show that participants responded consistently across time.</p>
<p>Finally, to figure out how many people were friend addicts, the team again used criteria from past work, in which a person is considered “addicted” if they score at the midpoint or above on more than half of the questions. This revealed that 69% of respondents were addicted to their friends.</p>
<p>Should we be worried about this apparent friendship addiction crisis? Obviously not, say the researchers. “’Offline friend addiction’ is not an issue of concern for public health, but rather it is capturing experiences pertinent to social support, adaptation, and well-being across the lifespan,” they write.</p>
<p>But the point is that measures of social media addiction <em>also </em>capture these experiences. We might use social media to give or receive emotional support, for instance, or to hang out with our friends after a long day. Yet these scales don’t take this context into account. “What we have demonstrated here is that researchers can quickly produce farcical results when conceptualising social media as a distinctive entity that is unrelated to any other social context,” the team writes.</p>
<p>The work also highlights how easy — and potentially problematic — it is to claim that a scale is valid and use it to diagnose people when there aren’t actually any recognised diagnostic criteria to compare it against. Neither offline friend addiction nor social media addiction are formal psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Of course, in the current crisis the paper has taken on new relevance. Right now we are unable to see our “offline friends”, and for many of us the internet is the main means of communication. So perhaps, as psychologist Amy Orben <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">suggested to us</a> last month, we will begin to see the emergence of a more nuanced conversation about the benefits and risks of social media.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the team are not the first to develop a tongue-in-cheek measure to make a point about technology use. The term “Internet Addiction Disorder” was reportedly first coined in 1995 by psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg, who posted satirical diagnostic criteria for the new “disorder” to a psychology bulletin board. “To medicalize every behavior by putting it into psychiatric nomenclature is ridiculous”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/13/just-click-no">Goldberg told the <em>New Yorker</em></a> back in 1997. More than 20 years later, the authors of the new study conclude with a similar message: “We urge future social media research to focus on testing what components of social media use are distinct to offline social information seeking, especially when attempting to pathologise everyday behaviour.”</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>One of the most important and durable findings in moral and political psychology is that there is a tail-wags-the-dog aspect to human morality. Most of us like to think we have carefully thought-through, coherent moral systems that guide our behaviour and judgements. In reality our behaviour and judgements often stem from gut-level impulses, and only after the fact do we build elaborate moral rationales to justify what we believe and do.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> examines this issue through a fascinating lens: free will. Or, more specifically, via people’s judgments about how much free will others had when committing various transgressions. The team, led by Jim A. C. Everett of the University of Kent and Cory J. Clark of Durham University, ran 14 studies geared at evaluating the possibility that at least some of the time the moral tail wags the dog: first people decide whether someone is blameworthy, and <em>then</em> judge how much free will they have, in a way that allows them to justify blaming those they want to blame and excusing those they want to excuse.</p>
<p><span id="more-39454"></span>The researchers examined this hypothesis, for which there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660989">already some evidence</a>, through the lens of American partisan politics. In the paper they note that previous research has shown that conservatives have a greater belief in free will than liberals, and are more moralising in general (that is, they categorise a larger number of acts as morally problematic, and rely on a greater number of principles — or moral foundations — in making these judgements). The first two of the new studies replicated these findings — this is consistent with the idea, put simply, that conservatives believe in free will more because it allows them to level more moral judgements.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack in the remaining studies, but here are a few of the key findings:</p>
<p><strong>In Study 4</strong>, the researchers found that when it came to attribution of free will in instances that were viewed as “equally immoral for liberals and conservatives,” (such as spreading malicious rumours about a co-worker) there was no longer any correlation between participants’ political stance (liberal vs. conservative) and their evaluations of how much free will the transgressor had. This lends support to the idea that “differences in conservatives’ and liberals’ perception of free will may be partially due to differences in moralisation, rather than representing any generalised, abstract belief that human behaviours are freely chosen.”</p>
<p><strong>In Study 5</strong>, the researchers found that when they deliberately presented participants with hypothetical acts designed to be viewed as more immoral by liberals — such as “Robert sends a formal complaint to his child’s school after finding that his child’s kindergarten teacher is transgendered” — the normal pattern reversed itself, and it was now liberals who attributed more free will to the actors in question. (This finding was weaker, and only statistically significant when the researchers bumped up their sample beyond its initial size.)</p>
<p><strong>In Study 7</strong>, the researchers synthesised the aforementioned findings and randomly assigned online participants recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to situations in which the person committing a bad act was either described as liberal or conservative and as acting in order to achieve liberal or conservative goals. After confirming  that the MTurk respondents viewed moral harms against their own political group more harshly, the researchers also found “tentative — but weak — evidence” in favour of their overall hypothesis: liberal MTurkers viewed conservative bad actors as having more free will than bad-acting liberals, and conservative MTurkers viewed liberal bad actors  as having more free will than bad-acting conservatives. In short, when people take political actions that we morally disapprove of, we’re more inclined to believe they did it of their own volition. This bias afflicts conservatives more often, because they’re more morally disapproving, but can just as easily afflict liberals.</p>
<p>Some of the evidence is mixed, but overall the paper suggests that even judgments about free will (a complex philosophical concept that has been the subject of much debate and introspection) can’t escape the gut-impulse nature that underlies so much human moralising. Though preliminary, this is an important finding that could have ramifications for society. For one thing, if we have a tendency to view agents as more free when their bad acts offend us politically, but as less free when they don’t, that’s the sort of psychological tendency that could be echoed in law enforcement.</p>

<h4>How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg" />Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay</figure><p>We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>. Despite dating their last common ancestor with <em>Homo sapiens</em> to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in <em>Neuroscientus</em>. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.</p><p>Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics</p><h4>Mimics</h4><p>There are a number of species that attempt to mimic <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:</p><p><strong>Neurobollocker</strong></p><p>Sapiens that append the prefix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.</p><p><strong>Cranks</strong></p><p>A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em> sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.</p><h4>Sub-species</h4><p><strong>The Electrophysiologist</strong></p><p>The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other <em>Neuroscientus</em> by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.</p><p><strong>The Systems Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.</p><p>Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).</p><p><strong>The Cognitive Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:</p><p>Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.</p><p>Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.</p><p>The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).</p><p><strong>The Neuroanatomist</strong><br />Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.</p><p><strong>Neural Engineer</strong><br />Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.</p><p><strong>Behavioural Neuroscientist</strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).</p><p><strong>Neuroethologist </strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.</p><p><strong>Neuroendocrinologist</strong><br />Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.</p><p><strong>Molecular neuroscientist </strong><br />Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.</p><p><strong>Neurogeneticist</strong><br />Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.<br /> <br /><strong>Clinical Neuroscientist </strong><br />Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.</p><p><strong>Computational Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.</p><p>Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).</p><p>The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.</p><p>Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.</p><p>The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.</p><p><strong>Karl Friston</strong><br />Unclassifiable.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology/">The importance of character during war</a></h4>

<p>Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.</p><p>Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.</p><p>In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.</p><p>Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.</p><p>Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.</p><p>Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.</p><p>Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.</p><p>Featured photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Vladislav Nikonov</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/">The importance of character during war</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/confronting-mortality-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Confronting mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/music-schools-respond-to-covid-19-shutdown/" rel="nofollow">Music schools respond to COVID-19 shutdown</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why we like a good robot story</a></h4>

<p>Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.</p><p>This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.</p><p>In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.</p><p>Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.</p><p>At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.</p><p>But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.</p><p>This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.</p><p>Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”</p><p>But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.</p><p>Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.</p><p>Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8">Research </a>also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.</p><p>Isaac Asimov’s book, <em>I, Robot</em>, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.</p><p>All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”</p><ul><li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li><li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li></ul><p>But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.</p><p><em>I, Robot</em> stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.</p><p>The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, <em>I, Robot</em>, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.</p><p>Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics">granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship</a>. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.</p><p>Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.</p><p>Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001">one study</a> has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.</p><p>Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641">foresees a future</a> in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”</p><p>And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.</p><p>This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Andy Kelly from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/">Why we like a good robot story</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/music-schools-respond-to-covid-19-shutdown/" rel="nofollow">Music schools respond to COVID-19 shutdown</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JYqJBgwZHgw/">Learning how we can support researchers during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a couple of caveats.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Survey Structure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953" height="436" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png" width="1024" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the scale of the impact?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42952" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42952 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749</figure>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42954" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42954 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work</figure>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Serving authors on the front lines</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining priorities for career advancement</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a </span><a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate clearly to academics and researchers how they will modify research evaluation procedures for hiring, promotion, and tenure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS fully supports this appeal and urges all institutions and funders to join those who have already </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5REApf-t-76UXh8TKAGoLlwy8WIMfSSyqCJbb5u9lA/edit#gid=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consider similar policies to let researchers know that their careers will not grind to a halt due to the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to continue reviewing, editing, or revising manuscripts in process at PLOS, </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/03/a-message-to-our-community-regarding-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we encourage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you to reach out to the journal for an extension so that you can take the time you need to focus on other concerns.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is another way we can help support the communication and discovery of research as your publishing needs change, please consider sharing your thoughts by emailing us at </span><a href="mailto:community@pos.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community@plos.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by responding to </span><a href="https://surveys.plos.org/s3/covid-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. </span></p>

At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html">173 countries</a>, causing <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4">972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths</a>. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins">clinical trials</a> are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.</p>
<p>Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png" width="191" />Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732">Domestic violence</a>, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, <a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/">one in three women</a> experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1">4-12% </a>during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during <a href="https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588">emergencies</a> in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1">US</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC">globally</a>. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">from a diverse set of countries</a> and cultures, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">USA</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france">France</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19">Australia</a>, <a href="https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/">Nepal</a>, <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html">India</a>, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">South Africa</a>, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.</p>
<p>To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf">most common form</a> of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802">across generations</a>.</p>
<p>Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration</p></blockquote>
<p>First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/">livelihood loss</a> by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html">marital conflicts</a>. <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/">Cognitive burdens</a> (preoccupation with financial woes impedes <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11831" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg" width="300" />one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf">mental models</a>” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x">substance use</a> (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.</p>
<p>Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.</p>
<p>Third, homebound for long, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html">couples</a>, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints</p></blockquote>
<p>As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.</p>
<p>First, a financial safety net (for example, <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=carsey">unemployment insurance in the US</a>, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms">women</a>, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg" width="256" />y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study">legal protection against domestic violence</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">global surge</a> in domestic violence could be <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls">costly</a>, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.</p>

Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction<div id="content"><p>Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/">QuantLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine">Open Source Risk Engine</a> (ORE), <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system">libbitcoin</a>and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc99cdfe"><h2 id="orgc99cdfe">About</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc99cdfe"><p>Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a <i>deep understanding</i>of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: <i>wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></h4>

<p>Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up">Introduction to Psychology</a>, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology</em> in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”</p><p>Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html">Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It</a>” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.</p><p>Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.</p><figure><img height="354" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg" width="607" />Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.</figure><p>Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness"><em>The Question of Animal Awareness</em></a> of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.</p><p>To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf"><em>Investigation of Mind in Animals</em></a> by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as <em>Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses</em>. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.</p><figure><img height="398" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg" width="587" />Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls. Used with permission from Penn State Library.</figure><p>World War II fully exposed the catastrophic cost of national arrogance. International science advanced in its wake. Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.</p><p><em>Featured image from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/confronting-mortality-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Confronting mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/music-schools-respond-to-covid-19-shutdown/" rel="nofollow">Music schools respond to COVID-19 shutdown</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/02/scraping-webpages-with-developer-tools-and-selenium/">Scraping webpages with developer tools and Selenium</a></h4>

<p>There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.</p>



<h2>Identifying targets with developer tools</h2>



<p>Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:</p>



<ul><li>Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage</li><li>See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript</li><li>Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage</li><li>Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML</li></ul>



<p>These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.</p>



<p>Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7487" data-attachment-id="7487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scraping" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png" data-orig-size="3070,1752" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/scraping/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>Here I find that the biggest headline is a <code>span</code> with a class name of <code>balancedHeadline</code>. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.</p>



<h2>Selenium: remote control browsers</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium</a>: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></code> to grab the data and parsing it with <code><a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup</a></code>. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:</p>



<ul><li>is dynamically loaded</li><li>is hidden behind authentication layers</li><li>requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript</li></ul>



<p>In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">pip install selenium</pre>



<p>Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html">I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">downloading the gecko webdriver</a> and extracting the binary to <code>/usr/bin</code>. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

</pre>


<p>Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7477" data-attachment-id="7477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nytimes-robot" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png" data-orig-size="2176,192" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" />A remote-controlled version of Firefox</figure>



<p>We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: </p>



<ul><li>We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   <code>document.querySelectorAll("span.balancedHeadline")</code> to grab the headline</li><li>We could read the DOM to find the right span</li></ul>



<p>Let’s use the second method:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h2>Running headless and automating</h2>



<p>Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h3>Cron job</h3>



<p>All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called <code>headless-browser</code>, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;&amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;&amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
</pre>


<p>I saved this file as <code>/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh</code>. Running  <code>crontab -e</code>, I added an entry that looks like this:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate"># m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
</pre>


<p><a href="https://crontab.guru/">You can use this website</a> to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating">you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service</a> instead.</p>



<h2>Authentication</h2>



<p>A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with <code>.default</code> with:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
</pre>


<p>In my case, I found a directory called <code>lasd74g9.default</code>. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()

</pre>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/">is limited</a>, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.</p>
<p><strong>Our studies </strong></p>
<p>In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png" width="157" />and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.</p>
<p>Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11812" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Content analysis</strong></p>
<p>We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.</p>
<p>Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Are our results surprising?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.</p>
<blockquote><p>HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.</p>
<p>This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/">alcohol</a> and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/">energy-dense snacks</a>. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru will talk about her project named "Cyberspecies Proximity" on which she is working together with Alex May.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.</p>
<p>The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.</p>
<p>The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.</p>
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its launch in 2003, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To lead this new phase for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Welcome, Nonia Pariente!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Microbiology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now as Editor-in-Chief of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”</span></i></p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SrNSAlYYdMg/">PLOS ONE publishes additional Coronavirus-related papers</a></h4>

<p>Today <em>PLOS ONE</em> added to its <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">collection</a> of COVID-19 papers since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405">study</a> was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.</p>
<p>Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>
<p>We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">Collection</a> as they publish. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks to also consider posting a <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint">Preprint</a>.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard">search link</a>.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/sweets-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><em>Are your kids addicted to sugar? </em>Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should eat less than six teaspoons of added sugar per day on average. This adds up to around <strong>25 grams</strong> of sugar. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or <strong>2,800 excess</strong> <strong>sugar</strong> <strong>cubes</strong> per year.</p>
<p>This has instigated the ‘sugar smart’ campaign led by PHE which is aimed at raising awareness of the amount of sugars in foods and drinks and to encourage parents to reduce their children’s sugar consumption. ‘<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/change4life">Change4life</a>‘ is England’s first national social marketing campaign, promoting the following the slogan “Eat Well, Move More, Live Longer”.</p>

<p>The Change4Life Sugar Smart campaign was launched on January 4th 2016. TV, billboard and digital advertising ran for six weeks to support the campaign. A Sugar Smart app was available for parents to download free of charge. The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">A recent study</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.</p>
<p><em>Targeting the parents:</em></p>
<p>The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.</p>
<p>Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.</p>
<p>Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.</p>
<p>Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></h4>

<p>Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/">Survey of Earned Doctorates </a>55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.</p><p>To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.</p><p>As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.</p><p>One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Knowledge in chosen field</li><li>Motivation and perseverance toward goals</li><li>Ability to work independently</li><li>Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing</li><li>Ability/potential for college teaching</li><li>Ability to plan and conduct research</li></ul><p>For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).</p><p>How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:</p><figure><img height="288" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg" width="682" />Image credit: Peter Érdi</figure><p>I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.</p><p>Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.</p><p>The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.</p><p>If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Joshua Golde from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arXiv now offers a <a href="https://arxiv.org/covid19search">quick search link to all coronavirus and COVID-19 research</a> hosted on <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>. The search results are sorted by date, with the most recent papers at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Also new on the arXiv homepage is an external link to<a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"> medRxiv and bioRxiv</a> preprints about the coronavirus and COVID-19.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_589" style="width: 430px;"><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links.png"><img alt="arXiv COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page" class="wp-image-589" height="116" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links-300x81.png" width="430" /></a>COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page</figure>
<p>“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”</p>
<p>As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.</p>
<p>“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of<a href="http://tech.cornell.edu"> Cornell Tech</a>. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”</p>
<p>The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords. In the interest of expediency, we are providing a direct curated link to e-prints with the most commonly used tags.”</p>
<p>Like other preprint servers, arXiv does not facilitate in-depth peer-review and does not specifically endorse the contents of the documents it hosts. Results on <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a> should be considered preliminary and not used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. Likewise, such findings should not be reported in the news media as established information.</p>

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.<br /><br />The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852">Bourouiba, 2020</a>). The puff trapped droplets of many sizes and carried them quite a long distance (23-26 feet!) while evading evaporation. Droplets that settle can contaminate surfaces.

<p>As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.</p><p><strong>First and foremost – plan</strong><br />More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, are another source of trusted information.</p><p><strong>Disconnect to reconnect</strong><br />After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.</p><p>Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.</p><p><strong>Maintain your foundation</strong><br />Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.</p><p><strong>Reconnect with natural joys</strong><br />Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude and altruism</strong><br />Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.</p><p>The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.</p><p><strong>Know when to seek help</strong><br />Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources">a list of trusted resources</a> and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm"><em>Photo</em></a><em> </em><em>by prostooleh via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-the-covid-19-pandemic-feels-like-a-movie/" rel="nofollow">Why the COVID-19 pandemic feels like a movie</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/music-schools-respond-to-covid-19-shutdown/" rel="nofollow">Music schools respond to COVID-19 shutdown</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.</p>

<p>Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:</p>



<ul><li>evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods</li><li>locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets</li></ul>



<p>Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.</p>



<h3>The theory behind reverse correlation</h3>



<p>Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up <a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf">writing my PhD thesis on systems identification</a>, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.</p>



<p>There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097">Franz &amp; Schölkopf (2006)</a>. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="N" /> real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" />:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" /></p>



<p>Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system <img alt="f(\bold x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x)" /> as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" /></p>



<p>Note that the kernels <img alt="h_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_i" /> have increasing order: <img alt="h_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_0" /> is a scalar, <img alt="h_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_1" /> a vector, <img alt="h_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_2" /> a matrix, <img alt="h_3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_3" /> a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion</p></blockquote>



<p>The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function <img alt="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" /> has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb">Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png" />Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.</figure>



<p>This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.</p></blockquote>



<p>To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series">Wiener expansion</a>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" /></p>



<p>And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E_D%5BG_i%28x%29G_j%28x%29%5D+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+i+%5Cne+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" /></p>



<p>Here <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:</p>



<ol><li>Set <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 0</li><li>Set <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 1, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> from <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to make <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> orthogonal to <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /></li><li>Set <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 2, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> and <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> from <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to make <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> orthogonal to both, etc.</li></ol>



<p>This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, <img alt="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" />. Thus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" /></p>



<p>Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:</p>



<ol><li>Estimate the Wiener kernel <img alt="k_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_0" /> from the measured response <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" /></li><li>Project the 0’th order functional out of <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" /> to obtain <img alt="y_{res}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y_{res}" /></li><li>Estimate the Wiener kernel <img alt="k_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_1" /> from the residual <img alt="y_{res}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y_{res}" />, etc.</li></ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.</p></blockquote>



<p>What does <em>estimate</em> mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" /></p>



<p>For the first-order kernel:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" /></p>



<p>Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, <img alt="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" />. The second order kernel is a little more tricky.

Notice the <img alt="i!" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="i!" /> factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb">This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion</a>.</p>



<p>Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:</p>



<ol><li>Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.</li><li>The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.</li><li>The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.</li></ol>



<p>The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:</p>



<ol><li>Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood</li><li>Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise</li><li>Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood</li><li>Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent</li></ol>



<p>Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>Evolution strategies (ES)</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies">Evolution strategies</a> (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a <em>smoothed</em> gradient via the ES method.</p>



<p>The setup is quite clever. We have a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative <img alt="\nabla f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla f(z)" /> directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, <img alt="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" /> in a local neighborhood <img alt="\pi(\theta, z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi(\theta, z)" />. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.</p>



<p>To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" /></p>



<p>The last equality, which is also called the <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/">log-derivative trick</a>, is derived from:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" /></p>



<p>A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" /></p>



<p>Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking ES to reverse correlation</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png" /><a href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/">From the OpenAI blog</a>.</figure>



<p>The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).</p>



<p>ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.</p>



<p>ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)</a>. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.</li><li><a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html">NES (Natural evolution strategies)</a>. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.</li></ul>



<p>Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.</p>



<p>Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction">variance reduction literature</a> to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb">This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus</a>.</p>



<h3>Locally interpretable models</h3>



<p>There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html">locally interpretable models</a>. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size). The dashed line is the learned explanationthat is locally (but not globally) faithful.

<p>In general, we try to find a model <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> which approximates a complex function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> according to a weight window <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi" />:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3D+%5Csum_i+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cx_i+-+a%7C%7C%5E2%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29+%28f%28x_i%29+-+g%28x_i%29%29+%5E+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2" /></p>

For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as <img alt="\Omega(g)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(g)" />. The model class <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G" /> can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:</p>



<ul><li>a GAM</li><li>a decision tree</li><li>a linear model</li></ul>



<p>If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking LIME to reverse correlation</h4>



<p>An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.</p>



<p>Many articles have documented that <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short">receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles</a>, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.</p>



<p>Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:</p>



<ul><li>the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)</li><li>the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)</li><li>the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)</li></ul>



<p>Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Local linearization of receptive fields" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png" />From <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489">Movshon et al. 1978</a>.</figure>



<p>There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589">A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features</a> that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).</p>



<p>Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short">explain sensory neurons</a> and to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">compress neural networks</a>.</p>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.</p>

However, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227">rate of TOLAC is decreasing</a>, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">risk of uterine rupture</a> is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.</p>
<p>We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> showed promising results.</p>
<h3><strong>Our criteria</strong></h3>
<p>Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.</p>

</table>
<p>We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.</p>
<h3><strong>High success rate</strong></h3>
<p>Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).</p>
<blockquote><p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors associated with failed TOLAC</strong></h3>
<p>This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.</p>
<p>Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267">risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes</a> in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.</p>
<p>Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.</p>
<p>A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11795 aligncenter" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg" width="620" />
<p>Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.</p>
<p>School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.</p>

<p>Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.</p>

<p>People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11777" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg" width="300" />of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.</p>

Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.</p>
