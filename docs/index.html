For a a PGD diagnosis, an individual must have at least one of two <i>Cluster I</i> symptoms and at least three of five <i>Cluster II</i> symptoms. This is a rather stunning degree of symptom heterogeneity, and much more complicated than the <b>Infographic</b> suggests. It might even limit the usefulness of these diagnostic categories, which may be true of psychiatric diagnoses in general (see <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" target="_blank">RDoC</a>). <br /><br />Here is where computational methods may assist with understanding symptom profiles and trajectories of grief (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34261030" target="_blank">Malgaroli et al., 2022</a>). Data driven analyses using unsupervised machine learning methods can identify patterns within the heterogeneity. Network analyses have identified the centrality of loneliness (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730514/" target="_blank">Fried et al., 2015</a>) and a social/identity symptom cluster that includes role confusion and meaninglessness (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/symptoms-of-persistent-complex-bereavement-disorder-depression-and-ptsd-in-a-conjugally-bereaved-sample-a-network-analysis/0E8F5F15FDA0AA6AB87892F77A0284D4" target="_blank">Malgaroli et al., 2018</a>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">We finally have a fully complete human genome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers have finally deciphered a complete human genetic instruction book from cover to cover.</p>



<p>The completion of the human genome has been announced a couple of times in the past, but those were actually incomplete drafts. “We really mean it this time,” says Evan Eichler, a human geneticist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>The completed genome is presented in a series of papers published online March 31 in <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature Methods</em>.</p>





<p>An international team of researchers, including Eichler, used new DNA sequencing technology to untangle repetitive stretches of DNA that were redacted from an earlier version of the genome, widely used as a reference for guiding biomedical research. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Deciphering those tricky stretches <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987">adds about 200 million DNA bases, about 8 percent of the genome</a>, to the instruction book, researchers report in <em>Science</em>. That’s essentially an entire chapter. And it’s a juicy one, containing the first-ever looks at the short arms of some chromosomes, long-lost genes and important parts of chromosomes called centromeres — where machinery responsible for divvying up DNA grips the chromosome.</p>



<p>“Some of the regions that were missing actually turn out to be the most interesting,” says Rajiv McCoy, a human geneticist at Johns Hopkins University, who was part of the team known as the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium assembling the complete genome. “It’s exciting because we get to take the first look inside these regions and see what we can find.” Telomeres are repetitive stretches of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes. Like aglets on shoelaces, they may help keep chromosomes from unraveling.</p>



<p>Data from the effort are already available for other researchers to explore. And some, like geneticist Ting Wang of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, have already delved in. “Having a complete genome reference definitely improves biomedical studies.… It’s an extremely useful resource,” he says. “There’s no question that this is an important achievement.”</p>



<p>But, Wang says, “the human genome isn’t quite complete yet.”</p>



<p>To understand why and what this new volume of the human genetic encyclopedia tells us, here’s a closer look at the milestone.</p>





<h4>What did the researchers do?</h4>



<p>Eichler is careful to point out that “this is the completion of <em>a</em> human genome. There is no such thing as <em>the</em> human genome.” Any two people will have large portions of their genomes that range from very similar to virtually identical and “smaller portions that are wildly different.” A reference genome can help researchers see where people differ, which can point to genes that may be involved in diseases. Having a view of the entire genome, with no gaps or hidden DNA, may give scientists a better understanding of human health, disease and evolution.</p>



<p>The newly complete genome doesn’t have gaps like the previous human reference genome. But it still has limitations, Wang says. The old reference genome is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">conglomerate of more than 60 people’s DNA</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). “Not a single individual, or single cell on this planet, has that genome.” That goes for the new, complete genome, too. &nbsp;“It’s a quote-unquote fake genome,” says Wang, who was not involved with the project.</p>



<p>The new genome doesn’t come from a person either. It’s the genome of a complete hydatidiform mole, a sort of tumor that arises when a sperm fertilizes an empty egg and the father’s chromosomes are duplicated. The researchers chose to decipher the complete genome from a cell line called CHM13 made from one of these unusual tumors.</p>



<p>That decision was made for a technical reason, says geneticist Karen Miga of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Usually, people get one set of chromosomes from their mother and another set from their father. So “we all have two genomes in every cell.”</p>



<p>If putting together a genome is like assembling a puzzle, “you essentially have two puzzles in the same box that look very similar to each other,” says Miga, borrowing an analogy from a colleague. Researchers would have to sort the two puzzles before piecing them together. “Genomes from hydatidiform moles don’t present that same challenge. It’s just one puzzle in the box.”</p>



<p>The researchers did have to add the Y chromosome from another person, because the sperm that created the hydatidiform mole carried an X chromosome.</p>



<p>Even putting one puzzle together is a Herculean task. But new technologies that allow researchers to put DNA bases — represented by the letters A, T, C and G — in order, can spit out stretches up to more than 100,000 bases long. Just as children’s puzzles are easier to solve because of larger and fewer pieces, these “long reads” made assembling the bits of the genome easier, especially in repetitive parts where just a few bases might distinguish one copy from another. The bigger pieces also allowed researchers to correct some mistakes in the old reference genome.</p>



<h4>What did they find?</h4>



<p>For starters, the newly deciphered DNA contains the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. These “acrocentric chromosomes” don’t resemble nice, neat X’s the way the rest of the chromosomes do. Instead, they have a set of long arms and one of  nubby short arms.</p>



<p>The length of the short arms belies their importance. These arms are home to rDNA genes, which encode rRNAs, which are key components of complex molecular machines called ribosomes. Ribosomes read genetic instructions and build all the proteins needed to make cells and bodies work. There are hundreds of copies of these rDNA regions in every person’s genome, an average of 315, but some people have more and some fewer. They’re important for making sure cells have protein-building factories at the ready.</p>



<p>“We didn’t know what to expect in these regions,” Miga says. “We found that every acrocentric chromosome, and every rDNA on that acrocentric chromosome, had variants, changes to the repeat unit that was private to that particular chromosome.”</p>



<p>By using fluorescent tags, Eichler and colleagues discovered that repetitive DNA next to the rDNA regions — and perhaps the rDNA too — sometimes <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6965">switches places to land on another chromosome</a>, the team reports in <em>Science</em>. “It’s like musical chairs,” he says. Why and how that happens is still a mystery.</p>



<p>The complete genome also contains 3,604 genes, including 104 that encode proteins, that weren’t present in the old, incomplete genome. Many of those genes are slightly different copies of previously known genes, including some that have been implicated in brain evolution and development, autism, immune responses, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Having a map of where all these genes lie may lead to a better understanding of what they do, and perhaps even of what makes humans human.</p>



<p>One of the biggest finds may be the structure of all of the human centromeres. Centromeres, the pinched portions which give most chromosomes their characteristic X shape, are the assembly points for kinetochores, the cellular machinery that divvies up DNA during cell division. That’s one of the most important jobs in a cell. When it goes wrong, birth defects, cancer or death can result. Researchers had already deciphered the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fruit-fly-jumping-gene-chromosome-centromere">centromeres of fruit flies</a> and the human 8, X and Y chromosomes (<em>SN: 5/17/19</em>), but this is the first time that researchers got a glimpse of the rest of the human centromeres.</p>



<p>The structures are mostly head-to-tail repeats of about 171 base pairs of DNA known as alpha satellites. But those repeats are nestled within other repeats, creating complex patterns that distinguish each chromosome’s individual centromere, Miga and colleagues describe in <em>Science</em>. Knowing the structures will help researchers learn more about how chromosomes are divvied up and what sometimes throws off the process.</p>

<p>Researchers also now have a more complete map of epigenetic marks — chemical tags on DNA or associated proteins that may change how genes are regulated. One type of epigenetic mark, known as DNA methylation, is fairly abundant across the centromeres, except for one spot in each chromosome called the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj5089">centromeric dip region</a>, Winston Timp, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University and colleagues report in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Those dips are where kinetochores grab the DNA, the researchers discovered. But it&#8217;s not yet clear whether the dip in methylation causes the cellular machinery to assemble in that spot or if assembly of the machinery leads to lower levels of methylation.</p>



<p>Examining DNA methylation patterns in multiple people’s DNA and comparing them with the new reference revealed that the dips occur at different spots in each person’s centromeres, though the consequences of that aren’t known.</p>



<p>About half of genes implicated in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-tweaks-built-humans-bigger-brains">evolution of humans’ large, wrinkly brains</a> are found in multiple copies in the newly uncovered repetitive parts of the genome (<em>SN: 2/26/15</em>). Overlaying the epigenetic maps on the reference allowed researchers to figure out which of many copies of those genes were turned on and off, says Ariel Gershman, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>“That gives us a little bit more insight into which of them are actually important and playing a functional role in the development of the human brain,” Gershman says. “That was exciting for us, because there’s never been a reference that was accurate enough in these [repetitive] regions to tell which gene was which, and which ones are turned on or off.”</p>



<h4>What is next?</h4>



<p>One criticism of genetics research is that it has relied too heavily on DNA from people of European descent. CHM13 also has European heritage. But researchers have used the new reference to discover new patterns of genetic diversity. Using DNA data collected from thousands of people of diverse backgrounds who participated in earlier research projects compared with the T2T reference, researchers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl3533">more easily and accurately found places where people differ</a>, McCoy and colleagues report in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium has now teamed up with Wang and his colleagues to make <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">complete genomes of 350 people</a> from diverse backgrounds (<em>SN: 2/22/21</em>). That effort, known as the pangenome project, is poised to reveal some of its first findings later this year, Wang says.</p>



<p>McCoy and Timp say that it may take some time, but eventually, researchers may switch from using the old reference genome to the more complete and accurate T2T reference. “It’s like upgrading to a new version of software,” Timp says. “Not everyone is going to want to do it right away.”</p>



<p>The completed human genome will also be useful for researchers studying other organisms, says Amanda Larracuente, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Rochester in New York who was not involved in the project. “What I’m excited about is the techniques and tools this team has developed, and being able to apply those to study other species.”</p>



<p>Eichler and others already have plans to make complete genomes of chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes to learn more about how humans evolved differently than apes did. “No one should see this as the end,” Eichler says, “but a transformation, not only for genomic research but for clinical medicine, though that will take years to achieve.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils">Mammals’ bodies outpaced their brains right after the dinosaurs died</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern mammals are known for their big brains. But new analyses of mammal skulls from creatures that lived shortly after the dinosaur mass extinction shows that those brains weren’t always a foregone conclusion. For at least 10 million years after the dinosaurs disappeared, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl5584">mammals got a lot brawnier but not brainier</a>, researchers report in the April 1 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That bucks conventional wisdom, to put it mildly. “I thought, it’s not possible, there must be something that I did wrong,” says Ornella Bertrand, a mammal paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. “It really threw me off. How am I going to explain that they were not smart?”</p>



<p>Modern mammals have the largest brains in the animal kingdom relative to their body size. How and when that brain evolution happened is a mystery. One idea has been that the disappearance of all nonbird dinosaurs following an asteroid impact at the end of the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive">left a vacuum for mammals to fill</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>). Recent discoveries of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid">fossils dating to the Paleocene</a> — the immediately post-extinction epoch spanning 66 million to 56 million years ago — does reveal a flourishing menagerie of weird and wonderful mammal species, many much bigger than their Mesozoic predecessors. It was the dawn of the Age of Mammals.</p>

<p>Before those fossil finds, the prevailing wisdom was that in the wake of the mass dino extinction, mammals’ brains most likely grew apace with their bodies, everything increasing together like an expanding balloon, Bertrand says. But those discoveries of Paleocene fossil troves in Colorado and New Mexico, as well as reexaminations of fossils previously found in France, are now unraveling that story, by offering scientists the chance to actually measure the size of mammals’ brains over time.</p>



<p>Bertrand and her colleagues used CT scanning to create 3-D images of the skulls of different types of ancient mammals from both before and after the extinction event. Those specimens included mammals from 17 groups dating to the Paleocene and 17 to the Eocene, the epoch that spanned 55 million to 34 million years ago. &nbsp;</p>





<p>What the team found was a shock: Relative to their body sizes, Paleocene mammal brains were relatively <em>smaller</em> than those of Mesozoic mammals. It wasn’t until the Eocene that mammal brains began to grow, particularly in certain sensory regions, the team reports.</p>



<p>To assess how the sizes and shapes of those sensory regions also changed over time, Bertrand looked for the edges of different parts of the brains within the 3-D skull models, tracing them like a sculptor working with clay. The size of mammals’ olfactory bulbs, responsible for sense of smell, didn’t change over time, the researchers found — and that makes sense, because even Mesozoic mammals were good sniffers, she says.</p>



<p>The really big brain changes were to come in the neocortex, which is responsible for visual processing, memory and motor control, among other skills. But those kinds of changes are metabolically costly, Bertrand says. “To have a big brain, you need to sleep and eat, and if you don’t do that you get cranky, and your brain just doesn’t function.”</p>

<p>So, the team proposes, as the world shook off the dust of the mass extinction, brawn was the priority for mammals, helping them swiftly spread out into newly available ecological niches. But after 10 million years or so, the metabolic calculations had changed, and competition within those niches was ramping up. As a result, mammals began to develop new sets of skills that could help them snag hard-to-reach fruit from a branch, escape a predator or catch prey.</p>



<p>Other factors — such as social behavior or parental care — have been important to the overall evolution of mammals’ big brains. But these new finds suggest that, at least at the dawn of the Age of Mammals, ecology — and competition between species — <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/fe69abf1aae813d2/Documents/Science%20News/Paleontology/10.1126/science.abo1985">gave a big push to brain evolution</a>, wrote biologist Felisa Smith of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“An exciting aspect of these findings is that they raise a new question: Why did large brains evolve independently and concurrently in many mammal groups?” says evolutionary biologist David Grossnickle of the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>Most modern mammals have relatively large brains, so studies that examine only modern species might conclude that large brains evolved once in mammal ancestors, Grossnickle says. But what this study uncovered is a “much more interesting and nuanced story,” that these brains evolved separately in many different groups, he says. And that shows just how important fossils can be to stitching together an accurate tapestry of evolutionary history.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientific-imagination-failure-atoms-gravitational-waves-nuclear-power">Here are the Top 10 times scientific imagination failed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science, some would say, is an enterprise that should concern itself solely with cold, hard facts. Flights of imagination should be the province of philosophers and poets.</p>



<p>On the other hand, as <a href="https://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s6908.pdf">Albert Einstein so astutely observed</a>, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Knowledge, he said, is limited to what we know now, while “imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress.”</p>



<p>So with science, imagination has often been the prelude to transformative advances in knowledge, remaking humankind’s understanding of the world and enabling powerful new technologies.</p>





<p>And yet while sometimes spectacularly successful, imagination has also frequently failed in ways that retard the revealing of nature’s secrets. Some minds, it seems, are simply incapable of imagining that there’s more to reality than what they already know.</p>



<p>On many occasions scientists have failed to foresee ways of testing novel ideas, ridiculing them as unverifiable and therefore unscientific. Consequently it is not too challenging to come up with enough failures of scientific imagination to compile a Top 10 list, beginning with:</p>



<h4>10. Atoms</h4>



<p>By the middle of the 19th century, most scientists believed in atoms. Chemists especially. John Dalton had shown that the simple ratios of different elements making up chemical compounds strongly implied that each element consisted of identical tiny particles. Subsequent research on the weights of those atoms made their reality pretty hard to dispute. But that didn’t deter physicist-philosopher Ernst Mach. Even as late as the beginning of the 20th century, he and a number of others insisted that atoms could not be real, as they were not accessible to the senses. Mach believed that atoms were a “mental artifice,” convenient fictions that helped in calculating the outcomes of chemical reactions. “Have you ever seen one?” he would ask.</p>



<p>Apart from the fallacy of defining reality as “observable,” Mach’s main failure was his inability to imagine a way that atoms could be observed. Even after Einstein proved the existence of atoms by indirect means in 1905, Mach stood his ground. He was unaware, of course, of the 20th century technologies that quantum mechanics would enable, and so did not foresee powerful new microscopes that could show <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/individual-atoms-photographed">actual images of atoms</a> (and allow a certain computing company to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/344524a0">drag them around</a> to spell out IBM).</p>



<h4>9. Composition of stars</h4>



<p>Mach’s views were similar to those of Auguste Comte, a French philosopher who originated the idea of positivism, which denies reality to anything other than objects of sensory experience. Comte’s philosophy led (and in some cases still leads) many scientists astray. His greatest failure of imagination was an example he offered for what science could never know: the chemical composition of the stars.</p>



<p>Unable to imagine anybody affording a ticket on some entrepreneur’s space rocket, Comte argued in 1835 that the identity of the stars’ components <a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2010JAHH...13...90H">would forever remain beyond human knowledge</a>. We could study their size, shapes and movements, he said, “whereas we would never know how to study by any means their chemical composition, or their mineralogical structure,” or for that matter, their temperature, which “will necessarily always be concealed from us.”</p>



<p>Within a few decades, though, a newfangled technology called spectroscopy enabled astronomers to analyze the colors of light emitted by stars. And since each chemical element emits (or absorbs) precise colors (or frequencies) of light, each set of colors is like a chemical fingerprint, an infallible indicator for an element’s identity. Using a spectroscope to observe starlight therefore can reveal the chemistry of the stars, exactly what Comte thought impossible.</p>



<h4>8. Canals on Mars</h4>



<p>Sometimes imagination fails because of its overabundance rather than absence. In the case of the never-ending drama over the possibility of life on Mars, that planet’s famous canals turned out to be figments of overactive scientific imagination.</p>



<p>First “observed” in the late 19th century, the Martian canals showed up as streaks on the planet’s surface, described as <em>canali</em> by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. <em>Canali</em> is, however, Italian for channels, not canals. So in this case something was gained (rather than lost) in translation — the idea that Mars was inhabited. “Canals are dug,” <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55546/55546-h/55546-h.htm#ASTRONOMY">remarked British astronomer Norman Lockyer in 1901</a>, “<em>ergo</em> there were diggers.” Soon astronomers imagined an elaborate system of canals transporting water from Martian poles to thirsty metropolitan areas and agricultural centers. (Some observers even imagined seeing canals on Venus and Mercury.)</p>

<p>With more constrained imaginations, aided by better telescopes and translations, belief in the Martian canals eventually faded. It was merely the Martian winds blowing dust (bright) and sand (dark) around the surface in ways that occasionally made bright and dark streaks line up in a deceptive manner — to eyes attached to overly imaginative brains.</p>



<h4>7. Nuclear fission</h4>



<p>In 1934, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi bombarded uranium (atomic number 92) and other elements with neutrons, the particle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutron-atomic-brick-may-solve-mystery-cosmic-rays">discovered just two years earlier</a> by James Chadwick. Fermi found that among the products was an unidentifiable new element. He thought he had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/italian-discovery-may-be-first-super-elements">created element 93</a>, heavier than uranium. He could not imagine any other explanation. In 1938 Fermi was awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1938/summary/">Nobel Prize in physics</a> for demonstrating “the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation.”</p>



<p>It turned out, however, that Fermi had unwittingly demonstrated nuclear fission. His bombardment products were actually lighter, previously known elements — fragments split from the heavy uranium nucleus. Of course, the scientists later <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-energy-released">credited with discovering fission</a>, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, didn’t understand their results either. Hahn’s former collaborator Lise Meitner was the one who explained what they’d done. Another woman, chemist Ida Noddack, <a href="http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/num3/num3%20p15-16.pdf">had imagined the possibility of fission</a> to explain Fermi’s results, but for some reason nobody listened to her.</p>



<h4>6. Detecting neutrinos</h4>



<p>In the 1920s, most physicists had convinced themselves that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">nature was built from just two basic particles</a>: positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Some had, however, imagined the possibility of a particle with no electric charge. One specific proposal for such a particle came in 1930 from Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli. He suggested that a no-charge particle could explain a suspicious loss of energy observed in beta-particle radioactivity. Pauli’s idea was worked out mathematically by Fermi, who named the neutral particle the neutrino. Fermi’s math was then examined by physicists Hans Bethe and Rudolf Peierls, who deduced that the neutrino would zip through matter so easily that there was no imaginable way of detecting its existence (short of building a tank of liquid hydrogen 6 million billion miles wide). “There is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino,” <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5baAG1WqgYQC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=Bethe+Peierls+neutrino+%22no+practically+possible+way%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9B4IiCxuwe&amp;sig=ACfU3U0eVlGt4G8dIuzdHJLwBFx8_UMA4g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiei_6Ts9r2AhVXhXIEHfHdDXwQ6AF6BAgkEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Bethe%20Peierls%20neutrino%20%22no%20practically%20possible%20way%22&amp;f=false">Bethe and Peierls concluded</a>.</p>



<p>But they had failed to imagine the possibility of finding a source of huge numbers of high-energy neutrinos, so that a few could be captured even if almost all escaped. No such source was known until nuclear fission reactors were invented. In the 1950s, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan used reactors to definitely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutrinos-confirmed">establish the neutrino’s existence</a>. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/reines-lecture.pdf">Reines later said</a> he sought a way to detect the neutrino precisely because everybody had told him it wasn’t possible to detect the neutrino. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>5. Nuclear energy</h4>



<p>Ernest Rutherford, one of the 20th century’s greatest experimental physicists, was not exactly unimaginative. He imagined the existence of the neutron a dozen years before it was discovered, and he figured out that a weird experiment conducted by his assistants had revealed that atoms contained a dense central nucleus. It was clear that the atomic nucleus packed an enormous quantity of energy, but Rutherford could imagine no way to extract that energy for practical purposes. In 1933, at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he noted that although the nucleus contained a lot of energy, it would also require energy to release it. Anyone saying we can exploit atomic energy “is talking moonshine,” <a href="https://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/660212">Rutherford declared</a>. To be fair, Rutherford qualified the moonshine remark by saying “with our present knowledge,” so in a way he perhaps was anticipating the discovery of nuclear fission a few years later. (And <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhP....13..128J/abstract">some historians have suggested</a> that Rutherford did imagine the powerful release of nuclear energy, but thought it was a bad idea and wanted to discourage people from attempting it.)&nbsp;</p>

<h4>4. Age of the Earth</h4>



<p>Rutherford’s reputation for imagination was bolstered by his inference that radioactive matter deep underground could solve the mystery of the age of the Earth. In the mid-19th century, William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) calculated the Earth’s age to be something a little more than 100 million years, and possibly much less. Geologists insisted that the Earth must be much older — perhaps billions of years — to account for the planet’s geological features.</p>



<p>Kelvin calculated his estimate assuming the Earth was born as a molten rocky mass that then cooled to its present temperature. But following the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the 19th century, Rutherford pointed out that it provided a new source of heat in the Earth’s interior. While giving a talk (in Kelvin’s presence), Rutherford suggested that Kelvin had basically prophesized a new source of planetary heat.</p>



<p>While Kelvin’s neglect of radioactivity is the standard story, <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/kelvin-perry-and-the-age-of-the-earth">a more thorough analysis</a> shows that adding that heat to his math would not have changed his estimate very much. Rather, Kelvin’s mistake was assuming the interior to be rigid. John Perry (one of Kelvin’s former assistants) showed in 1895 that the flow of heat deep within the Earth’s interior would alter Kelvin’s calculations considerably — enough to allow the Earth to be billions of years old. It turned out that the Earth’s mantle is fluid on long time scales, which not only explains the age of the Earth, but also plate tectonics.</p>



<h4>3. Charge-parity violation</h4>



<p>Before the mid-1950s, nobody imagined that the laws of physics gave a hoot about handedness. The same laws should govern matter in action when viewed straight-on or in a mirror, just as the rules of baseball applied equally to Ted Williams and Willie Mays, not to mention Mickey Mantle. But in 1956 physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang suggested that perfect right-left symmetry (or “parity”) might be violated by the weak nuclear force, and experiments <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-atomic-matter-laws">soon confirmed their suspicion</a>.</p>



<p>Restoring sanity to nature, many physicists thought, required antimatter. If you just switched left with right (mirror image), some subatomic processes exhibited a preferred handedness. But if you also replaced matter with antimatter (switching electric charge), left-right balance would be restored. In other words, reversing both charge (C) and parity (P) left nature’s behavior unchanged, a principle known as CP symmetry. CP symmetry had to be perfectly exact; otherwise nature’s laws would change if you went backward (instead of forward) in time, and nobody could imagine that.</p>



<p>In the early 1960s, James Cronin and Val Fitch tested CP symmetry’s perfection by studying subatomic particles called kaons and their antimatter counterparts. Kaons and antikaons both have zero charge but are not identical, because they are made from different quarks. Thanks to the quirky rules of quantum mechanics, kaons can turn into antikaons and vice versa. If CP symmetry is exact, each should turn into the other equally often. But Cronin and Fitch found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/invariance-theory-upset">antikaons turn into kaons more often</a> than the other way around. And that implied that nature’s laws allowed a preferred direction of time. “People didn’t want to believe it,” Cronin said in a 1999 interview. Most physicists do believe it today, but the implications of CP violation for the nature of time and other cosmic questions remain mysterious.</p>



<h4>2. Behaviorism versus the brain</h4>



<p>In the early 20th century, the dogma of behaviorism, initiated by John Watson and championed a little later by B.F. Skinner, ensnared psychologists in a paradigm that literally excised imagination from science. The brain — site of all imagination — is a “black box,” the behaviorists insisted. Rules of human psychology (mostly inferred from experiments with rats and pigeons) could be scientifically established only by observing behavior. It was scientifically meaningless to inquire into the inner workings of the brain that directed such behavior, as those workings were in principle inaccessible to human observation. In other words, activity inside the brain was deemed scientifically irrelevant because it could not be observed. “When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him,” <a href="https://www.bfskinner.org/2017/02/06/about-behaviorism-chapter-1-the-causes-of-behavior-quote-13/">Skinner proclaimed</a>, “investigation is brought to an end.”</p>



<p>Skinner’s behaviorist BS brainwashed a generation or two of followers into thinking the brain was beyond study. But fortunately for neuroscience, some physicists foresaw methods for observing neural activity in the brain without splitting the skull open, exhibiting imagination that the behaviorists lacked. In the 1970s <a href="http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mig/bios/terpogossian.html">Michel Ter-Pogossian</a>, Michael Phelps and colleagues developed PET (positron emission tomography) scanning technology, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/views-living-brain">uses radioactive tracers to monitor brain activity</a>. PET scanning is now complemented by magnetic resonance imaging, based on ideas developed in the 1930s and 1940s by physicists <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bk-2020-1349.ch001">I.I. Rabi, Edward Purcell and Felix Bloch</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>1. Gravitational waves</h4>



<p>Nowadays astrophysicists are all agog about gravitational waves, which can reveal all sorts of secrets about what goes on in the distant universe. All hail Einstein, whose theory of gravity — general relativity — explains the waves’ existence. But Einstein was not the first to propose the idea. In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell devised the math explaining electromagnetic waves, and speculated that gravity might similarly induce waves in a gravitational field. He couldn’t figure out how, though. Later other scientists, including Oliver Heaviside and Henri Poincaré, speculated about gravity waves. So the possibility of their existence certainly had been imagined.</p>



<p>But many physicists doubted that the waves existed, or if they did, could not imagine any way of proving it. Shortly before Einstein completed his general relativity theory, <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-secret-history-of-gravitational-waves">German physicist Gustav Mie declared</a> that “the gravitational radiation emitted … by any oscillating mass particle is so extraordinarily weak that it is unthinkable ever to detect it by any means whatsoever.” Even Einstein had no idea how to detect gravitational waves, although he worked out the math describing them in a 1918 paper. In 1936 he decided that general relativity did not predict gravitational waves at all. But the paper rejecting them was simply wrong.</p>

<p>As it turned out, of course, gravitational waves are real and can be detected. At first they were verified indirectly, by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astrophysical-path-gravity-waves">diminishing distance between mutually orbiting pulsars</a>. And more recently they were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">directly detected by huge experiments relying on lasers</a>. Nobody had been able to imagine detecting gravitational waves a century ago because nobody had imagined the existence of pulsars or lasers.</p>



<p>All these failures show how prejudice can sometimes dull the imagination. But they also show how an imagination failure can inspire the quest for a new success. And that’s why science, so often detoured by dogma, still manages somehow, on long enough time scales, to provide technological wonders and cosmic insights beyond philosophers’ and poets’ wildest imagination.</p>

<p>“Having the opportunity to directly support arXiv and open access, with such a small, dedicated, and mission-driven team, has been an immensely gratifying experience for me,” Lessmeister said. “I will always be grateful for the strong goodwill and ‘rallying cries’ from the arXiv user community in reminding me that the work we’re doing behind the scenes matters, and is bigger than any single person. I know that arXiv has a bright future ahead of itself and I look forward to seeing how it grows.”</p>
<p>With his background in web development and distributed systems and a Masters of Engineering and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Cornell University, Lessmeister has had an incredibly important and far-reaching impact on arXiv’s services. As arXiv submissions increased by 150 percent over the past decade, he brought clarity to complex code, policies, and workflows, and he successfully navigated through periods of technological and organizational change. He also helped set the high standard of collaboration at arXiv and upheld it with great integrity.</p>
<p>Among his many accomplishments, Lessmeister bridged arXiv’s legacy code and next generation systems, developed APIs and other systems that underpin arXiv’s moderation processes, and introduced MathJax, which renders mathematical equations in HTML. He shepherded community-developed tools into arXivLabs, spearheaded a multifaceted effort to improve arXiv’s metadata model, and worked with DataCite to register DOIs for the entire corpus. Most recently, Lessmeister led a team of just three developers charged with maintaining arXiv’s increasingly challenging legacy systems while simultaneously rewriting and migrating all systems to new architecture in the cloud.</p>
<p>“Martin’s dedication, commitment, deep technical expertise, and historical knowledge of the arXiv codebase will be greatly missed,” said Carol Hoover, Scholarly Communications and Licensing Librarian at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and Chair of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board. “He has been a pleasure to collaborate with and an essential part of arXiv’s ongoing success story.”</p>
<p>Lessmeister’s departure coincides with the resignation of Helen Wang, arXiv’s first product manager who was hired in 2021. With a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University and an MBA currently in progress, Wang’s experience in software spanned product management and business development in both nonprofit and corporate settings. In the product manager role, Wang aimed to align organizational objectives and product milestones through data and metrics, as well as support strategy and decision-making with analytics.</p>
<p>“I’ve been so inspired by the collective passion for arXiv’s mission among staff, students, and faculty,” Wang said. “I feel grateful to have been a part of many exciting accomplishments and changes, and look forward to seeing further progress on cloud migration efforts, community-driven features, and membership growth that will sustain arXiv through the next million submissions and beyond.”</p>
<p>“Helen’s commitment to the success of arXiv has been evident since her first day on the job,” said Hoover. “Her depth of experience and ability to learn quickly have been foundational to support arXiv&#8217;s mission as it transitions into the future.”</p>
<p>At a farewell picnic for Lessmeister and Wang, colleagues expressed heartfelt messages of support and thanks that can be summed up as “cheers and tears.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-surgery-oldest-north-america-forehead-brain">North America’s oldest skull surgery dates to at least 3,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A man with a hole in his forehead, who was interred in what’s now northwest Alabama between around 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, represents North America’s oldest known case of skull surgery.</p>



<p>Damage around the man’s oval skull opening indicates that someone scraped out that piece of bone, probably to reduce brain swelling caused by a violent attack or a serious fall, said bioarchaeologist Diana Simpson of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Either scenario could explain fractures and other injuries above the man’s left eye and to his left arm, leg and collarbone.</p>



<p>Bone regrowth on the edges of the skull opening indicates that the man lived for up to one year after surgery, Simpson estimated. She presented her <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.24514">analysis of the man’s remains</a> on March 28 at a virtual session of the annual meeting of the American Association of Biological Anthropologists.</p>





<p>Skull surgery <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-saharan-head-cases">occurred as early as 13,000 years ago</a> in North Africa (<em>SN: 8/17/11</em>). Until now, the oldest evidence of this practice in North America dated to no more than roughly 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>In his prime, the new record holder likely served as a ritual practitioner or shaman. His grave included items like those found in shamans’ graves at nearby North American hunter-gatherer sites dating to between about 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. Ritual objects buried with him included sharpened bone pins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-tattoo-tools-tennessee-native-american">modified deer and turkey bones that may have been tattooing tools</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Investigators excavated the man’s grave and 162 others at the Little Bear Creek Site, a seashell covered burial mound, in the 1940s. Simpson studied the man’s museum-held skeleton and grave items in 2018, shortly before the discoveries were returned to local Native American communities for reburial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-molecular-syringe-cells-microscopy">New images reveal details of two bacteria’s molecular syringes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bacteria carry tiny syringes filled with chemicals that may thin out competitors or incapacitate predators. Now, researchers have gotten up-close views of these syringes, technically known as contractile injection systems, from a type of cyanobacteria and a marine bacterium.</p>



<p>Figuring out how key parts of the molecular syringes work may help scientists devise their own nanomachines. Artificial injection machines could direct antibiotics against troublesome bacteria while leaving friendly microbes untouched.</p>



<p>Genes encoding pieces of the injection machinery are found in many bacterial species. But, “just by looking at the genes, it’s quite hard to predict how these contractile injection systems work,” says Gregor Weiss, a cellular structural biologist at ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>So Weiss and colleagues examined bacterial syringes using cryo-electron microscopy, in which cells are flash frozen to capture <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-spy-secret-inner-life-bacteria">cellular structures as they typically look in nature</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>).</p>



<p>Previously, researchers have found syringes anchored in some bacteria’s outer membranes, where the bacteria can shoot their payload into cells they bump into. Other species’ injectors squirt their contents into the environment.</p>



<p>But in a type of cyanobacteria called <em>Anabaena</em>, the syringes are in an unusual place, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01055-y">nestled in the membrane of the internal structure where the bacteria carry out photosynthesis</a>, Weiss and colleagues report in the March <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. Buried inside the cells, “it’s hard to imagine how [the syringes] could get out and interact with the target organism,” Weiss says.</p>

Weiss <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Microbiology</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Anabaena</em> may use its syringes against itself to trigger programmed cell death when the cyanobacteria come under stress. In the team’s experiments, ultraviolet light or high salt levels in water triggered some syringes to dump their payload. That led to the death of some <em>Anabaena</em> cells in the long chains that the cyanobacteria grow in, forming hollow “ghost cells.”</p>



<p>Ghost cells shed their outer wall and membrane, exposing unfired syringes in the inner membrane to the outside. The ghosts may act like Trojan horses, delivering their deadly payload to predators or competitors, the team hypothesizes. The researchers haven’t yet found which organisms are the probable targets of <em>Anabaena’</em>s syringes.</p>



<p>Inside a type of marine bacteria called <em>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</em>, the story is a bit different. Here, the syringes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01059-2">have a different architecture and float unmoored within the bacterial cell</a>, ETH Zurich’s Charles Ericson and colleagues report in the March <em>Nature Microbiology.</em> The injectors are also found in the liquid in which the bacteria are grown in the laboratory, but how they get out of the cell is a mystery. Perhaps they are released when the bacteria die or get eaten by a predator, Ericson says.</p>



<p>The team also found two proteins loaded inside the <em>Algoriphagus’ </em>syringes, but what those proteins do isn’t known. The researchers tried genetically engineering <em>E. coli</em> to produce one of the proteins, but it kills the bacteria, says study coauthor Jingwei Xu, also at ETH Zurich.</p>

<p>Comparing the structures of syringes from various species, the researchers identified certain structures within the machines that are similar, but slightly different from species to species. Learning how those modifications change the way the injectors work may allow researchers to load different cargoes into the tubes or target the syringes against specific bacteria or other organisms. “Now we have the general blueprint,” Ericson says, “can we re-engineer it?”</p>

                <p>Note: TCC Africa issued the following press release on behalf of all three organizations on Wednesday, March 30, 2022</p>



<p>NAIROBI &mdash; The Association for African Universities (AAU), the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa) today announced that they will collaborate to increase awareness and provide training around Open Science practices and Open Access publishing in Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are eager to collaborate with PLOS and TCC Africa to improve knowledge about Open Science and increase levels of adoption and practice at member institutions,&rdquo; said Professor Oyewole, Secretary General of the Association of African Universities. &ldquo;This partnership will also enable us to identify challenges to Open Science adoption while simultaneously supporting effective implementation. This partnership is another proof of the AAU&rsquo;s commitment to build the capacity of its members so they infuse internationally acceptable research and data management practices into their operations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We already work closely with PLOS, and we are excited about teaming with AAU,&rdquo; said Joy Owango, Executive Director, Training Centre in Communication. &ldquo;All three organizations will play key roles in the communication of, and education in, Open Science practices.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This partnership extends our work with TCC Africa and fits perfectly with our mission to work at a local level, within communities, while listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect local needs and values with regards to Open Science policies and practices,&rdquo; said Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development, PLOS. &ldquo;Our work with AAU and TCC Africa will not just benefit African researchers and institutions, but will also help inform activities on a global scale.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives of this collaboration will primarily be achieved through capacity-building regional workshops carried out across the continent. The launch of the initiative, on April 26, 2022, will be virtual, and is an invitation to the Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors,Directors of Research and Libraries of African Universities to inform them of the intent of this collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initiative will be supported by the participation of representatives from UNESCO, who will talk about the global Open Science recommendation, and the International Science Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All three organizations are heavily invested in an Open future and want to work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem of Africa to promote and increase uptake of Open Access and Open Science more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/joro-spiders-invasive-huge-female-male-size-color">Invasive jorō spiders get huge and flashy — if they’re female</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some thumbnail-sized, brown male spiders in Georgia could be miffed if they paid the least attention to humans and our news obsessions.</p>



<p>Recent stories have made much of “giant” jorō spiders invading North America from eastern Asia, some large enough to span your palm. Lemon yellow bands cross their backs. Bright red bits can add drama, and a softer cheesecake yellow highlights the many joints on long black legs.</p>



<p>The showy giants, however, are just the females of <em>Trichonephila clavata</em>. Males hardly get mentioned except for what they’re not: colorful or big. &nbsp;A he-spider hulk at 8 millimeters barely reaches half the length of small females. Even the species nickname ignores the guys. The word <em>jorō,</em> borrowed from Japanese, translates to such unmasculine terms as “courtesan,” “lady-in-waiting” and even “entangling or binding bride.”</p>





<p>Mismatched sexes are nothing new for spiders. The group shows the most <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ento-011019-025032">extreme size differences between</a> the sexes known among land animals, says evolutionary biologist Matjaž Kuntner of the Evolutionary Zoology Lab in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The most dramatic case Kuntner has heard of comes from <em>Arachnura logio</em> scorpion spiders in East Asia, with females 14.8 times the size of the males.</p>



<p>With such extreme size differences, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/whos-dying-sex">mating conflicts in animals can get violent</a>: females cannibalizing males and so on (<em>SN: 11/13/99</em>). As far as Kuntner knows, however, jorō spiders don’t engage in these “sexually conflicted” extremes. Males being <em>merely</em> half size or thereabouts might explain the relatively peaceful encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to humans, these spiders don’t bother anybody who doesn’t bother them. But what a spectacle they make. “I’ve got dozens and dozens in my yard,” says ecologist Andy Davis at the University of Georgia in Athens. “One big web can be 3 or 4 feet in diameter.” Jorō spiders have <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/763/">lived in northeastern Georgia since at least 2014</a>.</p>

<p>These new neighbors inspired Davis and undergraduate Benjamin Frick to see if the newcomers withstand chills better than an earlier invader, <em>Trichonephila clavipes, </em>their more tropical relative also known as the golden silk orb-weaver. (The jorō also can spin yellow-tinged silk.) The earlier arrival’s flashy females and drab males haven’t left the comfy Southeast they invaded at least 160 years ago.</p>



<p>Figuring out the jorō’s hardiness involves taking the spider’s pulse. But how do you do that with an arthropod with a hard exoskeleton? A spider’s heart isn’t a mammallike lump circulating blood through a closed system. The jorō sluices its bloodlike fluid through a long tube open at both ends. “Think of a garden hose,” says Davis. He has measured heart rates of monarch caterpillars, and he found a spot on a spider’s back where a keen-eyed observer can count throbs.</p>



<p>Female jorō spiders packed in ice to simulate chill stress kept their heart rates some 77 percent higher than the stay-put <em>T. clavipes</em>, tests showed. Checking jorō oxygen use showed females have about twice the metabolic rate. And about two minutes of freezing temperatures showed better female survival (74 percent versus 50 percent). Lab tests used only the conveniently big jorō females, though male ability to function in random cold snaps could matter too.</p>



<p>Plus jorō sightings in the Southeast so far suggest the newer arrival needs less time than its relative to make the next generation, an advantage for farther to the north. The adults don’t need to survive deep winter in any case. Mom and dad die off, in November in Georgia, and leave their hundreds of eggs packed in silk to weather the cold and storms.</p>



<p>Reports on the citizen-observer <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=1&amp;subview=map&amp;taxon_id=904334">iNaturalist</a> &nbsp;site suggest that in Georgia, jorō spiders <a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phen.12385">already cover some 40,000 square kilometers</a>, Davis and Frick report February 17 in <em>Physiological Entomology. </em>Sightings now stretch into Tennessee and the Carolinas. But how far the big moms and tiny dads will go and when, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/30/embracing-discomfort-rather-than-avoiding-it-can-help-us-work-towards-our-personal-goals/">Embracing discomfort, rather than avoiding it, can help us work towards our personal goals</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In order to develop new skills or grow as a person, you often have to get out of your comfort zone. Say you want to become a better public speaker: you will have to get up and practice speaking in front of others, and that will likely feel awkward and uncomfortable at first.</p>



<p>This can create barriers to personal growth, because those feelings of discomfort that you experience will come well before you will notice any improvement in your skills. As a result, you might feel that the negative emotional experience is not worth it, and give up on your goal.</p>



<p>But what if we reframe our attitude towards discomfort, seeing it as a sign of progress and something to strive for rather than avoid? A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211044685">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>suggests that this way of thinking can motivate people to work towards their goals.</p>



<span id="more-45885"></span>



<p>In the first study, Kaitlin Woolley from Cornell University and Ayelet Fishbach from the University of Chicago recruited 557 adults enrolled in beginner-level improvisation workshops. Participants took part in an improv exercise called “Give Focus”. This involves one member of the group moving around the room however they wish while the others are frozen in place; at some point the free-moving improviser chooses to pass the “focus” on to another member of the group, who then takes over.</p>



<p>Before the exercise began, half of the participants were told that the goal was “to feel awkward and uncomfortable”, and that these feelings were a sign that the exercise was working. Control participants were simply given the normal instructions for the exercise, without any mention of discomfort. The researchers took video recordings of the improvisations, which were later rated for both persistence (how long participants took the spotlight before passing it on to another member of the group) and risk-taking (how much they pushed the boundaries or went out a limb during their improvisation).</p>



<p>The team found that participants who had been told to pursue feelings of awkwardness spent more time improvising and showed more risk-taking, which the authors interpret as showing that they were more motivated during the task. These participants also were more likely to believe that they had achieved their personal goals during the exercise.</p>



<p>Further online experiments suggested that seeking out feelings of discomfort can motivate people in a range of other situations too. In one study, participants took part in a writing exercise that they were told could help them work though an important emotional issue. Some were told that the goal of the exercise was to feel awkward and uncomfortable, and that these feelings were a sign that the task was working. After finishing the task, these participants were more likely to believe that the exercise had helped them to grow emotionally and develop coping skills, and were more motivated to repeat it in the future, compared to a control group.  </p>



<p>In other studies, participants were similarly encouraged to feel upset or uncomfortable while reading about Covid-19, gun violence, or the views of an opposing political party. These participants were more motivated to learn about these topics compared to control participants who did not seek out discomfort.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that we should seek out the feelings of awkwardness or discomfort that are often associated with personal growth, and interpret them as signs of progress towards our goals. This can motivate us when faced with what we might otherwise simply see as negative emotional experiences.</p>



<p>It’s nice to see a paper that doesn’t just rely on online or lab-based studies, but includes a test of the intervention in the real world — in this case, in actual improvisation workshops. But it would be interesting to know whether embracing discomfort has long-lasting effects on motivation too, beyond a single point in time. Is someone actually more likely to persist with their goal of being a better public speaker if they embrace feelings of discomfort? Only longer-term studies will be able to tell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bat-africa-lost-found-echolocation-hills-horseshoe">How scientists found an African bat lost to science for 40 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Julius Nziza still remembers the moment vividly. Just before dawn on a chilly January morning in 2019, he and his team gently extracted a tiny brown bat from a net purposely strung to catch the nocturnal fliers. A moment later, the researchers’ whoops and hollers pierced the heavy mist blanketing Rwanda’s Nyungwe National Park. The team had just laid eyes on a Hill’s horseshoe bat (<em>Rhinolophus hilli</em>), which scientists hadn’t seen for nearly four decades.</p>



<p>Nziza, a wildlife veterinarian at Gorilla Doctors in Musanze, Rwanda, and a self-described “bat champion,” had been looking for the critically endangered <em>R. hilli</em> since 2013. For several years, Nziza and Paul Webala from Maasai Mara University in Narok, Kenya, with the help of Nyungwe park rangers, surveyed the forest for spots where the bats might frequent. They didn’t find <em>R. hilli, </em>but it helped them narrow where to keep looking.</p>



<p>In 2019, the team decided to concentrate on roughly four square kilometers in a high-elevation region of the forest where <em>R. hilli </em>had last been spotted in 1981. Accompanied by an international team of researchers, Nziza and Webala set out for a 10-day expedition in search of the elusive bat. It wasn’t rainy season yet, but the weather was already starting to turn. “It was very, very, very cold,” Nziza recalls.</p>





<p>Every night, from sunset until close to midnight, the researchers stretched nets across trails, where bats are most likely to fly, and kept watch. Then, after a few hours of rest, they woke early to check the traps again. It was cold enough that the bats could die if stuck too long.</p>



<p>At 4 a.m. on the fourth day, the researchers caught a bat with the distinctive horseshoe-shaped nose of all horseshoe bat species. But it looked slightly different from others they had captured. This one had darker fur and a pointed tip on its nose.</p>



<p>Everyone began shouting: “This is it!”</p>

<p>The researchers felt “almost 99 percent sure” they had found the lost bat. “We had a couple beers in the evening,” Nziza says. “It was worth celebration.” To be 100 percent sure, though, the team needed to compare its specimen to past ones of <em>R. hilli</em>. Fortunately, there were two in museums in Europe.</p>



<p>That’s because this isn’t the first time that <em>R. hilli</em> was lost, then found, to science. Victor van Cakenberghe, a retired taxonomist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, rediscovered<em> R. hilli </em>17 years after it was first seen in 1964. He says he still remembers finding the bat tangled in a mist net strung across a river. He kept the specimen and brought it back to a Belgian museum.</p>



<p>Nearly 40 years later, Nziza and colleagues compared the measurements of their bat,&nbsp;which was released into the wild, to the preserved bat. At long last, it can be confidently said that <a href="https://preprints.arphahub.com/article/83547/"><em>R. hilli </em>was rediscovered again</a>, researchers report March 11 in a preprint submitted to <em>Biodiversity Data Journal</em>.</p>



<p>And, for the first time ever, the scientists recorded <em>R. hilli</em>’s echolocation call. Now, the rangers can use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-people-spillover-transmission-coronavirus-covid-19">acoustic detectors</a> to keep an eye — or rather, an ear —&nbsp;on the bat (<em>SN: 10/23/20</em>). In nine months, they’ve already captured <em>R. hilli</em> calls from eight different locations in the same small area.</p>

<p>The team <a href="https://www.gbif.org/dataset/e9bf7d9e-8b31-4a02-8203-f7153b5d64c6">published its data to the open-access Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a> in hopes of speeding up conservation efforts for the bat. Africa is home to over 20 percent of the world’s bats, but with a longstanding research focus on bats in Europe and the Americas, little is known about African bat species.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a whole new thing,” Nziza says. “That&#8217;s why everybody&#8217;s excited.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-launches-new-feature-to-promote-data-sharing-and-access/">PLOS launches new feature to promote data sharing and access</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release the week of March 28, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a> today announced that it is testing a new experimental open science feature intended to promote data sharing and reuse across the PLOS journal portfolio. A subset of PLOS articles that link to shared research data in a repository will now display a prominent visual cue designed to help researchers find accessible data. Sharing research data that support published articles is considered best practice as it promotes data discovery and reuse, and aligns with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles.</p>



<p><a>&ldquo;We want to increase the adoption of open science and make the practice of open science more beneficial to researchers, who can encounter problems finding accessible data. To support these goals, and thanks to support from the </a><a href="https://wellcome.org/">Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with solutions designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data that also save researchers time,&rdquo; said Iain<strong> </strong>Hrynaszkiewicz,Director of Open Research Solutions, PLOS.</p>



<p>Today&rsquo;s launch is an &lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. The feature will appear on more than 3,000 PLOS articles, beginning this week. It will also appear on newly published articles that qualify for the feature during the experiment, which is expected to run until the end of 2022. PLOS articles that link to datasets in <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a> or <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> will display the feature initially. The feature will be extended to more repositories if the experiment is successful in increasing use of data associated with publications.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As an early adopter of Figshare, PLOS continues to innovate in open research publishing by introducing this new feature that will offer researchers who share and need to reuse FAIR data more benefits,&rdquo; said Mark Hahnel, CEO, Figshare.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Offering researchers incentives to share research data, such as badges or visual cues on their papers, has been shown to increase adoption of open science in other contexts. We welcome PLOS&rsquo; experiment with this feature and are looking forward to seeing the results,&rdquo; said David Mellor, Director of Policy, Center for Open Science.</p>



<p>Other publishers have experimented with prominent visual links to research data, and PLOS&rsquo; feature has similarities with the Center for Open Science&rsquo;s Badges. However, this experiment is intended to encourage more researchers to share data according to best practices as well as encourage wider access and use of data. Articles link directly to the data in the repository and offer a visual cue (or &ldquo;reward&rdquo;) on the published article. PLOS believes that making linked research data more visible on article pages will increase its use, helping readers spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets.</p>



<p>In another experiment launched last October, <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> introduced an optional step in the manuscript submission process that allows seamless deposition of data to Dryad.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In addition to seeing Dryad users able to benefit from the Accessible Data feature experiment, we&rsquo;re also delighted to be part of <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> data deposition pilot, offering researchers in the journal&rsquo;s community tools and incentives to make their data findable and accessible,&rdquo; said Jennifer Gibson, Executive Director, Dryad.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324006312">Vagina Obscura</a><br><em>Rachel E. Gross<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>More than 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates, the Greek physician often considered the father of modern medicine, identified what came to be known as the clitoris, a “little pillar” of erectile tissue near the vagina’s entrance. Aristotle then noticed that the seemingly small structure was related to sexual pleasure.</p>



<p>Yet it wasn’t until 2005 that urologist Helen O’Connell uncovered that the “little pillar” was just the tip of the iceberg. The internal parts of the organ reach around the vagina and go into the pelvis, extending a network of nerves deeper than anatomists ever knew.</p>





<p>It took millennia to uncover the clitoris’s true extent because sexism has long stymied the study of female biology, science journalist Rachel E. Gross argues in her new book, <em>Vagina Obscura</em>. Esteemed men of science, from Charles Darwin to Sigmund Freud, viewed men as superior to women. To be male was to be the ideal standard. To be female was to be a stunted version of a human. The vagina, the ancient Greeks concluded, was merely a penis turned inside out, the ovaries simply interior testicles.</p>



<p>Because men mostly considered women’s bodies for their reproductive capabilities and interactions with penises, only recently have researchers begun to truly understand the full scope of female organs and tissues, Gross shows. That includes the basic biology of what “healthy” looks like in these parts of the body and their effects on the body as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Vagina Obscura</em> itself was born out of Gross’ frustration at not understanding her own body in the wake of a vaginal infection. After antibiotics and antifungal treatments failed due to a misdiagnosis, her gynecologist prescribed another treatment. As Gross paraphrases, the doctor told her to “shove rat poison up my vagina.” The infection, it turned out, was bacterial vaginosis, a hard-to-treat, sometimes itchy and painful condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that normally reside in the vagina. (The rat poison was boric acid, which is also an antiseptic. “It’s basically rat poison,” the doctor said. “You’re going to see that on the internet, so I might as well tell you now.”)</p>





<p>The book’s exploration of female anatomy begins from the outside in, first traversing the clitoris’s nerve-filled external nub to the vagina, ovaries and uterus. The last chapter focuses on gender affirmation surgery, detailing how physicians have transformed the field for transgender people. (Gross is up-front that words such as <em>women</em> and <em>men</em> create an artificial binary, with seemingly more objective terms like “male” and “female” not performing much better in encompassing humankind’s diversity, including intersex and transgender people.)</p>



<p>Throughout this tour, Gross doesn’t shy away from confronting the sexism and prejudices behind controversial ideas about female biology, such as vaginal orgasms (versus coming from the clitoris) and the existence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinpointing-g-spot-or-not">the G-spot</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/12</em>). Both “near-mystical” concepts stem from the male perspective that sexual pleasure should be straightforward for women, if only men could hit the right spot. Nor are the more appalling offenses swept under the rug, including racism, eugenics and female genital cutting. Footnotes throughout the book detail Gross’ efforts to navigate controversial views and stigmatizing or culturally charged terminology.</p>



<p>To lift readers’ spirits, she finds the right spots to deliver a dose of wry humor or a pun. She also shares stories of often forgotten researchers, such as lab technician <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/artificial-fertilization">Miriam Menkin</a>, who showed in 1944 that in vitro fertilization is possible (<em>SN: 8/12/44</em>). Yet Menkin’s role in describing the first instance of a human egg being fertilized in a lab dish has largely been erased from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">IVF’s history</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>). There’s also plenty of opportunity to marvel at the power of the female body. Despite the long-held notion that a person is born with all the eggs they’ll ever have, for example, researchers are now discovering the ovary’s regenerative properties.</p>



<p>Studying female bodies more closely could ultimately improve quality of life. Chasing cells capable of producing more eggs might bring about discoveries that could restore the menstrual cycle in cancer patients rendered infertile by chemotherapy or make menopause less miserable. Patients with endometriosis, a painful disorder in which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, are often dismissed and their symptoms downplayed. Some doctors even recommend getting pregnant to avoid the pain. But people shouldn’t have to suffer just because they aren’t pregnant. Researchers just haven’t asked the right questions yet about the uterus or endometriosis, Gross argues. </p>



<p><em>Vagina Obscura</em> reinforces that female bodies are more than “walking wombs” or “baby machines.” Understanding these organs and tissues is important for keeping the people who have them healthy. It will take a lot of vagina studies to overcome centuries of neglect, Gross writes. But the book provides a glimpse into what is possible when researchers (finally) pay attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wally-broecker-abrupt-ocean-conveyor-belt">Wally Broecker divined how the climate could suddenly shift</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the mid-1980s, at a meeting in Switzerland, when Wally Broecker’s ears perked up. Scientist Hans Oeschger was describing an ice core drilled at a military radar station in southern Greenland. Layer by layer, the 2-kilometer-long core revealed what the climate there was like thousands of years ago. Climate shifts, inferred from the amounts of carbon dioxide and of a form of oxygen in the core, played out surprisingly quickly — within just a few decades. It seemed almost too fast to be true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Broecker returned home, to Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and began wondering what could cause such dramatic shifts. Some of Oeschger’s data turned out to be incorrect, but the seed they planted in Broecker’s mind flowered —&nbsp;and ultimately changed the way scientists think about past and future climate.</p>



<p>A geochemist who studied the oceans, Broecker proposed that the shutdown of a major ocean circulation pattern, which he named the great ocean conveyor, could cause the North Atlantic climate to change abruptly. In the past, he argued, melting ice sheets released huge pulses of water into the North Atlantic, turning the water fresher and halting circulation patterns that rely on salty water. The result: a sudden atmospheric cooling that plunged the region, including Greenland, into a big chill. (In the 2004 movie <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>, an overly dramatized oceanic shutdown coats the Statue of Liberty in ice.)</p>

<p>It was a leap of insight unprecedented for the time, when most researchers had yet to accept that climate could shift abruptly, much less ponder what might cause such shifts.</p>



<p>Broecker not only explained the changes seen in the Greenland ice core, he also went on to found a new field. He prodded, cajoled and brought together other scientists to study the entire climate system and how it could shift on a dime. “He was a really big thinker,” says Dorothy Peteet, a paleoclimatologist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City who worked with Broecker for decades. “It was just his genuine curiosity about how the world worked.”</p>



<p>Broecker was born in 1931 into a fundamentalist family who believed the Earth was 6,000 years old, so he was not an obvious candidate to become a pathbreaking geoscientist. Because of his dyslexia, he relied on conversations and visual aids to soak up information. Throughout his life, he did not use computers, a linchpin of modern science, yet became an expert in radiocarbon dating. And, contrary to the siloing common in the sciences, he worked expansively to understand the oceans, the atmosphere, the land, and thus the entire Earth system.</p>



<p>By the 1970s, scientists knew that humans were pouring excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, through burning fossil fuels and cutting down carbon-storing forests, and that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">those changes were tinkering with Earth’s natural thermostat</a>. Scientists knew that climate had changed in the past; geologic evidence over billions of years revealed hot or dry, cold or wet periods. But many scientists focused on long-term climate changes, paced by shifts in the way Earth rotates on its axis and circles the sun — both of which change the amount of sunlight the planet receives.<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.194.4270.1121"> A highly influential 1976 paper</a> referred to these orbital shifts as the “pacemaker of the ice ages.”</p>



<p>Ice cores from Antarctica <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cores-clues-past-climates">and Greenland changed the game</a>. In 1969, Willi Dansgaard of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.166.3903.377">reported results</a> from a Greenland ice core covering the last 100,000 years. They found large, rapid fluctuations in oxygen-18 that suggested wild temperature swings. Climate could oscillate quickly, it seemed — but it took another Greenland ice core and more than a decade before Broecker had the idea that the shutdown of the great ocean conveyor system could be to blame.</p>

<p>Broecker proposed that such a shutdown was responsible for a known cold snap that started around 12,900 years ago. As the Earth began to emerge from its orbitally influenced ice age, water melted off the northern ice sheets and washed into the North Atlantic. Ocean circulation halted, plunging Europe into a sudden chill, he said. The period, which lasted just over a millennium, is known as the Younger Dryas after an Arctic flower that thrived during the cold snap. It was the last hurrah of the last ice age.</p>



<p>Evidence that an ocean conveyor shutdown could cause dramatic climate shifts soon piled up in Broecker’s favor. For instance, Peteet found evidence of rapid Younger Dryas cooling in bogs near New York City — thus establishing that the cooling was not just a European phenomenon but also extended to the other side of the Atlantic. Changes were real, widespread and fast.</p>



<p>By the late 1980s and early ’90s, there was enough evidence supporting abrupt climate change that two major projects — one European, one American — began to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tales-ice-time">drill a pair of fresh cores</a> into the Greenland ice sheet. Richard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State, remembers working through the layers and documenting small climatic changes over thousands of years. “Then we hit the end of the Younger Dryas and it was like falling off a cliff,” he says. It was “a huge change after many small changes,” he says. “Breathtaking.”</p>





<p>The new Greenland cores cemented scientific recognition of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-core-shows-speedy-climate-change">abrupt climate change</a>. Though the shutdown of the ocean conveyor could not explain all abrupt climate changes that had ever occurred, it showed how a single physical mechanism could trigger major planet-wide disruptions. It also opened discussions about how rapidly climate might change in the future.</p>



<p>Broecker, who died in 2019, spent his last decades exploring abrupt shifts that are already happening. He worked, for example, with billionaire Gary Comer, who during a yacht trip in 2001 was shocked by the shrinking of Arctic sea ice, to brainstorm new directions for climate research and climate solutions.</p>



<p>Broecker knew more than almost anyone about what might be coming. He often described Earth’s climate system as an angry beast that humans are poking with sticks. And <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.189.4201.460">one of his most famous papers</a> was titled “Climatic change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?”</p>



<p>It was published in 1975.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-cream-crystals-grainy-nanocrystals-cellulose">Grainy ice cream is unpleasant. Plant-based nanocrystals might help</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can never have too much ice cream, but you can have too much ice in your ice cream. Adding plant-based nanocrystals to the frozen treat could help solve that problem, researchers reported March 20 at the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/acs-meetings.html">American Chemical Society spring meeting</a> in San Diego.</p>



<p>Ice cream contains tiny ice crystals that grow bigger when natural temperature fluctuations in the freezer cause them to melt and recrystallize. Stabilizers in ice cream — typically guar gum or locust bean gum — help inhibit crystal growth, but don’t completely stop it. And once ice crystals hit 50 micrometers in diameter, ice cream takes on an unpleasant, coarse, grainy texture.</p>



<p>Cellulose nanocrystals, or CNCs, which are derived from wood pulp, have properties similar to the gums, says Tao Wu, a food scientist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. They also share similarities with antifreeze proteins, produced by some animals to help them survive subzero temperatures. Antifreeze proteins work by binding to the surface of ice crystals, inhibiting growth more effectively than gums — but they are also extremely expensive. CNCs <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X21004276">might work similarly</a> to antifreeze proteins but at a fraction of the cost, Wu and his colleagues thought.</p>



<p>An experiment with a sucrose solution — a simplified ice cream proxy — and CNCs showed that after 24 hours, the ice crystals <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c01201">completely stopped growing</a>. A week later, the ice crystals remained at 25 micrometers, well beneath the threshold of ice crystal crunchiness. In a similar experiment with guar gum, ice crystals grew to 50 micrometers in just three days.</p>

<p>“That by itself suggests that nanocrystals are a lot more potent than the gums,” says Richard Hartel, a food engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the research. If CNCs do function the same way as antifreeze proteins, they’re a promising alternative to current stabilizers, he says. But that still needs to be proven.</p>



<p>Until that happens, you continue to have a good excuse to eat your ice cream quickly: You wouldn’t want large ice crystals to form, after all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">Spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions, PLOS</p>



<p><em>We&rsquo;re testing a new experimental open science feature intended to promote data sharing and reuse across the PLOS journal portfolio. A subset of PLOS articles that link to shared research data in a repository will display a prominent visual cue designed to help researchers find accessible data, and encourage best practice in data sharing.</em></p>



<h2>Exploring incentives and increasing data accessibility</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">project funded by the Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with solutions designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data. and the second of these solutions launches this week. Both solutions are intended to promote the use of data repositories for data sharing and the linking of data to publications. Sharing research data that support published articles is considered best practice as it promotes data discovery and reuse, and aligns with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles</a>.</p>



<p>The first solution we introduced was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010021"><em>PLOS Pathogens</em>&rsquo; integration with the Dryad repository</a>, which launched as a pilot in October 2021, and aims to increase repository use by introducing a small (optional) step in the manuscript submission process that allows seamless deposition of data to Dryad.</p>



<p>This second, experimental, solution is an &lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. The feature will appear on more than 3,000 PLOS articles, beginning this week. It will also appear on newly published articles that qualify for the feature during the course of the experiment, which is expected to run until the end of 2022.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="284" height="462" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20187" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png 284w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></figure></div>



<p>We&rsquo;re <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456">not</a> <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking">the</a> <a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/694">first</a> publisher to experiment with prominent visual links to research data, and some readers will see similarities between this feature and <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges">Center for Open Science&rsquo;s Badges</a>. Since the introduction of our data availability policy in 2014, every published PLOS research article includes a Data Availability Statement (DAS) and a growing proportion of these include links to data repositories in the DAS. This solution leverages the outcomes of our long-standing data availability policy and aims to increase the visibility and reuse of those publications that share data in repositories, while encouraging more researchers to take this approach.</p>



<p>An important difference with this experiment is the questions we&rsquo;re asking. Previous projects have explored the role of badges in encouraging more researchers to share data according to best practises, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5803640/">some encouraging results</a>. But our solution is intended to promote both data sharing <em>and</em> access &ndash; by linking directly to the data in the repository, and offering a visual cue (or &ldquo;reward&rdquo;) on the published article. We hypothesise that making linked research data more visible on article pages will increase its use, helping readers spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets.</p>



<p>Another difference in our approach is automation. Articles that qualify for the feature will display the feature automatically based on simple rules, without extra human intervention by authors or editors. This offers recognition to authors who have embedded good research data practice in their publishing workflow, without placing more burden on authors, editors or peer reviewers.</p>



<p>Our experimentation with these solutions is informed by <a href="https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2021-031/">research involving PLOS authors</a> that suggest many researchers have challenges in accessing research data that they can reuse &mdash; which we assume could be addressed in part by wider use of repositories. The feature has been subject to several rounds of testing with researchers and design experts to optimise the visual design and language of the text.</p>



<h2>Scope of the experiment</h2>



<p>The Accessible Data feature is limited in its scope in this experimental phase*. The feature will appear on PLOS articles that:</p>



<ul><li>Have been published since 2016, and</li><li>Include a single link to data in a repository in their Data Availability Statement, and</li><li>The link directs to a unique record in Dryad, Figshare, or Open Science Framework (OSF)</li></ul>



<p>See an example&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107">here</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve limited the scope for a few reasons. First, by keeping the scope no larger than necessary to test our hypotheses, we can experiment faster and at lower cost. Second, we need to be able to measure if we are successful in achieving the goal of increasing data access. Dryad, Figshare and OSF provide readily accessible usage data about deposited datasets, which will help us monitor any correlations between reader engagement with the links and usage of the datasets (We&rsquo;ve chosen usage/ engagement with the datasets as a more rapidly available proxy &ndash; and a prerequisite &ndash; for data reuse). Third, these repositories are relatively well used by PLOS authors, providing a sufficient cohort of papers with which to experiment.</p>



<p>There are numerous other repositories used by PLOS authors, which are equally as valuable to the researchers, communities, and institutions they support. If the solution is successful in achieving a measurable increase in data use, we will extend it in the future to handle more complexity &ndash;&nbsp; more data repositories, unique identifier types, and more complex Data Availability Statements. There are also other potential future directions to explore, such as the integration of data linking with data citations to increase credit for data sharing; with data discovery tools; and with <a href="http://www.scholix.org/">open infrastructure for sharing and reusing data-article link information</a>.</p>



<h2>Looking for the &lsquo;what&rsquo; and the &lsquo;why&rsquo;</h2>



<p>As well as monitoring what usage of the feature and datasets are observed, we&rsquo;re conducting research to help us understand why the solution is effective &ndash; or not. Readers of PLOS articles who use the feature will be invited to take part in a survey, and a subset invited to interviews. Authors submitting manuscripts after the launch of the feature will be surveyed to find out if the feature had any impact on how they shared data. This research will complement research we&rsquo;re also conducting with users of <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#dryad">the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> Dryad integration</a>. As experimenters, we&rsquo;re open to challenging our ideas and designs when we analyse the results, which will, naturally, be <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">shared with the community</a> in the future.</p>

                <p>Human language, in its many current forms, may owe an evolutionary debt to our distant ape ancestors who sounded off in groups of scattered individuals.</p>

This finding suggests that social forces began engineering an expanding inventory of communication sounds among ancient ancestors of apes and humans, laying a foundation for the evolution of language, say evolutionary psychologist Adriano Lameira, of the University of Warwick in England, and his colleagues.</p>



<p>Lameira’s group recorded predator-warning calls known as “kiss-squeaks” — which typically involve drawing in breath through pursed lips — of 76 orangutans from six populations living on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/borneo-hunting-emerges-key-threat-endangered-orangutans">they face survival threats</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/18</em>). The team tracked the animals and estimated their population densities from 2005 through 2010, with at least five consecutive months of observations and recordings in each population. Analyses of recordings then revealed how much individuals’ kiss-squeaks changed or remained the same over time.</p>





<p>Orangutans in high-density populations, which up the odds of frequent social encounters, concoct many variations of kiss-squeaks, the researchers report. Novel reworkings of kiss-squeaks usually get modified further by other orangutans or drop out of use in crowded settings, they say.</p>



<p>In spread-out populations that reduce social mingling, these apes produce relatively few kiss-squeak variants, Lameira’s group finds. But occasional kiss-squeak tweaks tend to catch on in their original form in dispersed groups, leading to larger call repertoires than in high-density populations.</p>



<p>Low-density orangutan groups — featuring small clusters of animals that occasionally cross paths — might mirror the social settings of human ancestors. Ancient apes and hominids also lived in dispersed groups that could have bred a growing number of ways to communicate vocally, the researchers suspect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/28/when-the-school-day-starts-later-teens-get-better-sleep-and-feel-more-motivated/">When the school day starts later, teens get better sleep and feel more motivated</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><em>By guest blogger</em></em> <a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Getting out of bed is the first major hurdle of most teens’ weekdays. Often assumed to be the product of laziness or moodiness, this difficulty rising in the morning is actually due to adolescent sleep patterns. During teenage years, circadian rhythms are relatively delayed, causing teenagers to both go to sleep and wake up later in the day.</p>



<p>Even so, schools in the UK still demand that teens attend lessons from 9am or earlier, while high schoolers in Germany or the USA may start as early as 7:30am. This holds students to early rise times that are more suited to those in other age groups.</p>



<p>In an attempt to compensate for lost sleep during the week, teens often oversleep on weekends and reduce their sleep overall. As poor sleep routines are associated with cardiovascular issues, mood disorders, substance abuse and more, it’s easy to see why improving sleep in teens is an appealing target.</p>



<p>But what if school starting times worked with, rather than against, teenage sleep requirements? Research studies from years gone by indicate that such a change could be beneficial, but many lacked appropriate methods to measure potential effects of sleep interventions over longer periods of time.</p>



<p>This is precisely the gap that Anna Biller and colleagues in Germany endeavoured to fill with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06209-4">recent study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<span id="more-45864"></span>



<p>The team recruited students at a secondary school in Germany. This particular school has employed a &#8220;flexible system&#8221; since 2016, which allows students in grades 10 to 12 to postpone the start of their school day from 8AM to 8.50AM (or 10.15AM, on a day every two weeks when schedules allow it) as they please. Any morning study time lost to sleeping is regained by adding time after their last class of the day, or by filling gap periods already present in their schedule.</p>



<p>Data were collected in two waves, for six weeks immediately after the implementation of the flexible system and then again one year later. The team also took baseline measurements just before the system was introduced. 33 students participated in both waves, forming a longitudinal cohort.</p>



<p>In both waves, students completed a sleep diary noting when they fell asleep and woke up, their subjective sleep quality, and whether they had started school at 8AM or later. At the end of wave two, participating students also answered questions about their experiences and feelings surrounding the late start scheme.</p>



<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the uptake of late starts was quite low overall. By the end of the study, participants were only making use of a late start an average of just over one day per week. From student to student, uptake varied hugely — some would never use late starts, while others would use them every day.</p>



<p>When students did use later starts, however, they reported sleeping longer and better, getting closer to the optimal level of 8 hours of sleep. These benefits were near-universal, with 93% of students in the longitudinal cohort reporting longer sleep on late start days in both the first and second wave. On these days, participants also reported improved sleep quality, and were more likely to report waking naturally before their alarm.</p>



<p>A clear gender difference also emerged. In the first year, both boys and girls stuck to their usual bedtimes while using the flexible start. But a year later, boys were more likely to take the opportunity to postpone their sleep onset, resulting in sleep gains falling from 1.3 hours to just 30 minutes. The authors believe that this split in behaviour may have been a factor in previous research’s mixed findings.</p>



<p>However, the flexible system didn’t produce a significant improvement in students’ <em>overall</em> sleep across the entire week. The team believe that this is due to the low uptake of the late start scheme. Though on paper a later start might sound appealing, students listed many reasons that they preferred to start earlier, such as difficulty getting to school later.</p>



<p>Another paper from the same study also showed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06804-5">no improvement in grades for students who favoured waking later</a> — though the team believe that grades are arguably not an ideal proxy through which to see improvements. Despite this, the current paper did provide clear evidence of other kinds of benefits: not only did the students enjoy getting to school later on late-start days, they also felt more motivated and able to concentrate, and reported greater sense of wellbeing.</p>



<p>This study was conducted at the most academic type of German secondary school, equivalent to a grammar school, which limits the generalisability of the findings. It’s possible, perhaps even likely, that students from other backgrounds or countries will experience different costs and benefits when taking advantage of late starts.</p>



<p>As appealing as later school starts may sound, their practicality and effects on students within the UK system requires further investigation. Apologies to younger readers!</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06209-4">Sleep improvements on days with later school starts persist after 1 year in a flexible start system</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/virus-caterpillars-zombies-climb-death-genes-vision-sunlight">How a virus turns caterpillars into zombies doomed to climb to their deaths</a></h4>

              
                <p>Higher and higher still, the cotton bollworm moth caterpillar climbs, its tiny body ceaselessly scaling leaf after leaf. Reaching the top of a plant, it will die, facilitating the spread of the virus that steered the insect there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One virus behind this deadly ascent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16425">manipulates genes associated with caterpillars’ vision</a>. As a result, the insects are more attracted to sunlight than usual, researchers report online March 8 in <em>Molecular Ecology</em>.</p>



<p>The virus involved in this caterpillar takeover is a type of baculovirus. These viruses may have been evolving with their insect hosts for 200 million to 300 million years, says Xiaoxia Liu, an entomologist at China Agricultural University in Beijing. Baculoviruses can infect more than 800 insect species, mostly the caterpillars of moths and butterflies. Once infected, the hosts exhibit “tree-top disease,” compelled to climb before dying and leaving their elevated, infected cadavers for scavengers to feast upon.</p>





<p>The clever trick of these viruses has been known for more than a century, Liu says. But how they turn caterpillars into zombies doomed to ascend to their own deaths wasn’t understood.</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that infected caterpillars exhibit greater “phototaxis,” meaning they are more attracted to light than uninfected insects. Liu and her team confirmed this effect in the laboratory using cotton bollworm moth caterpillars (<em>Helicoverpa armigera</em>) infected with a baculovirus called HearNPV.</p>



<p>The researchers compared infected and uninfected caterpillars’ positions in glass tubes surrounding a climbing mesh under an LED light. Uninfected caterpillars would wander up and down the mesh, but would return to the bottom before pupating. That behavior makes sense because in the wild, this species develops into adults underground. But infected hosts would end up dead at the top of the mesh. The higher the source of light, the higher infected hosts climbed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team moved to the horizontal plane to confirm that the hosts were responding to light rather than gravity, placing caterpillars in a hexagonal box with one of the side panels illuminated. By the second day after infection, host caterpillars crawled to the light about four times as often as the uninfected.</p>



<p>When the researchers surgically removed infected caterpillars’ eyes and put the insects in the box, the blinded insects were attracted to the light a quarter as often as unaltered infected hosts. That suggested that the virus was using a caterpillar’s vision against itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then compared how active certain genes were in various caterpillar body parts in infected and uninfected larvae. Detected mostly in the eyes, two genes for opsins, the light-sensitive proteins that are fundamental for vision, were more active after an infection with the virus, and so was another gene associated with vision called <em>TRPL</em>. It encodes for a channel in cell membranes involved in the conversion of light into electrical signals.</p>



<p>When the team used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to shut off the opsin genes and <em>TRPL</em> in infected caterpillars, the number of hosts attracted to the light in the box was cut roughly in half. Their height at death on the mesh was also reduced.</p>



<p>Baculoviruses appear capable of commandeering the genetic architecture of caterpillar vision, exploiting an ancient importance of light for insects, Liu says.</p>



<p>Light can cue crucial biological processes in insects, from directing their developmental timing, to setting their migration routes.</p>



<p>These viruses were already known to be master manipulators in other ways, tweaking their hosts’ sense of smell, molting patterns and the programmed death of cells, says Lorena Passarelli, a virologist at Kansas State University in Manhattan, who was not involved with the study. The new research shows that the viruses manipulate “yet another physiological host process: visual perception.”</p>



<p>There’s still a lot to learn about this visual hijacking, Passarelli says. It’s unknown, for instance, which of the virus’s genes are responsible for turning caterpillars into sunlight-chasing zombies in the first place.</p>

                "The EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market contains two spectacularly bad ideas. One is the upload filter of Article 17, which will wreak havoc not just on creativity in the EU, but also on freedom of speech there, as algorithms block perfectly legal material. The other concerns the “snippet tax” of Article 15, more formally known as ancillary copyright..

Just as the impetus for the upload filter came from the music and film industries, so the lobbying for Article 15 came from newspaper publishers. The logic behind their demand, such as it was, seemed to be that Google was making money from ads on its pages that had some links to newspaper sites. That ignored two inconvenient facts. First, that Google’s dedicated news site, Google News, had precisely zero ads on its pages. And secondly, the pages on the main Google search engine that did have ads, had many other search hits alongside links to newspapers. And those links to newspaper sites send a considerable flow of traffic, that publishers have repeatedly shown they are desperate to have...."

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/revenge-of-the-hungry-cockatoos-spite-and-behavioural-ecology/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Parrot-OUPBlog2-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>&#8220;How do I stop a cockatoo from attacking my property?&#8221; This is the title of a real, honest-to-goodness Australian government webpage and advice document on the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment website. The webpage notes that flocks of cockatoos—sulphur-crested cockatoos especially—are known to “aggressively attack wood… decks, outdoor furniture, window sills, and houses” and that they particularly like the soft woods used in construction. The advice given ranges from making a scarecrow (or&nbsp;<em>scarecockatoo</em>, I suppose), to painting wood white, to spraying the birds with the hose (!), and it is recommended to persist in one’s chosen strategies until the birds leave, noting that this can take more than a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Most curiously, the page carefully elides the important question of why cockatoos attack—it says simply “there are many theories why they do this.” Ask an Australian, though, and the answer will be quickly forthcoming: the cockatoos are acting out of spite.&nbsp;</p><p>Most often, the supposed slight that caused the spite is the taking away of bird feeders. It may well be a case of confirmation bias, or simply of populations of hungry birds correlating within site of former bird feeders, but the story is usually told the same. “I normally put out bird seed in my garden, and all sorts of birds come and eat it, including the big cockatoos. One day, I forgot to put out the seed, and the cockatoos were clearly angry, and took it out on my house—they chewed right through my deck railing, and tore the weather stripping of my back windows!”</p><p>This superimposes a very human impulse onto the observed behaviour of the cockatoos: it looks and feels like revenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea that cockatoos are capable of human-like spite is a common one in Australia, driven both by the house-destructive behaviours and by videos and news stories of sulphur-crested cockatoos tearing off and destroying (seemingly with glee) the anti-bird spikes affixed to buildings to keep them away. I once saw a video of an activist who campaigns for better care for pet parrots destroying a small birdcage in front of the cockatoo who had been inappropriately kept in it, as the cockatoo squawked and head-bobbed and fanned his crest in what could only be described as celebration of the act of destruction. As human observers, watching the behaviours of these big, bold, intelligent birds, who are unafraid of showing us their emotions, it is very hard not to project human emotion onto the cockatoos.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8221; Spite is a very controversial matter when it comes to evolutionary biology and animal behaviour—and not everything that strikes us as spite at first look should really be given that name.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>But we have to be careful! Spite is a very controversial matter when it comes to evolutionary biology and animal behaviour—and not everything that strikes us as spite at first look should really be given that name. Take for example the anti-bird spikes. For a cockatoo that lives in a city, building ledges, street signs, and lamp posts are part of the bird’s (not-quite natural, but adopted) habitat. The bird has no concept of the purpose of the anti-bird spikes, because it has no concept of what is being prevented: property damage, cleaning costs, and public sanitation are not front-of-mind concerns for large parrots. The cockatoo does not see the spikes as an uncomfortable deterrent deliberately installed to keep it away, but merely as an environmental annoyance to be removed—like an ill-placed twig in a tree where it is trying to roost. So, like the twig, it destructively removes the spikes to make its environment more comfortable. The observing humans only see this as spiteful because we know what the bird does not—that the spikes were precisely designed and installed to make life less comfortable for the cockatoo.&nbsp;</p><p>Even supposing the cockatoo knew why the spikes were there, it still would not be spite because it has a material benefit to the cockatoo. It makes adaptive sense for the cockatoo to remove the spikes because it creates more space so that the cockatoo can comfortably and safely roost. A bit like having a car towed that has been improperly parked in your driveway, there may be a gruesome little bit of satisfaction, but it also has straightforward material benefit—you can park your own car in its proper place.&nbsp;</p><p>Animal behaviours that deal damage to other animals in exchange for benefit to the actor make evolutionary sense. Nature may be red in tooth and claw, but from the point of view of natural selection, dealing damage to obtain benefit is an easy calculation. From crippling parasites to territorial jostling to sexual competition, gaining a benefit at the expense of another animal is, unfortunately, how the natural world, and evolution, must often work.&nbsp;</p><p>What twists up the minds of evolutionary biologists though is the question of true spite: dealing damage to someone else at no benefit to yourself—just to hurt them. The human impulse to revenge has driven a lot of bad decisions in our history but it doesn’t make much evolutionary sense. Any action an animal takes, particularly violent and destructive actions, have a cost. That cost can be the chance of injury, the risk of retaliation, or just the physical energy expended; whatever it is, a well-adapted behaviour should not involve wasting energy and cost where there is no possible benefit to the actor. The cockatoos tearing up weather stripping are more like true spite. If the popular interpretation is true, and the cockatoos are retaliating after the house’s owner has stopped feeding them, the house destruction is costly spite on behalf of the birds. Cockatoos cannot eat wood or weather stripping, and in taking the time to rip up the house, they are wasting time that could be spent foraging elsewhere and risking potentially harmful retaliation (remember that hose?). The effort undertaken to destroy the house is pure spite—harming another with no chance of benefit to the cockatoos.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8221; Whilst we have to be careful about projecting our own emotions onto the behaviours of animals, that intelligence and social lifestyle is something we share with birds.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>Even here, though, we have to be careful. Part of a cockatoo’s natural behaviour includes chomping through wood in search of grubs and other food sources. It is conceivable that, in finding the usual bird-seed tray empty, the birds have sought to conserve energy by seeking other food sources in the immediate vicinity before moving on—including by searching the deck’s balustrade for tasty wood-boring grubs. As with every animal behaviour, we have to carefully interrogate the total environmental context of any behaviour before we draw conclusions about what might be going through the animal’s mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Spite, or revenge, is a very human idea. Our high level of intelligence and our highly social nature have resulted in our own species being all too capable of visiting non-adaptive, costly, damaging spite on our fellow humans—often harming ourselves in the pursuit of vengeance upon others. It is one of the uglier consequences of our remarkable brains. Whilst we have to be careful about projecting our own emotions onto the behaviours of animals, that intelligence and social lifestyle is something we share with birds, and especially with big, smart birds like cockatoos. Spite remains a controversial question in evolutionary biology—but it’s not surprising that one place we see truly spiteful behaviours that might just be real is in a bird that has so much in common with ourselves.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/687668708/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/687668708/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f03%2fParrot-OUPBlog2-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/history-repeats-yellow-fever-and-covid-19/">History repeats&#x2014;yellow fever and COVID-19</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/behind-the-cover-visualizing-human-centered-ai/">Behind the cover: Human-Centered AI</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/five-books-to-celebrate-british-science-week/">Five books to celebrate British Science Week</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-lost-genes-blood-mammal">Lost genes may help explain how vampire bats survive on blood alone</a></h4>

              
                <p>Surviving on blood alone is no picnic. But a handful of genetic tweaks may have helped vampire bats evolve to become the only mammal known to feed exclusively on the stuff.</p>



<p>These bats have developed a range of physiological and behavioral strategies to exist on a blood-only diet. The genetic picture behind this sanguivorous behavior, however, is still blurry. But <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm6494">13 genes that the bats appear to have lost</a> over time could underpin some of the behavior, researchers report March 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Sometimes losing genes in evolutionary time frames can actually be adaptive or beneficial,” says Michael Hiller, a genomicist now at the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research in Frankfurt.</p>





<p>Hiller and his colleagues pieced together the genetic instruction book of the common vampire bat (<em>Desmodus rotundus</em>) and compared it with the genomes of 26 other bat species, including six from the same family as vampire bats. The team then searched for genes in <em>D. rotundus </em>that had either been lost entirely or inactivated through mutations.</p>



<p>Of the 13 missing genes, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2014.1079">three had been previously reported in vampire bats</a>. These genes are associated with sweet and bitter taste receptors in other animals, meaning vampire bats probably have a diminished sense of taste — all the better for drinking blood. The other 10 lost genes are newly identified in the bats, and the researchers propose several ideas about how the absence of these genes could support a blood-rich diet.</p>



<p>Some of the genes help to raise levels of insulin in the body and convert ingested sugar into a form that can be stored. Given the low sugar content of blood, this processing and storage system may be less active in vampire bats and the genes probably aren’t that useful anymore. Another gene is linked in other mammals to gastric acid production, which helps break down solid food. That gene may have been lost as the vampire bat stomach evolved to mostly store and absorb fluid.</p>



<p>One of the other lost genes inhibits the uptake of iron in gastrointestinal cells. Blood is low in calories yet rich in iron. Vampire bats must drink up to 1.4 times their own weight during each feed, and, in doing so, ingest a potentially harmful amount of iron. Gastrointestinal cells are regularly shed in the vampire bat gut, so by losing that gene, the bats may be absorbing huge amounts of iron and quickly excreting it to avoid an overload — an idea supported by previous research.</p>



<p>One lost gene could even be linked to vampire bats’ remarkable cognitive abilities, the researchers suggest. Because the bats are susceptible to starvation, they share regurgitated blood and are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/vampire-bats-share-blood-make-friends">more likely to do so with bats</a> that previously donated to themselves (<em>SN: 11/19/15</em>). Vampire bats also form <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-friendships-endure-captivity-wild">long-term bonds</a> and even feed with their friends <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bats-drink-blood-friends-strangers-social">in the wild</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/19; SN: 9/23/21</em>). In other animals, this gene is involved in breaking down a compound produced by nerve cells that is linked to learning and memory — traits thought to be necessary for the vampire bats’ social abilities.</p>



<p>“I think there are some compelling hypotheses there,” says David Liberles, an evolutionary genomicist at Temple University in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study. It would be interesting to see if these genes were also lost in the other two species of vampire bats, he says, as they feed more on the blood of birds, while <em>D. rotundus</em> prefers to imbibe from mammals.</p>



<p>Whether the diet caused these changes, or vice versa, isn’t known. Either way, it was probably a gradual process over millions of years, Hiller says. “Maybe they started drinking more and more blood, and then you have time to better adapt to this very challenging diet.”</p>

<p>The sperm whale is an endangered species. A major reason is that the whale oil is heat-resistant and chemically and physically stable. This makes it useful for lubricating delicate machinery. The only substitute is expensive carnauba wax from the leaves of palm trees that grow only in Brazil … [but] wax from the seeds of the jojoba, an evergreen desert shrub, is nearly as good.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>After sperm whale oil was banned in the early 1970s, the United States sought to replenish its reserves with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/blooming-desert-project">eco-friendly oil from jojoba seeds</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/75, p.&nbsp;335</em>). Jojoba oil’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shrub-rivals-whale-producing-prized-oil">chemical structure</a> is nearly identical to that of sperm whale oil, and the shrub is native to some North American desert ecosystems, making the plant an appealing replacement. Today, jojoba shrubs are cultivated around the world on almost every continent. Jojoba oil is used in hundreds of products, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, adhesives and lubricants. Meanwhile, sperm whale populations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-us-commercial-whaling-was-coming-to-an-end">have started to recover</a> under international anti-whaling agreements (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 4</em>).</p>

                <p>For weeks, I have been watching coronavirus cases drop across the United States. At the same time, cases were heading skyward in many places in Europe, Asia and Oceania. Those surges may have peaked in some places and seem to be on a&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48c862746a73d62a338bf35c2e664b06073e732262c4cbaba01739cf2d048f99fd16ee394d0431577e9efa5408a4e78978">downward trajectory again</a>, according to Our World in Data.<br><br>Much of the rise in cases has been attributed to the omicron variant’s more transmissible sibling BA.2 clawing its way to prominence. But many public health officials have pointed out that the&nbsp;surges coincide with relaxing of COVID-19 mitigation measures.&nbsp;<br><br>People around the world are shedding their masks and gathering in public. Immunity from vaccines and prior infections have helped limit deaths in wealthier countries, but the omicron siblings are very good at evading immune defenses, leading to breakthrough infections and reinfections. Even so, at the end of February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48ae04c4dd00ce71f2e3239f8b18640d095075bdb264fdb01a43b3dc2c9b460e3aae0da487b1b4b30f0926119effa4a94f">new guidelines for masking</a>, more than doubling the number of cases needed per 100,000 people before officials recommended a return to the face coverings (<em>SN: 3/3/22</em>).<br><br>Not everyone has ditched their masks. I have observed some regional trends. The majority of people I see at my grocery store and other places in my community in Maryland are still wearing masks. But on road trips to the Midwest and back, even during the height of the omicron surge, most of the faces I saw in public were bare. Meanwhile, I was wearing my N95 mask even when I was the only person doing so. I reasoned that I was protecting myself from infection as best I could. I was also protecting my loved ones and other people around me from me should I have unwittingly contracted the virus.<br><br>But I will tell you a secret. I don’t really like wearing masks. They can be hot and uncomfortable. They leave lines on my face. And sometimes masks make it hard to breathe. At the same time, I know that wearing a good quality, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting mask</a> greatly reduces the chance of testing positive for the coronavirus (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). In one study, N95 or KN95 masks&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48b64aa5bed5773142f5a6e81517303748c2c3482eeda16f4b07cd5d39eca620fd363e6e732c5bfb86250ea3f3cc7ad91c">reduced the chance of testing positive by 83 percent</a>, researchers reported in the February 11&nbsp;<em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;And school districts with mask mandates had about a&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de486f7586a2be8b0c92ef822a38484a0a28025a01eb96158bc71074b0ceeae2ba19b5e3bff06b5a092ea4a9cfd42f15078a">quarter of the number of in-school infections</a> as districts where masks weren’t required (<em>SN: 3/15/22</em>).<br><br>With those data in mind, I am not ready to go barefaced. And I’m not alone. Nearly 36 percent of the 1,916 respondents to a&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de4877812227397aab2646636276149de530128de8573d67a01596d7b123f4b16a5c7545bc5321ee13856b3b3f8ad4e0be00"><em>Science News&nbsp;</em>Twitter poll</a>&nbsp;said that they still wear masks everywhere in public. Another 28 percent said they mask in indoor crowds, and 23 percent said they mask only where it’s mandatory. Only about 12 percent have ditched masks entirely.<br><br>Some poll respondents left comments clarifying their answers, but most people’s reasons for masking aren’t clear. Maybe they live in the parts of the country or world where transmission levels are high and hospitals are at risk of being overrun. Maybe they are parents of children too young for vaccination. Perhaps they or other loved ones are unvaccinated or have weakened immune systems that put them at risk for severe disease. Maybe, like me, they just don’t want to get sick — with anything.<br><br>Before the pandemic, I caught several colds a year and had to deal with seasonal allergies. Since I started wearing a mask, I haven’t had a single respiratory illness, though allergies still irritate my eyes and make my nose run. I’ve also got some health conditions that raise my risk of severe illness. I’m&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de484ac015b1da33343900eb7f511ab6844df531d2a3aa0020d1a9d1a71f693b8560fb8925cc3c244e6cc84cf256e984609e">fully vaccinated and boosted</a>, so I probably won’t die if I catch the virus that causes COVID-19, but I don’t want to test it <em>(SN: 11/8/21</em>). Right now, I just feel safer wearing a mask when I’m indoors in public places.<br><br>I’ve been thinking a lot about what would convince me that it was safe to go maskless. What is the number or metric that will mark the boundary of my comfort zone?<br><br>The CDC now recommends using its&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de4805160b5df26e56ef1d0a71f7b2caaabbddd0f7fdb6b53e9bda9b866cea078bc6d56197c3872283fa7524f9c25893004d">COVID-19 Community Levels</a>&nbsp;map for determining when mask use is needed. That metric is mostly concerned with keeping hospitals and other health care systems from becoming overwhelmed. By that measure, most of the country has the green light to go maskless. I’m probably more cautious than the average person, but the levels of transmission in that metric that would trigger mask wearing — 200 or more cases per 100,000 population — seem high to me, particularly since CDC’s prior recommendations urged masking at a quarter of that level.<br><br>The metric is designed for communities, not individuals. So what numbers should I, as an individual, go by? There’s always the&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48d1f00c5ec4cc1528e12ea7129feb69578ea8bb2ee7d04be016298d895ab8ac899918609bc2224d1d326ea41f7cabe154">CDC’s COVID-19 Integrated County View</a>&nbsp;that tracks case rates and test positivity rates — the percentage of tests that have a positive result. Cases in my county have been ticking up in the last few days, with 391 people having gotten COVID-19 in the last week — that’s about 37 out of every 100,000 people. That seems like relatively low odds of coming into contact with a contagious person. But those are only the cases we know about officially. There may be many more cases that were never reported as people take rapid antigen tests at home or decide not to test. There’s no way to know exactly how much COVID-19 is out there.<br><br>And the proportion of&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48686dc752320ec3321a11c9bac98b41cfe03e5a500c742a3d27666ff0c787c96a98cb257106d3efc19d39d3d4b2799af5">cases caused by BA.2 is on the rise</a>, with the more infectious omicron variant accounting for about 35 percent of cases nationwide in the week ending March 19. In the mid-Atlantic states where I live, about 30 percent of cases are now caused by BA.2. But in some parts of the Northeast, that variant now causes more than half of cases. The increase is unsettling but doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will experience another wave of infections as Europe has. Or maybe we will. That uncertainty makes me uncomfortable removing my mask indoors in public right now.<br><br>Maybe in a few weeks, if there’s no new surge in infections, I’ll feel comfortable walking around in public with my nose and mouth exposed. Or maybe I’ll wait until the number of cases in my county is in single digits. I’m pretty sure there will come a day when I won’t feel the need to filter every breath, but for me, it’s not that time yet. And I truthfully can’t tell you what my magic number will be.<br><br>Here’s what I do know: Even if I do decide to have an unmasked summer, I will be strapping my mask back on if COVID-19 cases begin to rise again.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boa-constrictor-snake-squeeze-prey-without-suffocating">Here’s how boa constrictors squeeze their dinner without suffocating themselves</a></h4>

              
                <p>The boa constrictor’s choke hold is an iconic animal attack. By coiling around its prey, a snake can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boa-suffocation-merely-myth">squeeze the life out of a victim</a> in mere minutes before gulping it down whole (<em>SN: 8/9/15</em>). But it’s been unclear just how <em>Boa constrictor</em> squeezes so hard — or swallows something as big as a monkey — without suffocating itself.</p>



<p>Now, experiments show that when one part of a boa constrictor’s rib cage is compressed — preventing the part of its lungs enclosed there from drawing in air — <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.243119">the snake can move another section of its rib cage</a> to inflate its lungs there. Boas and other snakes probably couldn’t have started throttling and swallowing large prey without this ability, researchers report March 24 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Biologist John Capano of Brown University in Providence, R.I., and colleagues implanted metal markers on the ribs of three boa constrictors, about one-third and halfway down the animals’ bodies. Tracking those markers in X-ray videos of the animals let the researchers map rib motions over different parts of the snakes’ lungs.</p>





<p>In these videos, the team wrapped a blood pressure cuff around different parts of the animals’ bodies. Then, the scientists increased the cuff’s pressure until the rib cage couldn’t move in that area — mimicking the effect of a snake using that part of its body to grip or gulp down prey.</p>



<p>When gripped by a cuff about one-third of the way down their body, snakes breathed by moving some ribs closer to their tails. When wrapped in a cuff about halfway down their body, snakes breathed by moving some ribs closer to their heads. “They can basically just breathe wherever they want,” Capano says. That makes him wonder whether snakes also adjust their breathing during other activities that compress their bodies, such as slithering.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">Forests help reduce global warming in more ways than one</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to cooling the planet, forests have more than one trick up their trees. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tropical forests help cool the average global temperature by more than 1 degree Celsius, a new study finds. The effect stems largely from forests’ capacity to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">capture and store atmospheric carbon</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/21</em>). But around <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.756115/full">one-third of that tropical cooling effect</a> comes from several other processes, such as the release of water vapor and aerosols, researchers report March 24 in <em>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change.</em></p>



<p>“We tend to focus on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, but forests are not just carbon sponges,” says Deborah Lawrence, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. “It&#8217;s time to think about what else forests are doing for us besides just absorbing carbon dioxide.”</p>





<p>Researchers already knew that forests influence their local climates through various physical and chemical processes. Trees release water vapor through pores in their leaves — a process called evapotranspiration — and, like human sweating, this cools the trees and their surroundings. Also, uneven forest canopies can have a cooling effect, as they provide an undulating surface that can bump hot, overpassing fronts of air upward and away. What’s more, trees generate aerosols that can lower temperatures by reflecting sunlight and seeding clouds.</p>



<p>But on a global scale, it wasn’t clear how these other cooling benefits compared with the cooling provided by forests’ capturing of carbon dioxide, Lawrence says.</p>





<p>So she and her colleagues analyzed how the complete deforestation of different regions would impact global temperatures, using data gathered from other studies. For instance, the researchers used forest biomass data to determine how much the release of carbon stored by those forests would warm the global temperature. They then compared those results with other studies’ estimates of how much the loss of other aspects of forests — such as evapotranspiration, uneven canopies and aerosol production — affected regional and global temperatures.</p>



<p>The researchers found that in forests at latitudes from around 50° S of the equator to 50° N, the primary way that forests influenced the global average temperature was through carbon sequestration. But those other cooling factors still played large roles.</p>



<p>Forests located from 30° N to 30° S provided alternative benefits that cool the planet by over 0.3 degrees C, about half as much cooling as carbon sequestration provided. And the bulk of that cooling, around 0.2 degrees C, came from forests in the core of the tropics (within 10° of the equator). Canopy topography generally provided the greatest cooling, followed by evapotranspiration and then aerosols.</p>



<p>Forests in the far north, however, appear to have a net warming effect, the team reports. Clearing the boreal forests — which stretch across Canada, Alaska, Russia and Scandinavia — would expose more snow cover during the winter. This would decrease ground level temperatures because snow reflects much of the incoming sunlight back into the sky. Still, the researchers found that altogether, the world’s forests cool the global average temperature about 0.5 degrees C.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that global and regional climate action efforts should refrain from focusing solely on carbon emissions, Lawrence says. “There&#8217;s this whole service that tropical forests are providing that simply are not visible to us or to policy makers.”</p>



<p>The research shows that clearing tropical forests robs us of many climate-cooling benefits, says Gabriel de Oliveira, a geographer from the University of South Alabama in Mobile. But deforestation isn’t the only way that humans impair forests’ cooling ability, he says. Many forests are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">damaged by fires</a> or selective logging, and are less able to help with cooling (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>). It would be useful to consider how forest degradation, in addition to deforestation, impacts regional and global climate temperatures, de Oliveira says, to assess the impact of restoring and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">protecting forests</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/21</em>). “It&#8217;s cool to see beyond carbon dioxide, but it&#8217;s also very important to see beyond deforestation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/past-science-news-coverage-racism-sexism">Some past Science News coverage was racist and sexist. We’re deeply sorry</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-white-color has-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em>Content warning: This essay about aspects of </em>Science News<em>’ coverage cites specific examples of racism, sexism and prejudice against members of the LGBTQ community and others. We have chosen to link to the examples to be transparent about our failings.</em></p>



<p>In late 2019, with the 100th birthday of <em>Science News</em> a few years off, our team considered how we might celebrate. We realized that inviting the world to explore the more than 80,000 original reports of advances in science, medicine and technology in our archive was an obvious choice.</p>



<p>Newspaper magnate Edward W. Scripps and zoologist William E. Ritter founded Science Service, the original name of the news organization, to provide accurate, engaging news of science to the public. “The success of democratic government as well as the prosperity of the individual may be said to depend upon the ability of the people to distinguish between real science and fake,” wrote our founding editor Edwin Slosson in 1921.</p>





<p>But Science Service didn’t always live up to those ideals. As we planned for our centennial, we knew that alongside stories chronicling great feats of science there would be articles that we now find horrifying. Through much of its early history, this organization widely shared, and in some cases endorsed, ideas that were racist, sexist, xenophobic and otherwise prejudiced, as well as supposedly “scientific” justifications for immoral and unethical behavior.</p>



<p>We are deeply sorry.</p>



<p>Other publications, universities and nonprofit organizations have recently reckoned with their pasts. Our own efforts to grapple with previous coverage turned up specific examples of racism, sexism and prejudice against members of the LGBTQ community and others in reporting from the 1920s through the 1960s. Though the examples discussed below will be hurtful to some readers, we believe doing better in the future requires an honest and transparent examination of our past.</p>



<p>Our most egregious failing was our supportive coverage of eugenics, a field of study and associated practices born from the false belief that humankind could be improved if only the people judged to have the most desirable traits were allowed to reproduce. Francis Galton, a British polymath who coined the term in the late 1800s, wrote that eugenics would “give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slosson and several of our founding board members were proponents of eugenics, which gained popularity in scientific communities in the United States in the early 1900s. But research of the day did not support the assertion that one group of people was genetically superior to another, and today’s science outright refutes that assertion.</p>



<p>Eugenics was used to justify racial, ethnic and other forms of discrimination. It led to the <a href="https://www.ssjlab.org/">forced sterilization of over 60,000 people in the United States</a>, including immigrants, Black people, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, people in prisons and people facing poverty.&nbsp;It shaped immigration policies that kept Southern and Eastern Europeans out of the country for decades.</p>



<p>In the 1930s, Nazi Germany enlisted scientists and physicians to argue that society needed to be “cleansed” of people who posed a threat to its “genetic health.” Eugenic theories shaped Nazi policies of persecution and so <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/eugenics">contributed to the murders of millions of people</a> in the Holocaust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Research of the day did not support the assertion that one group of people was genetically superior to another, and today’s science outright refutes that assertion.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>Science News</em>, previously named <em>Science News Letter, </em>often covered eugenics approvingly, <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n9tv9hzzhr/6">especially during the 1920s and 1930s</a>. Watson Davis, who served at Slosson’s right hand, was director of Science Service from 1933 to 1966 and probably did more than anyone to shape editorial direction in our early decades; he was also on the board of the American Eugenics Society, a clear conflict of interest for a journalist.</p>



<p>In a 1922 article, Slosson equated population growth in districts in Great Britain that had overcrowding, poor education, high rates of death from tuberculosis and infant diseases with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-26-1922">“evolution working backward</a>.” An article from 1924 quotes eugenicists advocating for “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/immigration-selection">numerical limitation and careful selection of immigrants</a>.” Another from 1935 was headlined “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sterilization-urged-prevent-blindness">Sterilization is urged to prevent blindness</a>.”</p>



<p>In the late 1930s, <em>Science News Letter</em> reported on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mans-control-over-life-prime-science-contact">how proponents of eugenics </a>sought to distance themselves from sterilization policies aimed at specific social, economic and racial groups. Yet this reporting included the disturbing passage: “On the average, it is found that those parents who provide the best home training for their children are also those with the best genetic stock.” And a headline from 1940 read, “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-6">Eugenics seen as vital to future of democracy</a>.”</p>



<p>It’s not as if eugenics didn’t have critics at the time. Renowned anthropologist Franz Boas denounced it as early as 1916 and continued to do so throughout his career; he saw race as a social not biological construct. Anthropologist Ashley Montagu challenged what he called “the fallacy of race.” Other scientists pointed out that people’s living conditions played a major role in their health and behavior — it was not just nature, but also nurture. <em>Science News</em> in some cases covered these ideas, but for the most part failed to recognize them (or report on them) as counterpoints to eugenics.&nbsp;<ins></ins></p>



<p>Uncritical coverage of eugenics in <em>Science News</em> picked up again in the 1960s, during a resurgence in eugenic ideas. In 1964, the magazine published an article by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-future">Frederick Osborn</a>, chairman of the board of editors of the American Eugenics Society, who was leading the rebranding of eugenics as an effort aimed at “saving genes for superior ability wherever they are found.”</p>



<p>Our early coverage was often racist, assumed white superiority and debased Indigenous cultures. An <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/negro-ancestor-man">article from 1954</a> summarized the thoughts of one anthropologist, saying, “a Negro may have been black before he was a man.” Another <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/american-children-claimed-more-intelligent-chinese">from 1925 was headlined</a> “American children claimed more intelligent than Chinese.” An article in 1921 on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/july-18-1921">coming popularity of the avocado</a> described the raising of the fruit as a “white man’s job” because it required “a high order of intelligence.”</p>



<p>Coverage of women was focused primarily on their role as family caretaker. Issues of women’s rights, reproductive health, welfare and education received comparatively little attention. In a 1924 article titled, “How women control the future,” Slosson wrote that women’s right to vote was insignificant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/how-women-control-the-future">in relation to the role the woman has in the family</a>.</p>



<p>Women were disparaged in other ways in our reporting. Headlines in particular were often patronizing or fed into existing stereotypes: “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/women-fatigue-easily-during-first-work-days">Women fatigue easily during first work days</a>,” for example. A story headlined “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/womens-personalities-do-not-depend-age">Women’s personalities do not depend on age</a>” led with, &#8220;A middle-aged woman may not have the figure of a young lady, but her emotional make-up is essentially the same.” An article from the 1960s quoted a source who blamed the issue of “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/no-women-space">No women in space</a>” at least in part on the challenges of designing spacesuits for women, without any question or criticism.</p>



<p>Our coverage of the LGBTQ community through much of the 1950s and 1960s failed to question science that perpetuated bias, including characterizing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/lsd-sociopaths">gay men as having a “pathological personality</a>.” We reported on<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rational-psychotherapy-cures-one-homosexual"> psychotherapy that “cured” one gay man</a>. One headline read: “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/homosexuals-need-help">Homosexuals need help</a>.”</p>



<p>We were wrong in other ways. The same spirit of science boosterism that championed eugenics seems to have been behind enthusiasm for less sinister but still dangerous notions, including a 1945 article touting the use of the pesticide <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ddt-can-wipe-out-plagues">DDT in wall paint</a>, and one from 1964 suggesting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-dangers-overrated">the use of nuclear explosives</a> to dig a new Panama Canal. And, yes, in the late 1940s, we touted the marvels of asbestos-laden dish towels, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/dishtowels-asbestos">actually distributed them to readers</a>.</p>



<p>Hindsight is of course easy, and some historians will warn us against applying today’s knowledge and perspectives to different times. With the exception of our 1960s eugenics coverage, our reporting was for the most part consistent with prevailing views among the people in power at the time. Yet we wish <em>Science News</em> had followed a different course. As journalists, we need to be skeptical and ask tough questions. It’s humbling to see that <em>Science News</em> journalists a century ago got so much wrong, and it pushes us to strive to do better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>We believe doing better in the future requires an honest and transparent examination of our past.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>So we ask ourselves, what are our current biases? Where are the gaps in our coverage? When are we narrow-minded? Whose voices are we amplifying and whose experiences are we omitting?</p>



<p>We are taking action to address our shortcomings. We have prioritized increasing the diversity of our staff through hiring. Because staff turnover can be slow, we are also seeking out freelance writers from countries and communities historically underrepresented in our coverage, as well as editors from those communities, who help us identify potential biases in story selection and language use. For several years, our writers have been growing an effort to track source diversity, which expanded after the Black Lives Matter movement gained national attention. They are holding themselves accountable for interviewing and quoting scientists with a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. And we are participating in staff training in diversity, equity and inclusion through the Poynter Institute and other organizations.</p>



<p>We are also looking to what science can tell us about bias, race and diversity. We increased coverage of the social sciences, including the challenges scientists face in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/census-2020-race-ethnicity-questions">defining race in the U.S. Census</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/psychology-harm-racism-health">negative effects of racism on physical and mental health</a> and how scientists are trying to study <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">racial bias in policing</a>. And we are reporting on how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">misinformation and disinformation about science</a> warps people’s understanding of crucial issues such as climate change and COVID-19 vaccines.</p>



<p>Science will be key to building a safe and sustainable future for humankind and our planet. Though Slosson, our founding editor, didn’t always live up to his own ideals, we endorse his statement from a century ago that the ability of people to understand science, and distinguish between real science and fake, is essential to society’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know our efforts moving forward will be imperfect. We suspect if <em>Science News </em>survives another century, our future colleagues will look back on some of what we did with dismay. Yet we hope reckoning with our past, being transparent about what was terrible alongside what was great, will help us hold ourselves accountable today. And we ask our readers to hold us accountable as well.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-journalism-history-century-birthday">We’re celebrating a century of Science News</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The first three months of covering the COVID-19 pandemic felt, by Tina Hesman Saey’s estimation, “closer to 300 years.” From February to April 2020, the <em>Science News</em> senior molecular biology writer had produced a flurry of stories on the new coronavirus that wove together findings from dozens of scientific papers and reports. Her hours were long and stress levels high. But the science wasn’t slowing down, so neither could she.</p>



<p>“We’re in a hyperdrive situation,” Saey said in May 2020, reflecting on her pandemic reporting. “It’s amazing how fast the science is moving.” In mere months, researchers had completely overhauled their understanding of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus infiltrates the body, and vaccines were already in the works. Readers were counting on Saey and her <em>Science News</em> colleagues to sift through the deluge of information pouring out of labs across the world. “The information that they get from us can really help them make life-or-death decisions,” Saey said.</p>



<p>Since then, Saey and other <em>Science News </em>reporters have cranked out hundreds of stories on SARS-CoV-2’s basic virology, new variants, vaccine rollouts and more. To boost public understanding of the new coronavirus, <em>Science News</em> has freely offered its COVID-19 stories to local and nonprofit news organizations since April 2020. &nbsp;</p>





<p>“What <em>Science News</em> provided was authoritative reporting and in-depth articles on what we’re all talking about and what we’re all worried about,” <em>Cleveland Scene </em>editor in chief Vince Grzegorek said after his publication started reprinting <em>Science News</em> coverage. Whether a story was about the importance of masking up or the riskiness of in-person shopping, Grzegorek said, “what people can read from <em>Science News</em> on our site is going to go a lot further than a 45-second spot on the local [news] station.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Science News</em>’ push to get reliable reporting in front of as many eyes as possible harks back to before the publication was even a magazine. A little over a century ago, <em>Science News</em> got its start as <em>Science News Bulletin</em> — the first syndicated news specializing in science.</p>



<p>“There certainly had been media coverage of science before,” says Bruce Lewenstein of Cornell University, who studies science communication. But that coverage was more sporadic and often plagued with sensationalism and superstition.</p>



<p>Newspaper magnate Edward W. Scripps, who believed that a functioning democracy required a science-savvy public, wanted to get more accurate, reliable science news in the public eye. To do that, Scripps teamed up with his zoologist friend William E. Ritter to form a new organization for science communication in 1921. Based in Washington, D.C., Science Service — now known as the Society for Science — was funded by Scripps and overseen by a board of 15 scientists and journalists. That board of trustees included famed astronomer George Ellery Hale and Edwin Gay, president of the <em>New York Evening Post</em>.</p>

<p>“Science Service was formed at a critical time for science and public understanding of science,” says Susan Swanberg, who studies the history of science journalism at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In the early 20th century, the pace of scientific discovery was making it harder for nonexperts to keep up. At the same time, World War I, nicknamed “the chemists’ war” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/materials-plastics-polymers-fiber-optics-history">for the use of chemical weapons</a> on the battlefield, had heightened many people’s uncertainty about, and interest in, science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scripps and Ritter hoped their new organization would help bridge the gap between scientists and the public. When Science Service announced its debut in the journal <em>Science</em> in April 1921, the organization branded itself as “a sort of liaison officer between scientific circles and the outside world.” In this go-between role, Science Service hoped to foster popular support for science while helping people become more well-informed citizens. That same month, Science Service launched <em>Science News Bulletin</em>, a weekly — then daily — dispatch of stories to subscribing newspapers across the country. This marked the first sustained effort to provide engaging, accurate news about scientific research to a national U.S. audience.</p>



<p>By October 1921, the bulletin fed more than 30 subscribing newspapers with a combined circulation of more than 1.5 million readers. Libraries, schools and science enthusiasts started requesting copies of the bulletin to keep for themselves. In response, Science Service began bundling its dispatches into a stand-alone publication, dubbed <em>Science News-Letter</em>. Readers got the first issue 100 years ago this month, in March 1922. The publication became <em>Science News</em> in 1966.</p>



<h4>Slosson, Scopes and syndication</h4>



<p>Science Service’s first editor, Edwin Slosson, fancied himself a “renegade from natural science.” A chemist-turned-writer who had worked as a magazine editor and authored science books, he shared Scripps and Ritter’s belief that democracy hinged on scientific literacy — and that science didn’t need to be overhyped to capture readers’ imaginations.</p>



<p>“It is not necessary,” Slosson <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/education-science-and-democracy">wrote in <em>Science News-Letter</em></a>, “to pervert scientific truths in the process of translation into the vernacular. The facts are sensational enough without any picturesque exaggeration.”</p>



<p>When Slosson took charge of Science Service in 1921, his challenge was not finding interesting science to write about. It was finding journalists to do the writing. Science journalism was a new field. And without an established pool of reporters to call on, Slosson reportedly spent his first month at Science Service begging friends to write articles for him, only to spend the next month, as he put it, “sending the articles back and telling them how rotten they were in such polite language as to induce them to send soon some better ones.”</p>



<p>But not all of Slosson’s early searches for science writers turned up disappointments. He did find Watson Davis — or rather, Watson Davis found him. The 25-year-old journalist and engineer was allegedly waiting on Science Service’s front steps to ask for a job when Slosson showed up for his first day at work.</p>

<p>“Davis had the instincts of a journalist and an engineer’s ability to organize,” historian Marcel Chotkowski LaFollette wrote in a <a href="http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/12-1/lafollette.htm">2006 article</a> about Science Service. “He could ferret out news and glean the essence from dull research reports, and proved to be a skilled manager.” Those traits served Davis well as Slosson’s right-hand man, and later as the director of Science Service from 1933 to 1966.</p>



<p><em>Science News-Letter</em>’s earliest stories set the stage for the magazine’s coverage over the next century. Readers learned about news on the biggest scientific happenings, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/october-28-1922">discovery that insulin could treat diabetes</a>, as well as curious everyday insights, such as what foods help houseflies live longer — detailed in a story charmingly titled “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/how-feed-flies-case-you-love-them">How to feed flies in case you love them</a>.”</p>



<p>For Science Service writers, the name of the game was transforming the dry language typical of scientific papers into compelling narratives. But having staked its reputation on scientific accuracy, Science Service was careful to avoid sensationalism. Writers couldn’t risk alienating their scientist sources. Biology editor Frank Thone, for instance, once wrote a story describing insects that were “just as fond of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/modern-insects-heat">bright lights, a hot time and fast living</a>” as their human counterparts — after which Thone sent a rather sheepish note to the researcher asking for forgiveness for the jazzy language.</p>



<p>Sometimes, Science Service’s deference to the scientific community went so far that, by today’s standards, it broke the code of journalistic objectivity. Perhaps the most striking example was Science Service’s involvement in the Scopes “Monkey Trial” of 1925, when high school science teacher John Scopes was put on trial for breaking a Tennessee law that forbade teaching evolution. Leading up to the trial, <em>Science News-Letter</em> printed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientists-pledge-support-tennessee-professor-arrested-teaching-evolution">pledge of support for Scopes</a> by the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In another article, Davis proclaimed that anyone could see Scopes was in the right “if men will but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rocks-and-hills-dayton-testify-evolution">use their eyes and their brains</a>.”</p>

<p>Science Service went far beyond editorializing in its coverage of the trial. The organization helped Scopes’ lawyers find expert witnesses to testify on his behalf. And when Davis and Thone traveled to Tennessee to cover the trial, they moved into the Victorian mansion that Scopes’ legal team was using as headquarters.</p>



<p>“All day long and far into the night, the rumble of scientific discussion and laughter issues forth from Defense Mansion,” Thone wrote, calling the place “the headquarters for the defenders of science, religion and freedom.”</p>



<p>From a 21st century perspective, the whole affair was completely inappropriate. But LaFollette doesn’t judge Science Service too harshly. “We must be careful in applying retrospectively contemporary standards,” says LaFollette, whose 2008 book <em>Reframing Scopes</em> explores Science Service’s role in the trial. The modern code of journalistic ethics was not as formal in the early 20th century as it is now, she says, and back then many journalists were more comfortable cozying up to their sources.</p>



<p>“Davis and Thone believed they were doing the right thing by assisting the Scopes defense,” LaFollette says. After all, in its 1921 debut announcement in the journal <em>Science</em>, Science Service had sworn it would “not indulge in propaganda, unless it be propaganda to urge the value of research and the usefulness of science.”</p>

<p>A decade after its birth, <em>Science News Letter</em> — which abandoned its hyphen in 1930 — had earned a reputation for top-quality, accurate coverage. Thomas Edison gave the magazine permission to print excerpts from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/edison-and-slosson-talked-many-things">conversations Edison had with Slosson</a> in the twilight years of Edison’s life. In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt reportedly <a href="https://centennial.societyforscience.org/">commissioned </a>Science Service to collect statistics on women working in government science jobs. And in 1936, the <em>Science News Letter</em> staff <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/amateur-who-helped-einstein-see-light">arranged a meeting</a> between Albert Einstein and engineer Rudi Mandl, who was working as a dishwasher. Mandl convinced Einstein to publish a paper on a then-theoretical curiosity known as gravitational lensing. It turned out to be a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">very real phenomenon</a> that today’s astronomers use like a cosmic magnifying glass to peer at the distant universe.</p>



<p>Throughout the 1920s, Science Service sold articles to over 100 newspapers, potentially reaching more than 7 million people. During the Great Depression, newspaper subscriptions to Science Service’s syndicated material took a hit, but individual subscriptions to <em>Science News Letter</em> rose steadily. The magazine kept its readers in the know about a range of fields, announcing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mould-kills-bacteria">discovery of penicillin</a> —which one reporter mused “may turn out to be a useful antiseptic” — and tracking the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/uncertainty-principle-enters-science">emerging field of quantum mechanics</a>. The magazine deemed this new realm of physics both revolutionary and “disturbing.”</p>



<p>Science Service’s reporting was seminal in the emerging field of science writing, according to science and society researcher Dorothy Nelkin’s 1995 book <em>Selling Science</em>. “It laid the foundation for contemporary science journalism,” Nelkin wrote, “giving the profession both a purpose and a style.”</p>



<h4>The war years</h4>



<p>In 1936, Science Service helped throw one of the nerdiest dinner parties of all time.</p>



<p>By then, Science Service had grown to include several pioneers of science journalism, including acclaimed medical reporter Jane Stafford and psychology writer Marjorie Van de Water. “They were an extremely intelligent group of people,” LaFollette says. “If you couldn’t write quickly, think quickly, you didn’t last long in that newsroom.” But the staff wasn’t all serious all the time.</p>

<p>One particularly extravagant display of the team’s playful spirit was a celebration that Science Service helped organize in November 1936 honoring the centennial of the U.S. patent system. Politicians and scientists gathered in Washington, D.C., for an afternoon “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/research-parade-preview-sciences-aid-industry">research parade</a>” hosted by Davis, where inventors showed off their various gadgets. At the banquet that followed, tables were decked out with patented hybrid flowers, and guests dined from a menu that listed the patent number for each food and drink. The entertainment featured a phonograph recording of the late Thomas Edison and a radio show broadcast from a plane flying overhead.</p>



<p>Science Service’s unbridled enthusiasm for the scientific enterprise was often its greatest asset. But staff members’ devotion to particular topics sometimes led to uncritical coverage. One prominent example was eugenics, a scientific and social movement in the United States and Europe in the 20th century that aimed to “improve” humankind by selectively breeding for desirable traits or breeding out undesirable ones. Such “undesirable” traits could be anything from mental and physical disabilities to supposed moral failings, such as promiscuity. Eugenics influenced U.S. immigration policies as well as laws that led to the forced sterilization of over 60,000 people in the United States.</p>

<p>“By the time Science Service was created … eugenics had become well-established, both in the sciences and as a sort of popular political, culture and social movement,” says Emily Rader, an independent historian based in Long Beach, Calif., who was commissioned last year by <em>Science News</em> to provide an outside analysis of the publication’s eugenics coverage. “<em>Science News</em> published a lot of articles about eugenics in the 1920s and 1930s,” Rader says. That was perhaps not surprising, given that Davis was a board member of the American Eugenics Society. “There were almost no articles that brought up criticism of eugenics,” Rader says, even though some biologists and social scientists at the time had pointed out its problems.</p>



<p>In November 1933, for instance, the magazine published a story about American eugenicists praising Hitler’s new Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases. That law allowed the forced sterilization of several groups of people, including those who were born blind or deaf, and those who suffered from epilepsy or alcoholism. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/eugenicists-approve-new-german-law">The <em>Science News Letter</em> article</a> quoted an editorial from <em>Eugenical News</em> that said: “It is difficult to see how the new German Sterilization Law could, as some have suggested … be made an ‘instrument of tyranny.’”</p>



<p>Science Service’s “frequent failure to report alternative viewpoints, its gushing coverage of sterilization statutes and approving report about Germany’s new eugenics law, all suggest that the science news agency had wandered into the realm of propaganda,” Swanberg, of the University of Arizona, wrote in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08821127.2021.1912754">2021 article in <em>American Journalism</em></a> about <em>Science News Letter</em>’s eugenics coverage. If not propaganda, Swanberg wrote, this reporting was at least “not very enterprising journalism.”</p>



<p><em>Science News Letter</em>’s eugenics reporting tapered off in the 1940s. This was around the time eugenics largely fell out of favor in the United States due to eugenics-inspired atrocities committed in Nazi Germany during World War II. &nbsp;There was however a slight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-future">uptick in coverage in <em>Science News Letter</em></a> in the 1960s, alongside a resurgence in eugenic ideas. (See <em>Science News</em>’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3111974">statement on its past coverage</a>.)</p>



<p>World War II brought other changes to Science Service. <em>Science News Letter </em>articles touted the ways that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/war-against-disease-won">science</a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/defense-work-speeded-new-way-making-parts">engineering</a> could aid the U.S. military. “Overshadowing almost everything else these critical days is the application of almost all our energies and our science to rescuing the world from forces of darkness,” Davis said in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-defense">a speech quoted in the magazine</a> in 1941. In a show of support for U.S. troops, Science Service began offering a pocket-sized, monthly edition of <em>Science News Letter</em> to service members. “This international edition,” boasted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/back-matter-1800">one 1943 advertisement</a>, “will contain only the scientific news of interest to the men and women overseas.”</p>



<p>In the lead-up to WWII, <em>Science News</em> had plenty of atomic physics coverage. For instance, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-energy-released">physicists succeeded in splitting the uranium atom</a> in 1939, it made the cover of <em>Science News Letter</em>. In the aftermath, the magazine published a slew of stories on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/two-more-elements-identified-splitting-uranium-atom">what elements tumbled out</a> when uranium cracked like a particulate piñata, on the prospects for using atomic energy as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gold-may-help-unleash-hidden-power-atom">fuel source or a weapon</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>But soon, government censorship and scientific self-censorship loomed over atomic physics. “It is very improbable that if significant advances are made in the release of atomic energy from uranium, details will be made public,” <em>Science News Letter</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/breakdown-cooperation-most-damaging-effect-war">predicted in 1940</a>. “It will become a military secret.” Lo and behold, by late 1942 the word <em>uranium</em> had all but vanished from the pages of <em>Science News Letter</em>. When one reader sent a letter to complain about the magazine’s recent dearth of physics coverage, Davis replied that although the magazine would “like to write more about uranium isotopes and atomic power … it is not possible to do this, because of the secrecy connected with our war effort.”</p>



<p>That all changed in August 1945, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and a government report on the Manhattan Project — the Smyth Report — came out.</p>



<p>“It is one of the amazing documents of all time,” Helen Davis, editor of <em>Chemistry </em>magazine, wrote in a letter. She was filling in for her husband Watson Davis at Science Service while he traveled. “We got two copies. One we kept intact, the other we pulled the staples out of, so we could work on parts of it all at once.” Helen Davis, along with Science Service reporters Marjorie Van de Water and Jane Stafford, spent days cranking out stories on various aspects of the report. In a letter to her husband, Helen wrote, “It is beyond all imagining. It is THE document of the age, and makes all physics and chemistry B.A.B. (Before Atom Bomb, of course) completely obsolete.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second World War may have ushered in a new era of science journalism as well. “Contemporary popular science is conventionally described as having been spurred on by World War II,” Cornell’s Lewenstein wrote in a 1994 article on the history of popular science in America. “Recognizing the role in winning the war <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">of the atomic bomb</a>, jet engines, radar, penicillin and a host of other scientific and technological achievements, the public ‘demanded’ more information about science and technology.”</p>



<p>Of course, many organizations were communicating to the public about science and technology, Lewenstein adds, including science museums and journalism organizations like Science Service. “Still, it is true that the United States had people and institutions ready to participate in new opportunities for public communication of science and technology after the war.” For starters, many newspapers at the time started doing more of their own science coverage.</p>



<p>In 1949, Ferry Colton, president of the National Association of Science Writers — founded in 1934 by a dozen reporters, including Science Service’s own Jane Stafford — hailed Science Service as a pioneer of science journalism. The scads of science writers now working for newspapers and magazines across the country were, Colton said, “the best possible testimony to the soundness of Mr. Scripps’ judgment in encouraging popular science writing.”</p>



<p>But that vindication was a double-edged sword. With more science writers on staff at other publications, there was less of a need for Science Service’s syndicated material. As a result, the organization ultimately phased out its syndication effort and instead focused on producing <em>Science News Letter</em>, which started going by <em>Science News</em> in 1966. “It is like being on a first name basis,” Watson Davis wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/editor">the editor’s note</a> that explained the title change, “which we like.”</p>



<p>In shedding its original role as a nationally syndicated news source, Science Service “doesn’t lose its legitimacy,” LaFollette says. “It retains its authority as an accurate, reliable source of news about the scientific community.” But the organization now had other priorities besides getting science into the headlines — it was getting science on the airwaves and into the hands of kids across the country.</p>

<p>So opened one episode of <em>Adventures in Science</em>, a CBS radio program that Davis hosted for two decades.</p>



<p>Science Service got in on the ground floor of commercial broadcasting and was involved in radio for nearly 40 years. In the 1920s, the organization started producing weekly radio science news scripts, which were mailed to dozens of stations across the country and read on the air by local announcers. By the early 1930s, Science Service was producing the weekly news program that would soon add interviews and would come to be known in 1938 as <em>Adventures in Science</em>.</p>

<p>“They were attempting to use radio to do something similar to what they were doing in print,” LaFollette says. That is, get the public excited about science. But promoting science on the radio came with new challenges. Science Service often had to fight to protect its trademark scientific rigor from network executives who put more stock in making science shows entertaining than accurate. For a few months in 1938, CBS seized full control over <em>Adventures in Science</em>, replacing Davis with CBS announcers as hosts. That setup led to “watered-down dramatizations” of scientific discoveries and short, “almost flippant” interviews with scientists, LaFollette wrote in her 2008 book <em>Science on the Air</em>. The new version of the show was so unpopular it lasted only a single summer — after which CBS handed the reins back to Davis, who kept <em>Adventures in Science </em>on the air until 1958.</p>



<p>Print and radio were far from Davis’ only tools for promoting science. “He was a tremendously creative guy,” Lewenstein says. And one of Davis’ most successful out-of-the-box ideas was Things of Science.</p>



<p>The Things of Science program mailed experiment kits in small boxes to children, schools and science clubs around the world. Every kit contained some scientific goody, such as a fingerprinting kit, flexible magnet or silkworm cocoon — including some Things of Science products that definitely wouldn’t fly today, like asbestos-containing fabrics. Each bit of paraphernalia came with a little placard to display the item. “In a short time,” promised <a href="http://ecg.mit.edu/george/tos/misc/flyer-1957.html">one 1957 flyer</a>, “you will build up an extensive and unique little science museum of your own.”</p>



<p>MIT signal processing researcher George Moody recalled saving a quarter each week for four months to buy his subscription as a child in the 1960s. “I suspect that many of us who chose careers in the sciences found at least part of our inspiration in those blue boxes,” Moody wrote in a <a href="http://ecg.mit.edu/george/tos/">blog post about an online Things of Science catalog he created</a>.</p>

<p>The Things of Science program launched in 1940 and ran for decades. Around the same time, Science Service undertook another major effort to encourage the next generation of scientists: The organization started hosting science competitions for science-minded kids around the country — and later the world. It all started in 1942 with the first annual Westinghouse Science Talent Search, now called the <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/">Regeneron Science Talent Search</a>, for high schoolers. In 1950, Science Service kicked off a second annual competition that has grown into the <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair</a>, which draws high school competitors from across the globe. And since 2010, middle schoolers have competed in the annual <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/broadcom-masters/">Broadcom MASTERS contest</a>.</p>



<p>Amid all these other ventures, Science Service continued mailing out copies of <em>Science News</em> — which also played a role in inspiring young minds. The magazine was a natural fit for student readers, says Barbara Culliton, who covered life sciences for <em>Science News</em> from 1966 to 1971. “There’s a lot of explanation of the mechanisms of how things work,” she says. “That is a formula that speaks particularly to people who want to learn something.”</p>



<p>Joseph Bates of Newton, Mass., remembers reading issues of <em>Science News</em> when he was growing up in the 1960s. “They gave me the sense of science as a search for truth,” he says. “You really had a feeling of the liveliness of scientific inquiry.” Watching the drama of science unfold in real time helped Bates envision himself as a scientist. Bates became a computer scientist, and in 1992, <em>Science News</em> covered his <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/wizard-oz">research on how to build lifelike characters in virtual reality</a>.</p>



<p>To help younger readers connect with the coverage, Science Service launched a second publication in 2003. The online magazine Science News for Kids — now <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/">Science News for Students</a> — covers a similar range of topics as <em>Science News</em>, but is written at a middle school reading level.</p>



<p>“Kids shouldn’t have to work to understand our stories. They should read them because they love them, and because it explains their universe,” says Janet Raloff, who started writing for <em>Science News</em> in 1977 and has helmed Science News for Students since 2007. “They’re just sponges trying to understand all this cool stuff.”</p>



<p>Andrea Distelhurst, a high school biology teacher in Bradenton, Fla., has used both Science News for Students and <em>Science News </em>with her students. “We try to impress upon them that science keeps changing over time,” Distelhurst says. <em>Science News </em>gives the teenagers a front-row seat to those changes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Calling all kids</h3>



<p>The online only <a href="http://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org">Science News for Students</a> covers stories similar to <em>Science News</em> but written at a middle-school reading level. After its launch in 2003 as Science News for Kids, the site published just one feature story and two short news items per week. And the news stories were always <em>Science News</em> articles rewritten for younger readers. But in the years since, the offerings have expanded to include more kid-friendly content, with stories on topics like adolescent health and gaming, as well as comics, explainers and guides for at-home science experiments. The goal, says Janet Raloff, editor of Science News for Students, is “to make sure we have something for everyone.”</p>

<h4>On the beat</h4>



<p>In 2011, <em>Science News</em> editor in chief Tom Siegfried assigned Raloff a herculean task. Over the next year, he wanted her to scour every past issue of <em>Science News</em> and compile a list of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plumbing-archives">most important stories from each decade</a> to commemorate the magazine’s 90th birthday.</p>



<p>Undaunted, Raloff started carrying bound volumes of old print magazines home from the office on weekends and vacations. “In a beach house, I was going through all these volumes, taking notes,” Raloff says. “My family thought I was crazy.” But Raloff rose to the challenge, reading more than 70,000 pages of <em>Science News</em> in a single year.</p>



<p>Her assessment? “We did very catholic coverage across all of the disciplines,” she says. But over time, different scientific fields took the spotlight.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, all eyes were on the space race. But earthly issues came to the fore in the following decades, as public concerns over the environment mounted. <em>Science News</em> covered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement that it was outlawing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/end-ddt-maybe">use of the harmful pesticide DDT</a> and the signing of the global Montreal Protocol to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ozone-accord-draws-praise-and-concern">phase out ozone-destroying chemicals</a>. In the 1990s, growing agreement among scientists about human-caused climate change shifted environmentalists’ focus toward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">cutting carbon emissions</a>. Amid a surge in molecular biology research, <em>Science News</em> explained how scientists become masters of manipulating DNA — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/126-unit-artificial-gene">creating synthetic genes</a> and accomplishing other feats of genetic engineering in the 1970s, and then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-sequenced-genome-bares-all">deciphering the human genetic instruction manual</a>, or genome, at the turn of the century.</p>



<p>Whatever the hot topic at any given time, <em>Science News</em> didn’t let other fields slip through the cracks, says Julie Miller, who covered life sciences for the magazine from 1976 to 1986 and returned as editor in chief from 1995 to 2007. “You have so many people enthusiastic about their own fields that there’s always some coverage across the board,” she says. Miller recalls an old journalism professor visiting her at <em>Science News</em> headquarters and noting, “It’s like you’ve got a little university here with just one person in each department.”</p>



<p>Joel Greenberg, editor in chief from 1981 to 1988, had a similar feeling about <em>Science News</em> staff. “The writers and editors were just so invested,” he says. “They just lived their beats.”</p>



<p>Perhaps no one embodied his beat more fully than Jonathan Eberhart, who covered space science and exploration for <em>Science News</em> from 1960 to 1991, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">the Apollo 11 moon landing</a>. Eberhart was such a dedicated reporter that he moved to Pasadena, Calif., for several months during the Viking mission to Mars so he could report new findings directly out of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>



<p>“He was so curious and so smart and had such great questions that they loved him and almost accepted him as a member of their team,” says Kendrick Frazier, who was the <em>Science News</em> editor in chief at the time. “That contributed to the quality of his articles.” Those articles won Eberhart the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Westinghouse Corporation’s joint science writing award in 1976.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> staff did on-the-ground reporting for other major scientific events, too. Thone, for instance, witnessed the nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. And Raloff visited the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant after its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/three-mile-accident">historic meltdown</a> in 1979.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> reporters also got many of their story ideas from scientific meetings. “The meetings we went to were where cutting-edge papers were presented,” Greenberg says, “so we’d get in on the ground floor on all of these new developments.”</p>



<p>Miller still vividly remembers one such meeting. It was a gathering of medical researchers in 1981 — just after the first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, had appeared in the United Sates. “The scientists there were running around, all upset about this cluster of diseases that were occurring in gay men, and they put together a symposium on the spot,” Miller says. “I came back and said we had to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-outbreak-serious-diseases-focuses-homosexual-men">write about this</a>.” As the AIDS outbreak became an epidemic, <em>Science News </em>followed the quest to develop tests and treatments.</p>



<p>There were “so many parallels to what’s going on now with the coronavirus,” Greenberg recalls, “including a guy we quoted a lot back then in the search for a cure for AIDS. A guy named Anthony Fauci.”</p>



<p>Some meetings offered <em>Science News</em> writers a brighter glimpse of the future. Ivars Peterson, who covered math, technology and other physical sciences from 1981 to 2007, recalls one particular gathering of physicists in the 1990s. “I saw this amazing thing called a Web browser,” he says. “I was blown away.” Other meetings granted Peterson access to more offbeat scientific curiosities — like a meeting of engineers who had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/lessons-learned-lady">given the Statue of Liberty a makeover</a> in the 1980s, which ended with a private tour of the renovated statue.</p>



<p>That mix of big, flashy findings and more obscure advances won <em>Science News</em> the 1987 George Polk Award for excellence in science reporting. In his nomination letter, <em>New York Times </em>science writer Malcolm Browne wrote, “I can’t imagine any significant development in science, however arcane the discipline, escaping the speedy notice of <em>Science News</em>.”</p>

<h4>All about the science</h4>



<p><em>Science News</em> staffers — past or present — often describe their readers as science buffs.</p>



<p>“We reported on increments that were much smaller than any newspaper or other publications,” Greenberg says. Naturally, that attracted readers who were “interested in every nook and cranny of science.” Some were scientists keeping up with the latest in other fields. Others were plain-old science enthusiasts.</p>



<p>“There is an eclectic mix in there,” says Raloff, who has received reader letters and phone calls from farmers, motorcycle mechanics and artists alike. But <em>Science News</em> readers have always been united by one common feature, she says: “People who just loved science and wanted to get their fix of what’s new this week.”</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> staffers have typically been science buffs themselves. And that has influenced the kinds of stories that the magazine tells. Historically, <em>Science News </em>has focused more on regaling readers with new discoveries, Lewenstein says, than, say, investigating the motivations of those who fund certain research projects.</p>



<p>John Travis agrees. He covered biology for <em>Science News</em> from 1995 to 2004 and is now the managing news editor at <em>Science</em>, an academic journal that also covers news in science. “At <em>Science</em>, we cover policy, we cover the community, we cover the failures and weaknesses of scientists,” he says. <em>Science News</em> has given those topics less attention.</p>



<p>Over the years, <em>Science News</em> has pondered some thorny ethical questions surrounding new science. When the first heart transplant was performed in 1967, for example, <em>Science News</em> covered surgeons’ concerns about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ethical-problems-reverberate">whether it was moral</a> to save one person’s life using a treatment that relied on someone else’s death. In 1975, the magazine covered a meeting about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/asilomar-decision-unprecedented-guidelines-gene-transplant-research">how genetic engineering could be regulated</a> to prevent scientists from spawning unnaturally dangerous bacteria in the lab.</p>



<p>But, historically, such stories have not been the main focus for <em>Science News</em>. “For better or for worse,” Travis says, “they focus on the curiosity and wonder of science more than the downsides of it or of the scientific community.”</p>



<p>There was good reason for <em>Science News</em>’ “very pro-science” attitude, Peterson says. “Science is a very useful way of looking at the world.” But that didn’t necessarily mean the magazine hailed every reported result as a breakthrough, he adds. “We were always very careful to put in what the scientists like to put in,” Peterson says, “which is the ‘maybe’s’ and the ‘with a high probability,’ to avoid overstating things.”</p>



<p>Travis remembers applying that skepticism when he covered the announcement that two research groups had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/dna-genetics-genome-code-medicine-diversity">completely mapped the human genome in 2000</a>. “I was so annoyed at the press conference,” Travis says now. The epic mapping project wasn’t actually finished. Neither group confirmed that its genetic sequence was free of gaps or errors — and in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-work-reaches-milestone">opener for his story</a>, Travis pulled no punches: “Biology’s hottest race has been declared an amicable tie,” he wrote, “even though one competitor has a clear lead and neither has actually reached the finish line or knows exactly what the prize contains.”</p>



<p>That sober perspective would probably have made Davis proud. While director of Science Service, Davis drafted a list of “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hints-for-writing-science">Stories That Should Be Handled with Care</a>,” from reports about the healing powers of hypnotism to long-range weather forecasts to “sweeping claims of any sort.”</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> hasn’t always perfectly applied that critical eye, as Raloff discovered in her 90-year review of the magazine’s coverage. “There’s a series of those things,” she says, “where you just look at them and you go, ‘Oh my god. How could we ever have covered that, just straight-faced without challenging it?’” Raloff was particularly shocked by a Cold War–era article about a proposal to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-dangers-overrated">excavate a new Panama Canal with nuclear explosives</a>. “We covered it like … ‘Isn’t that a clever idea?’” she says. “No! It’s a horrible idea! You’ve just gone through World War II. How could you think that’s a good idea?”</p>



<p>The problem with those kinds of stories, Raloff says, was often that writers reported on bold claims without including comments from other researchers in the field. Seeking comments from outside experts to provide perspective and criticism has now been standard practice at <em>Science News</em> for decades. “It’s kept us from having egg on our face, I think, in some of our contemporary coverage,” Raloff says.</p>



<p>Kevin Parker of Greenbelt, Md., who has been reading <em>Science News</em> since 1969, appreciates that approach. While other publications have “a tendency to do kind of the print version of clickbait,” he says, <em>Science News</em> stories usually “manage to keep an even temper.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The magazine has always put a premium on factual correctness in stories. “There was a lot of care taken to make sure things were accurate,” Peterson says. “It would screw up once in a while, but that was rare.” One 1985 article, for instance, reported the discovery of a lost city in Peru that was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/lost-and-found-city-peru-gets-new-perspective">not, in fact, lost at all</a>, but had previously appeared on maps and in guidebooks. <em>Science News</em> published a follow-up story acknowledging and correcting the error, just as an editor’s note appears on corrected stories today.</p>



<p>“Reporting without sensationalizing and getting things right,” Frazier says. That has always been and continues to be the <em>Science News</em> brand. “It’s a quality, reliable, respectable science news source.”</p>



<h4>Going digital and beyond</h4>



<p>A popular science magazine may have been a niche product when <em>Science News-Letter</em> got its start, but half a century later, <em>Science News</em> was far from the only game in town. The 1970s and 1980s brought a flurry of new science magazines. Many of those publications ultimately folded because they couldn’t sell enough ads, but <em>Science News</em> survived on the support of its subscribers.</p>



<p>“It seemed to have a really devoted following,” says Richard Monastersky, who covered earth sciences for <em>Science News</em> from 1986 to 2000. “The people who got us really loved us.” Hollywood icon and <em>Science News</em> subscriber Marlon Brando, for instance, sometimes called <em>Science News </em>reporters to discuss stories that piqued his interest.</p>



<p>Greenberg recalls meeting <em>Science News</em> readers from California after he had left the magazine in 1988 to become a science editor at the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. “I’d get on a plane, and there’d be somebody from JPL or Caltech, and they’d say, ‘What do you do?’ and I’d say, ‘I’m a science editor at the <em>LA Times</em>,’ and they’d … go back to reading or something. And then I’d say, ‘But I used to be the editor at <em>Science News</em>,’ and they would drop everything,” Greenberg says. “It was like I was a matinee idol or something. They’d just want to talk and talk … they couldn’t care less about any newspaper stuff, but they really were devoted to <em>Science News</em>.”</p>



<p>Such dedicated readers were the key to helping <em>Science News</em> thrive in the 1980s. But in the 1990s, <em>Science News</em> faced a whole new wave of competition online.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> launched its website in 1996, the same year that <em>Scientific American</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> went online. Each week, the <em>Science News</em> website posted short summaries of every story in the magazine and the full text of at least three articles. Raloff’s food science column “Food for Thought” and Peterson’s “MathLand” were among <em>Science News</em>’ first online-only content. But <em>Science News</em>’ print magazine was still the mainstay of the operation; the website was just a bonus.</p>



<p>Not every staff member was sold on the staying power of the internet. In her <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-news-year-13">final editor’s note of 1996</a>, Miller expressed her skepticism. “Will the Web evolve into the New Media, as Wall Street analysts proclaim, replacing television, newspapers, and other sources of information and entertainment?” she wrote. “Maybe, maybe not.”</p>



<p>“How could we have been so naive!” Miller says now. “We were about to get run over by this train, and we were thinking, ‘Maybe it will come, maybe it won’t.’”</p>



<p>Of course, as it did for everyone, the internet changed everything for <em>Science News</em>. “For the kinds of people who read <em>Science News</em>,” Lewenstein says, “suddenly, you don’t really need <em>Science News</em>.” Online readers had all kinds of publications to read for free, and scientists could speak directly to the public on their own websites.</p>



<p>When Siegfried became editor in chief of the magazine in 2007, his mission was to help <em>Science News</em> stay relevant in the digital age. “It was a recognition that online news was becoming a dominant force,” Siegfried says. “The online publication was a way to increase the timeliness, to reach out to more people and to … create general awareness of the magazine and try to boost circulation that way, too.”</p>



<p>To that end, <em>Science News</em> started posting news online every day and collecting the most important stories into a biweekly magazine. Going to print every two weeks, rather than weekly, allowed the newsroom to focus on more rapid online coverage and to produce a heftier magazine for each print issue, Siegfried says. “That was a big change in how things were done.”</p>



<p>By operating as a daily news outlet, <em>Science News</em> could jump on new discoveries faster. In 2012, <em>Science News</em> broke the discovery of the Higgs boson <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/cms-spokesman-weve-observed-new-particle">a day before scientists made their official announcement</a>, thanks to then-editor Kate Travis, who uncovered an announcement video accidentally posted early on CERN’s website. In 2019, <em>Science News</em> published a story about the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a> mere minutes after it was unveiled. That article drew over 1.5 million unique page views in a single day — a nice achievement for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/50-years-later-its-hard-say-who-named-black-holes">a publication believed to be the first to use the term “black hole”</a> in print, in 1964.</p>

</div><figcaption><em>Science News</em> posted this explainer video about black holes the same day scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope unveiled the first image of one of the cosmic beasts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite <em>Science News</em>’ growing online audience, print circulation was dwindling. “We were like all magazines or newspapers, in that we had survived on advertising and subscribers,” says Maya Ajmera, who became president and chief executive officer of the Society for Science and publisher of <em>Science News</em> in 2014. “That model completely changed.”</p>



<p>Ajmera sought new funding from private donors and foundations, and launched the <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/outreach-and-equity/science-news-in-high-schools/"><em>Science News</em> in High Schools program</a> to boost print readership. (<em>Science News </em>in High Schools provides educators at more than 5,000 schools print copies and online access to the magazine, along with other classroom materials.) Those changes have helped make <em>Science News</em> more financially sustainable, Ajmera says, with more than 21 million visitors to its main website in 2021. “I’m excited by the next century of <em>Science News</em>.”</p>



<h4>The century ahead</h4>



<p>Today, <em>Science News</em> is aggressively covering some of the biggest stories of our time, including rapid new developments in the COVID-19 pandemic and the global crisis of climate change. Reporters have their eyes on game-changing technologies across all fields, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-human-clinical-trials-top-science-stories-2019-yir">gene-editing tools</a> that could cure diseases to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-supremacy-claim-controversy-top-science-stories-2019-yir">quantum computers</a> that promise to perform feats of calculation impossible for normal computers. But, true to form, the magazine also serves up the lighter side of science, explaining <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-wombats-poop-cubes">why wombats have cubed poop</a> and what <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-circling-wormhole-weird-gravitational-waves">gravitational waves from a wormhole</a> might look like.</p>



<p>“I’d also love to see more stories that are dealing with the human condition,” Ajmera says. She points to reporting by social sciences writer Sujata Gupta, who has covered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias">research on police reform</a> and how the pandemic has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-worsened-gender-inequality-us-workforce">worsened some socioeconomic inequalities</a>. “How do we produce more stories that can really touch everyone’s lives?” Ajmera asks. “I think we can do more.”</p>



<p>Editor in chief Nancy Shute thinks so too. When Shute came to <em>Science News</em> in 2018, she says, “I thought it would be really important to expand our social sciences coverage to help people see how science could help them understand what’s happening to them and what’s happening to the world right now.” Part of that was bringing on Gupta to cover social sciences. But stories in other fields can elucidate people’s personal connections to science, too. Shute is especially proud of a series that Tina Hesman Saey took on before the COVID-19 pandemic. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-ancestry-dna">Genetic testing goes mainstream</a>” explored the uses and limitations of direct-to-consumer DNA testing for medical information and tracing ancestry.</p>



<p>“It was a great example of explanatory science journalism that people could really engage with, because it directly impacted their lives,” Shute says. “That’s a great example of the superb work that <em>Science News</em> can do.” In fact, the series won a 2019 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine Communications Award.</p>



<p>Shute also hopes to captivate more readers with new types of storytelling. For a century, the written word has been <em>Science News</em>’ bread and butter. But that form has its limitations. “Online journalism is a visual medium,” Shute says, “and it’s really important that we invest more in that.” She would like to produce more data visualizations akin to one that <em>Science News</em> developed last year to illustrate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">every cosmic collision</a> known to have kicked up gravitational waves.</p>



<p>“It was so creative,” Shute says. “Being able to do things like that, and give people another way to explore the science that’s scientifically accurate but also incredibly fun and can deliver surprises, is just a joy.”</p>



<p>That’s really what science journalism is all about, says Laura Helmuth, who interned at <em>Science News</em> in 1999 and is now editor in chief of <em>Scientific American</em>. “The fundamental goal [is] making the most important research accessible and engaging and entertaining and fun to read,” she says, which has been the purpose of <em>Science News</em> from the start. “I think that sticking with that principle has really been the reason it’s survived and thrived.”</p>



<p>In May 1921, just one month after Science Service was born, Ritter wrote a letter to his old pal Scripps. In it, Ritter expressed his optimism that Science Service’s journalism would meet an eager audience. “Unquestionably there are aspects of science that appeal strongly to popular interest,” he wrote. “There is much that is curiosity-satisfying, much that is practically useful, much that is dramatic.”</p>



<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century">last 100 years</a> have revolutionized scientists’ understanding of everything from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">architecture of the atom</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/space-galaxy-exoplanets-solar-system">the size of the universe</a>. Through it all, <em>Science News</em> has tried to shine light on as many corners of science as possible. It is, as Shute says, “everything you need to know about science, including things you didn’t know you wanted to know.”</p>

                <p>When I was hired as a summer intern at <em>Science News</em> in 2017, I was equal parts excited and anxious. I’d heard the job had a steep learning curve. But given that physics and astronomy writer Marcia Bartusiak, my graduate school mentor, had gotten her start as a <em>Science News</em> intern — and Marcia was pretty much everything I wanted to be when I grew up — I’d decided to brave the gig.</p>



<p>Though he retired shortly after I arrived, former <em>Science News</em> editor in chief <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tom-siegfried">Tom Siegfried</a> still occasionally appeared in the office during my internship. A few times, he edited my stories. During those edits and over lunch breaks, Tom proved to be a font of advice for the trainee science writer: Carry a notebook everywhere. Don’t overstuff a sentence with too many ideas. Don’t start stories with a question; it is a journalist’s job to <em>tell</em> readers something, not the other way around.</p>



<p>That advice served me well as an intern and later as a <em>Science News</em> staff reporter  — although I did recently break the no-questions rule <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ghost-forest-tree-farts-emissions-greenhouse-gases">to make a fart joke</a>. (Sorry, Tom.) And when I started researching <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3111938">the origins of <em>Science News</em></a> for my history of the magazine, I discovered that the publication has served as a training ground for science journalists from the very start.</p>

<p>When Edwin Slosson took charge of Science Service in 1921, science journalism was still a nascent field. So Slosson found himself editing a lot of newbie science writers. He, like Tom, “also dispensed advice, liberally, like salt over a bowl of popcorn,” <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/blog/science-service-close-tips-writers-–-running-starts-and-clean-plates">according to historian Marcel LaFollette</a>. In 1950, <em>Science News Letter</em> posthumously published <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hints-for-writing-science">some of Slosson’s science writing maxims</a>.</p>



<p>A few of Slosson’s tips were about hooking readers. A writer should always imagine, he said, “that your reader is interrupting you every ten lines to ask, ‘Why?’ ‘What for?’ or ‘Well, what of it?’” When it came to untangling complex scientific concepts, Slosson warned, “don’t overestimate the reader’s knowledge and don’t underestimate the reader’s intelligence.”</p>





<p>A few of Slosson’s pointers were a bit more arcane. “Don’t regurgitate undigested morsels,” he advised. “It is a disgusting habit.” Perhaps Slosson meant writers should not simply echo jargon used by scientists. Or that reporters should not repeat ideas without considering their validity and context. Either way, it’s certainly one piece of writing advice I’ve never forgotten.</p>



<p>In the decades since Slosson’s editorship, <em>Science News</em> has upheld his legacy of bringing up new science journalists. Barbara Culliton, a former editor at <em>Science </em>and <em>Nature</em> and former president of the U.S. National Association of Science Writers, cut her teeth at <em>Science News</em> in the 1960s. Being a cub reporter for the magazine was great, because she had “an opportunity right off the bat to start writing real stories and talking to real people,” Culliton says. “That was a great advantage in actually learning content, in meeting scientists, in getting to know other journalists. It was really the foundation that has built my career and a lot of others.”</p>



<p>Several current <em>Science News</em> staff members, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman">astronomy writer Lisa Grossman</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/laura-sanders">senior neuroscience writer Laura Sanders</a>, are former interns. Other internship alums have gone on to write for publications such as <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>BuzzFeed</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>. Laura Helmuth, editor in chief of <em>Scientific American</em>, interned at <em>Science News</em> in 1999.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“You aren’t treated like the intern. You’re treated like just another staff writer.” </p><cite>Laura Helmuth</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“You aren’t treated like the intern. You’re treated like just another staff writer,” Helmuth says. “It’s terrifying at first, but also very empowering.” Helmuth recalls how <em>Science News</em> staff helped her hone story ideas and connect with researchers. “The <em>Science News</em> internship was considered one of the very best for training you how to be a really good reporter and writer.”</p>



<p>The internship, which dates to at least the 1970s according to our records, is <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/jobs-and-internships/science-news-internship/">still something of a crash course</a> in science journalism. “It focuses on the nuts and bolts of science writing — getting the science right, while wrapping it in a story,” says news director Macon Morehouse, who mentors <em>Science News</em> interns. One big goal, she says, “is for interns to come out with a real facility, or at least improvement, in how they can handle the bread-and-butter science story.” That includes getting comfortable covering unfamiliar fields and turning around stories on tight deadlines.</p>



<p>“It was a really good learning experience,” says Jack Lee, who interned at <em>Science News</em> in 2020 and is now a communications fellow at the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Md. “Macon definitely gave advice where needed, but was also willing to let me try to figure it out on my own.” Lee recalls rewriting one story several times to meet <em>Science News</em>’ high standards. “That was a big turning point for me, because it was hard and probably the story that I’m most proud of, just because I stuck with it.”</p>



<p>Lee knew, coming into the <em>Science News</em> internship, that it was notoriously difficult. But he felt that if he could hack it at <em>Science News</em>, he could make it as a science writer anywhere. Learning how to manage edits, along with other skills like pitching stories and fact-checking, has served him well in freelance journalism, Lee says. “It opened a lot of doors.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/24/heres-how-our-ability-to-empathise-changes-as-we-get-older/">Here’s how our ability to empathise changes as we get older</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How does age affect our ability to empathise? Some researchers think that our ability to understand and respond to others’ feelings follows an inverted U-shaped pattern, with empathic skills peaking in middle age before declining again in older age. But as Michelle Kelly at the University of Newcastle and colleagues point out in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-15369-001">their paper</a> in <em>Neuropsychology</em>, findings in this field have been mixed. Their new work, on 231 adults aged 17-94, suggests that while people aged over 65 aren’t quite as good at &#8220;cognitive empathy&#8221; (working out what someone is likely to be feeling), they are just as good at &#8220;feeling with&#8221; others.</p>



<span id="more-45810"></span>



<p>The first two main tasks were designed to measure cognitive empathy. Participants were shown photos of faces and also videos of actors who’d been asked to convey various emotions. They had to identify the emotions being expressed, and decide whether pairs of images were showing matching or different emotions.</p>



<p>In a third task, they saw 19 images of people engaged in some kind of social encounter or activity. For each, they were asked questions related to cognitive empathy (e.g. what the main character was feeling); questions related to affective empathy (e.g. how affected they were by seeing the scene); and one question related to prosocial behaviour (whether they would do anything if they saw this happening in real life).</p>



<p>For the analysis, the team split the participants into three groups: young (aged 17-35), middle (aged 36-65) and older (66-94). They found no differences in scores on affective empathy or prosocial behaviour. Earlier research has certainly suggested that the two are linked — that our ability to &#8220;feel with&#8221; someone is what drives us to help them. (After all, psychopaths can score highly on cognitive empathy but completely fail to feel their victims’ fear or humiliation.)</p>



<p>However, the older group was slightly worse at cognitive empathy. And the team thinks that results from yet another task suggest a potential reason. In this task, the participants first read out, as quickly as possible, a list that included their name and another person’s name. But the rules changed in a second condition, so that whenever they <em>read</em> their own name, they had to <em>say</em> another name (and vice versa). They were then scored according to how much longer they took in the second condition, as well as how many more errors they made.</p>



<p>The team regarded these scores as a measure of participants’ ability to inhibit information relevant to their own self — and they found a link between poorer scores and poorer cognitive but not affective empathy. They think this supports the idea that people who aren’t as good at self-inhibition find it harder to work out what someone else is feeling. However, poorer scores on self-inhibition could also reflect general cognitive slowing, which might influence cognitive empathy as well.</p>



<p>One of the biggest limitations to the study (and it’s far from alone in this limitation) is that it compares groups of people of different ages, rather than following the same people as they age. One of the strengths is that it taps into &#8220;state&#8221; empathy — empathy experienced in the moment — rather than relying only on self-report questionnaires that ask people to rate how they typically respond.</p>



<p> “Clearly, the relationship between advancing age and empathic skills is complex,” note the researchers — and factors other than age affect how individual people respond to others. But the finding that older people are not less able to share in other people’s emotions — as has been suggested by some other studies — is a encouraging one.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-15369-001">Empathy across the ages: “I may be older but I’m still feeling it”.</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-bones-dinosaur-swim-paleontology">Spinosaurus’ dense bones fuel debate over whether some dinosaurs could swim</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fierce group of predatory dinosaurs may have done much of their hunting in the water.</p>



<p>An analysis of the bone density of several sharp-toothed spinosaurs suggests that several members of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04528-0">this dino group were predominantly aquatic</a>, researchers report March 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That finding is the latest salvo in an ongoing challenge to the prevailing view that all dinosaurs were land-based animals that left the realms of water and air to marine reptiles such as <em>Mosasaurus</em> and flying reptiles such as <em>Pteranodon</em>. But, other researchers say, it still doesn’t prove that <em>Spinosaurus</em> and its kin actually swam.</p>





<p>Back in 2014, Nizar Ibrahim, a vertebrate paleontologist now at the University of Portsmouth in England, and colleagues pieced together the fossil of a 15-meter-long <em>Spinosaurus</em> from what’s now Morocco. The dinosaur’s odd collection of features — a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lost-and-found-dinosaur-thrived-water">massive sail-like structure on its back, short and muscular legs, nostrils set well back from its snout</a> and needlelike teeth seemingly designed for snagging fish — suggested to the researchers that the predator might have been a swimmer (<em>SN: 9/11/14</em>). In particular, it had very dense leg bones, a feature of some aquatic creatures like manatees that need the bones for ballast to stay submerged.</p>



<p>In the new study, Ibrahim and his team returned to that question of bone density to assess whether it’s a reliable proxy for how much time a creature spends in the water. The team assembled “a massive dataset” of femur and dorsal rib bone densities from “an incredible menagerie of extinct and living animals, reaching out to museum curators all around the world,” Ibrahim says.</p>



<p>That menagerie includes spinosaurs like showy, sail-backed <em>Spinosaurus</em> as well as its equally sharp-toothed cousins <em>Baryonyx</em> and <em>Suchomimus</em>. It also includes other groups of dinosaurs, extinct marine reptiles, pterosaurs, birds, modern crocodiles and marine mammals.</p>



<p>The team then compared these bone analyses with the water-dwelling habits of the various creatures in the study. That work confirms that density is “an excellent indicator” for species in the early stages of a transition from land-dwelling to water-dwelling, the team reports. Those compact bones can aid such transitional creatures, which might not yet have features like fins or flippers to help them maneuver in the water more easily, in hunting underwater — what the team calls “subaqueous foraging.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analyses also show that not only did <em>Spinosaurus</em> have very dense bones, but <em>Baryonyx</em> did too. That suggests that both of these dinos were subaqueous foragers, the team says. That idea builds on previous work by Ibrahim and colleagues that proposed that <em>Spinosaurus</em> didn’t just spend much of its time in the water, but could actually swim in pursuit of prey, thanks to its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-dinosaur-fossil-tail-aquatic-swimmer">odd, paddle-shaped tail</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>).</p>

<p>The idea of a swimming <em>Spinosaurus</em> hasn’t been convincing to all. In 2021, a study in <em>Palaeontologia Electronica</em> examined <em>Spinosaurus</em>’ anatomy in detail and came to a different conclusion. The dinosaur <a href="https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2021/3219-the-ecology-of-spinosaurus">was not a highly specialized aquatic predator</a>, wrote David Hone, a zoologist and paleobiologist at Queen Mary University of London, and Thomas Holtz Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park. Instead, <em>Spinosaurus</em> may have just waded in the shallows, heronlike, to do its fishing.</p>



<p>The new study has not convinced those skeptics. <em>Spinosaurus</em> has “clearly got very dense bones. This is really good evidence that they’re hanging around in water — but we kind of knew that,” Hone says. “It’s not clear what they’re <em>doing</em> in the water. That’s the contentious part.”</p>



<p>Take hippos, which spend much of their time mostly submerged, Hone says. “Hippos have bone densities entirely comparable to <em>Spinosaurus</em> and <em>Baryonyx</em>, but they don’t eat in the water” and they don’t swim, he adds.</p>



<p>“Everyone has been in agreement that <em>Spinosaurus</em> was more aquatic than other big theropods” like <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, Holtz says. That <em>Baryonyx</em> also had dense bones was a bit of an interesting surprise, he adds.</p>



<p>But dense bones or not, Holtz says, “it still doesn’t turn them into aquatic hunters.” He describes several anatomical features — <em>Spinosaurus</em>’ long slender neck, tilted head and arrangement of neck muscles that suggest a downward striking motion — that point more to a wading creature that hunted from above the water surface than one that chased its prey underwater.</p>



<p>Kiersten Formoso, a vertebrate paleobiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, says that the new comparison of bone densities among a wide variety of creatures is a valuable addition, one that she anticipates referring to in her own work studying the transition of ancient creatures from land to water. But she too is not convinced that it proves that <em>Spinosaurus</em> and <em>Baryonyx</em> could actually swim.</p>



<p>“I would never detach <em>Spinosaurus</em> from the water,” Formoso says. But, she adds, more work needs to be done on its biomechanics — how it might have moved — to understand how adroitly aquatic the dinosaur might have been.</p>

Its thick disk — a pancake-shaped population of old stars — <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04496-5">originated remarkably soon after the Big Bang</a> and well before most of the stellar halo that envelops the galaxy’s disk, astronomers report March 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“We are now able to provide a very clear timeline of what happened in the earliest time of our Milky Way,” says astronomer Maosheng Xiang.</p>





<p>He and Hans-Walter Rix, both at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, studied almost 250,000 subgiants — stars that are growing larger and cooler after using up the hydrogen fuel at their centers. The temperatures and luminosities of these stars reveal their ages, letting the researchers track how different epochs in galactic history spawned stars with different chemical compositions and orbits around the Milky Way’s center.</p>



<p>“There’s just an incredible amount of information here,” says Rosemary Wyse, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. “We really want to understand how our galaxy came to be the way it is,” she says. “When were the chemical elements of which we are made created?”</p>



<p>Xiang and Rix discovered that the Milky Way’s thick disk got its start about 13 billion years ago. That’s just 800 million years after the universe’s birth. The thick disk, which measures 6,000 light-years from top to bottom in the sun’s vicinity, kept forming stars for a long time, until about 8 billion years ago.</p>



<p>During this period, the thick disk’s iron content shot up 30-fold as exploding stars enriched its star-forming gas, the team found. At the dawn of the thick disk era, a newborn star had only a tenth as much iron, relative to hydrogen, as the sun; by the end, 5 billion years later, a thick disk star was three times richer in iron than the sun.</p>



<p>Xiang and Rix also found a tight relation between a thick disk star’s age and iron content. This means gas was thoroughly mixed throughout the thick disk: As time went on, newborn stars inherited steadily higher amounts of iron, no matter whether the stars formed close to or far from the galactic center.</p>



<p>But that’s not all that was happening. As other researchers reported in 2018, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">another galaxy once hit our own</a>, giving the Milky Way most of the stars in its halo, which engulfs the disk (<em>SN: 11/1/18</em>). Halo stars have little iron.</p>



<p>The new work revises the date of this great galactic encounter: “We found that the merger happened 11 billion years ago,” Xiang says, a billion years earlier than thought. As the intruder’s gas crashed into the Milky Way’s gas, it triggered the creation of so many new stars that our galaxy’s star formation rate reached a record high 11 billion years ago.</p>



<p>The merger also splashed some thick disk stars up into the halo, which Xiang and Rix identified from the stars’ higher iron abundances. These “splash” stars, the researchers found, are at least 11 billion years old, confirming the date of the merger.</p>



<p>The thick disk ran out of gas 8 billion years ago and stopped making stars. Fresh gas around the Milky Way then settled into a thinner disk, which has given birth to stars ever since — including the 4.6-billion-year-old sun and most of its stellar neighbors. The thin disk is about 2,000 light-years thick in our part of the galaxy.</p>



<p>“The Milky Way has been quite quiet for the last 8 billion years,” Xiang says, experiencing no further encounters with big galaxies. That makes it different from most of its peers.</p>



<p>If the thick disk really existed 13 billion years ago, Xiang says, then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">the new James Webb Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>) may discern similar disks in galaxies 13 billion light-years from Earth — portraits of the Milky Way as a young galaxy.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The spread of the COVID-19 disease has prompted a need for immediate reaction
by governments to curb the pandemic. Many countries have adopted different
policies and studies are performed to understand the effect of each of the
policies on the growth rate of the infected cases. In this article, the data
about the policies taken by all countries at each date, and the effect of the
policies on the growth rate of the pandemic are used to build a model of the
pandemic's behavior. The model takes as input a set of policies and predicts
the growth rate of the pandemic. Then, a population-based multiobjective
optimization algorithm is developed, which uses the model to search through the
policy space and finds a set of policies that minimize the cost induced to the
society due to the policies and the growth rate of the pandemic. Because of the
complexity of the modeling problem and the uncertainty in measuring the growth
rate of the pandemic via the models, an ensemble learning algorithm is proposed
in this article to improve the performance of individual learning algorithms.
The ensemble consists of ten learning algorithms and a metamodel algorithm that
is built to predict the accuracy of each learning algorithm for a given data
record. The metamodel is a set of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms that
is used in the aggregation phase of the ensemble algorithm. Because there is
uncertainty in measuring the growth rate via the models, a landscape smoothing
operator is proposed in the optimization process, which aims at reducing
uncertainty. The algorithm is tested on open access data online and experiments
on the ensemble learning and the policy optimization algorithms are performed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-social-media-tiktok-telegram">Social media crackdowns during the war in Ukraine make the internet less global</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, people around the world have watched the war play out in jarring detail — at least, in countries with open access to social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and the messaging app Telegram.</p>



<p>“The way that social media has brought the war into the living rooms of people is quite astounding,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonJoan">Joan Donovan</a>, the research director&nbsp;of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. Fighting and explosions play out nearly in real time, and video messages from embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy have stirred support across the West.</p>



<p>But that’s not all. Social media is actually changing the way wars are fought today, says political scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/zeitzoff">Thomas Zeitzoff</a> of American University in Washington, D.C., who is an expert on political violence.</p>





<p>The platforms have become important places to recruit fighters, organize action, spread news and propaganda and — for social scientists — to gather data on conflicts as they unfold.</p>



<p>As social platforms have become more powerful, governments and politicians have stepped up efforts to use them — or ban them, as in Russia’s recent blocking of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. And in a first, the White House held a special briefing on the Ukraine war with TikTok stars such as 18-year-old Ellie Zeiler, who has more than 10 million followers. The administration hopes to shape the messages of young influencers who are already important sources of news and information for their audiences.</p>



<p>The Ukraine war is shining a spotlight on social media’s role as a political tool, says Donovan, whose <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/programs/technology-social-change/">Technology and Social Change Project</a> team has been <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/research-resources-russian-invasion-ukraine/">following the spread of disinformation</a> in the conflict. “This is a huge moment in internet history where we’re starting to see the power of these tech companies play out against the power of the state.” And that, she says, “is actually going to change the internet forever.”</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> interviewed Donovan and Zeitzoff about social media’s influence on the conflict and vice versa. The following conversations have been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: When did social media start to play a role in conflicts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zeitzoff</strong>: Some people would say the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, way back in the 1990s, because the Zapatistas used the internet [to spread their political message]. But I think the failed Green Revolution in Iran in 2007 and 2008 was one of the first, and especially the Arab Spring in the early 2010s. There was this idea that social media would be a “liberation technology” that allows people to hold truth to power.</p>



<p>But as the Arab Spring gave way to the Arab Winter [and its resurgence of authoritarianism], people started challenging that notion. Yes, it makes it easy to get a bunch of people out on the street [to protest], but it also makes it easier for governments to track these folks.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How do you see social media being used in the Ukrainian conflict, and what’s different now?</strong></p>

Social scientists are using open-source data to analyze the conflict as it unfolds and using social media to share information.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Donovan</strong>: Some of the platforms that are more well-known, like Facebook and Twitter, are not as consequential as newer platforms like Telegram and TikTok. For instance, Ukrainian groups on Facebook started to build other channels for communication right before the Russian invasion because they felt that Facebook might get compromised. So Telegram has been a very important space for getting information and sharing news.</p>



<p>Telegram has also become a hot zone for propaganda and misinformation, where newer tactics are emerging such as fake debunked videos. These are videos that look like they’re news debunks showing that Ukraine is participating in media manipulation efforts, but they’re actually manufactured by Russia to make Ukraine look bad.</p>



<p><strong>Zeitzoff</strong>: I think social media has probably afforded the Ukrainians an easier ability to communicate to their diaspora communities, whether in Canada, the United States or across Europe.&nbsp;It’s also increasingly affording unprecedented battlefield views.</p>



<p>But I think the bigger thing is to think about what these new suites of technology allow, like Volodymyr Zelenskyy holding live videos that basically allow him to show proof of life, and also put pressure on European leaders.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Despite Russia’s big investments in disinformation, is Ukraine winning the social media war?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zeitzoff</strong>: Up to the beginning of the conflict, many Ukrainians were skeptical of Zelenskyy’s ability to lead. But you look back at his presidential campaign, and he was doing Facebook videos where he would talk into the camera, in a very sort of intimate style of campaigning. So he knew how to use social media beforehand. And I think that has allowed Ukraine to communicate to Western audiences, basically, ‘give me money, give me weapons,’ and that has helped. There is an alternative scenario where perhaps if Russia’s military were slightly better organized and had a better social media campaign, it would become very difficult for Ukraine to hold.</p>



<p>And I would say that Russia’s propaganda has been sloppier. It’s not as good of a story. Ukraine already has the underdog sympathy, and they’ve been very good at capitalizing on it. They show their battlefield successes and highlight atrocities committed by Russians.</p>



<p>And the other thing is that social media has helped to organize foreign fighters and folks who have volunteered to go to Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Social media is also an enormous source of misinformation and disinformation. How is that playing out?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Donovan</strong>: We’re seeing recontextualized media [on TikTok and elsewhere], which is the reuse of content in a new context. And it usually also misrepresents the time and place of the content.</p>



<p>For instance, we’ve seen repurposed video game footage as if it was the war in Ukraine. While we [in the United States] don&#8217;t need real-time information to understand what&#8217;s happening in Ukraine, we do need access to the truth. Recontextualized media gets in the way of our right to truth.</p>



<p>And we want to make sure the information getting to people in Ukraine is as true and correct and vetted as possible, because they’re going to make a life-or-death decision that day about going out in search of food or trying to flee a certain area. So those people do need real-time accurate information.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s one other story about the way in which hope and morale can be decimated by disinformation. Among Ukrainians, there’s a lot of talk about when or if the United States or NATO will send planes. And there were these videos going around suggesting that the United States had already sent planes, and showing paratroopers jumping out. People were sharing these until they got to a reputable news source and heard the news that NATO was still not sending planes. So it can be something as innocent as a video that provides a massive amount of hope to people who share it, and then it&#8217;s all snatched away.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What aren’t we seeing on social media?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Donovan</strong>: There&#8217;s a missing piece, which is that many social media algorithms are set to remove things that are torturous or gory. And so the very violent and vicious aftermath of war is something that the platforms are suppressing, just by virtue of their design.</p>



<p>So in order to get a complete picture of what has happened in Ukraine, people are going to have to see those videos [from other news sources] and be a global witness to the atrocity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Where is this all heading?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zeitzoff</strong>: I think the biggest thing that’s changing is this decoupling of social media networks across great powers. So you have the Great Firewall [that censors the internet] in China, and I think Russia will be doing something very similar. And how does that influence the free flow of information?</p>



<p><strong>Donovan</strong>: We try to understand how information warfare plays out as kind of a chess match between different actors. And what&#8217;s been incredible about the situation in Russia is you have this immense titan, the tech industry, pushing back on Russia by removing state media from their platforms. And then Russia counters by removing Facebook and Instagram in Russia.</p>



<p>This is the first time that we’ve seen these companies take action based on the request of other governments. In particular, Nick Clegg [the president of global affairs at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp] said that they were complying with Ukrainian asks. That means that they are taking some responsibility for the content that is being aired on their platforms. Whatever outcome happens over the next month, I don&#8217;t think the internet is going to be as global as it once was.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rubble-asteroid-space-rock-levitate-sound-waves">Levitating plastic beads mimic the physics of spinning asteroids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some asteroids can barely hold it together.</p>



<p>Rather than solid lumps of rock, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-texture-instant-coffee">‘rubble pile’</a> asteroids are loose collections of material, which can split apart as they rotate (<em>SN: 3/16/20</em>). To understand the inner workings of such asteroids, one team of scientists turned to levitating plastic beads. The beads clump together, forming collections that can <a href="https://march.aps.org/sessions/K14/5">spin and break up</a>, physicist Melody Lim of the University of Chicago reported March 15 at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago.</p>



<p>It’s an elegant dance that mimics the physics of asteroid formation, which happens too slowly to observe in real-life space rocks. “These ‘tabletop asteroids’ compress phenomena that take place over kilometers [and] over hundreds of thousands of years to just centimeters and seconds in the lab,” Lim said. The <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/b8070K15S9013e0566653e78f934555243c707c65">results</a> are also reported in a paper accepted in <em>Physical Review X.</em></p>





<p>Lim and colleagues used sound waves to levitate the plastic beads, which arranged themselves into two-dimensional clumps. Acoustic forces attract the beads to one another, mimicking the gravitational attraction between bits of debris in space. Separate clumps then coalesced similarly to how asteroids are thought to glom onto one another to grow.</p>

<p>When the experimenters gave the structures a spin using the sound waves, the clumps changed shape above a certain speed, becoming elongated. That could help scientists understand why ‘rubble pile’ asteroids, can have odd structures, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroids-bennu-ryugu-strange-diamond-shapes">‘spinning tops’</a> formed by asteroids Bennu and Ryugu (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>).</p>



<p>Eventually, the fast-spinning clumps broke apart. This observation could help explain why asteroids are typically seen to spin up to a certain rate, but not beyond: Speed demons get split up.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Let’s say you’ve been found guilty of stealing a car. Would you prefer that a judge decided your punishment — or an algorithm?</p>



<p>Algorithms are increasingly taking over from people in making decisions in everything from the hiring of new employees to healthcare, as well as criminal punishment. But, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-29891-001">new pape</a>r in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General </em>note, there is mounting public concern about just <em>how</em> algorithms reach their decisions. In some US states, for example, companies that use algorithms in hiring are now obliged to explain the steps of the process.</p>



<p>However, “this emphasis on making algorithmic decision-making transparent, although well-motivated, raises a paradox,” argue Andrea Bonezzi at New York University and colleagues.</p>



<p>Judges, recruiters and doctors aren’t required to explain every decision. So why do we have such a problem with algorithms doing the same thing? The team thinks it&#8217;s because we misguidedly believe that we understand human decision-making better than algorithmic decision-making. In fact, they argue, human decision-makers “are often just as much of a black box as the algorithms that are meant to replace them”.</p>



<span id="more-45801"></span>



<p>To explore this, the team ran a series of studies. In the first, groups of online participants were asked to consider one of three scenarios in which either a human expert or an algorithm had to make a decision. One scenario involved evaluating the risk of a criminal defendant re-offending; another was about deciding whether an MRI scan revealed the presence of a disease; and the final concerned examining a video interview, to pick whom to hire. Participants then rated how well they understood the process that the human or algorithm would use to make their decision. In all scenarios, those who read about the human decision maker reported having a better understanding of this process than those who read about the algorithm.</p>



<p>But another group of participants was first asked to <em>explain</em> how a person, or an algorithm, would actually go about making these decisions. (This strategy is known to make people more realistic about what they actually do — and don’t — understand.) These participants gave lower &#8220;understanding&#8221; scores for the decision-making process of both the human expert and the algorithm — but there was a bigger impact on scores relating to the human expert, and in some cases this meant that the difference in scores for a person vs an algorithm vanished. “These results show that people foster a stronger illusion of understanding human than algorithmic decision-making,” the team concludes. </p>



<p>In a subsequent online experiment, some participants were told that it was easy for non-experts to evaluate a defendant’s risk of re-offending, and so to make a decision about whether or not to grant parole. This led them to have a greater &#8220;illusion of understanding&#8221; of the human expert’s process, but did not affect their reported understanding of the algorithm’s process. And this suggests that we think we &#8220;get&#8221; a human expert’s decision-making more because we project our understanding of our own decision-making process more onto other people than onto algorithms. This might not be surprising, but it helps to builds the team’s case. As do the results of a third experiment.</p>



<p>In this, when some participants were asked to reflect on what made them <em>different</em> to either a human radiologist or an algorithm, this led to lower &#8220;understanding&#8221; scores for the radiologist, but not the algorithm. The team argues that this shows that being forced to confront how different we are to a human expert disrupts our projection of our own decision-making processes onto them, making us less pro-human-biased.</p>



<p>There are other explanations, though, for why we are inclined to trust acknowledged human experts more than algorithms. The journey to becoming a judge, say, is highly competitive and takes many years. Such high-achievers might not be expected to reveal their decision-making process because, whatever exactly it entails, their career success implies that it’s sound. But it would be the same for an algorithm — data showing a solid track record of making good calls would alleviate concerns about its decision-making process, or about accepting its judgements.</p>



<p>Algorithms can “often out-perform” human decision-makers, the team argues. They conclude — and you might want to take a mental breath because it’s a long sentence, but one I think worth including in full: “Because the inner workings of modern algorithms are often inexplicable, holding inscrutable yet more accurate algorithms to transparency standards higher than those imposed on less accurate human counterparts that we delude ourselves to understand may ultimately be impractical and perhaps detrimental to social welfare.” Fair enough. But the qualifier &#8220;yet more accurate&#8221; is an important one. Providing clear evidence of this in relation to hiring, healthcare and punishment (as well as other fields in which algorithmic decisions affect people) would surely do more to convince a sceptical public to trust in algorithms.</p>
