<p><a href="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HIPAA-PR-Social-Image-1200x628.png"><img alt="HIPAA Compliance at Science Exchange" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1356" height="156" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HIPAA-PR-Social-Image-1200x628-300x156.png" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIPAA Compliance Demonstrates Commitment by Science Exchange to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protection and Privacy of Protected Health Information</span></i></p>
<p><b>PALO ALTO CA, June 7, 2018 –</b><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced that it is the first R&amp;D outsourcing platform to achieve HIPAA compliance as required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under 45 C.F.R. 164. This achievement demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by 45 CFR §160.103 and shared by its customers and scientific research providers on the Science Exchange platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Protecting sensitive patient health information is a top priority for our clients and research providers,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “Achieving HIPAA compliance was a crucial step for Science Exchange, given the increasing portability and complexity of data processed by our software platform.”  </span></p>
<p><b>HIPAA and HITECH: Noncompliance costing millions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act limit the disclosure of patient PHI, including data processed by any provider, technology platform, or other contractor. Since 2010, enforcement of HIPAA and HITECH has increased — with individual fines for noncompliance as high as $2 million. HIPAA compliance helps protect Science Exchange’s clients from these potential consequences.</span></p>
<p><b>Science Exchange achieved HIPAA compliance by:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing Business Associate Agreements for proper use and disclosure of PHI: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Associate Agreements are required agreements between covered entities and their business associates, such as Science Exchange, whose activities involve access to PHI</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards against improper disclosures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training every employee on protecting information subject to HIPAA and HIPAA requirements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting best practices for limiting information use and sharing</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Industry leaders in data privacy, security, and quality assurance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being the only HIPAA-compliant R&amp;D outsourcing platform, Science Exchange is also the only outsourcing platform to have earned EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification. This certification ensures compliance with the <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/gdpr-plan">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations</a> that went into effect on May 25, 2018, thereby protecting the many R&amp;D organizations that have enterprise-level agreements with Science Exchange. Science Exchange is also SOC 2-compliant and ISO 9001-certified.</span></p>

<p>"Swedish consortium Bibams’s recent cancellation of its contract with Elsevier is the latest in a series of high-value “publish and read” negotiations to make the news. It follows other examples such as Germany’s Projekt DEAL (also affecting Elsevier) and France’s Le Consortium Couperin (affecting Springer Nature). These multi-million dollar (or Euro or Kroner) negotiations have in common the advocacy of increased OA adoption. So we thought we would take a look at what effects they might have on the market place if the consortia negotiators have their way and cancellations became commonplace. Background and Common Drivers Negotiations undertaken by the Netherlands’ VSNU consortium from 2014 are now seen as a game changer for national consortia deals. Some aspects of the deals are familiar – such as enterprise-style licensing, multi-year contracts, and specified price rises, but there are some features which suggest a shift in balance of power in favor of the buyers..."</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550638442/0/oupblogpsychology/">Safe and supportive schools for LGBTQ-GNC students</a></h4>

<p>Within its first month, the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines designed to promote protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or gender non-conforming youth (LGBTQ-GNC) public school students. This move received significant media attention, much of which focused on the challenges of growing up LGBTQ-GNC, and the unique role of schools as places that should be safe and supportive for all students. At issue is defining the rights of students to be protected based on LGBT-GNC identity or status. And yet these rights are regularly compromised through: harassment and victimization that is unchecked; unfair, punitive, and exclusionary discipline practices; and unequal access to supports, services, and curriculum that validate their identities and experiences.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking study, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uslgbt/toc.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Hatred in the Hallways</em></a><em>, </em>documented pervasive human rights violations perpetrated against LGBT youth in US schools. More recently, through an international convening and report, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) firmly documented homophobic and transphobic violence as a global issue that has critical implications for positive development, health, and academic success of children and adolescence. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~en.unesco.org/themes/school-violence-and-bullying/homophobic-transphobic-violence" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UNESCO report</a> argued that bullying generally, and bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) specifically, comprise a threat to the universal right to education established in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. This groundbreaking report provided a comprehensive review of the international literature on SOGI-related bullying in schools and documented the disproportionate rates of bullying for LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries on every continent across the globe.</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote">
<p>While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people.</p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>Although the landscape regarding human rights affordances, constraints, and abuses related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is constantly in flux, any discussion of the SOGI rights of young people must take into account this larger global context. The rights of LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries where the expression of same-sex sexuality is criminalized are virtually non-existent; further, human rights violations against LGBTQ-GNC youth occur within most countries across the globe and are often justified by cultural and social norms and conventions regarding “acceptable or normal” definitions of sexuality and gender. While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people. While several advances have been made in the last decade to advance the rights of LGBTQ-GNC people across the globe (for example see the 2006 Yogykarta Principles and the 2011 Human Rights Council’s resolution on LGBTQ-GNC rights) these documents rarely attend to specific SOGI rights of <em>young people</em> or put forth any particular considerations regarding children and youth (a notable exception is in relation to access to education).</p>
<p>Understanding intersecting forms of oppression—such as the ways that structural oppression related to gender and sexuality and its intersections with race, ethnicity, class, and religion affect young people, their parents, and educators in schools—is essential for designing and implementing effective processes, strategies, programs, and advocacy aimed at creating positive change within school contexts. Many of the SOGI-related inequities evidenced in schools can be traced, in part, to narrow definitions of masculinity and femininity, rigid frameworks regarding gender and gender roles, and hegemonic structures in schools that mark heterosexuality as not only compulsory but also the sole valid expression of sexuality. Other forms of structural oppression rooted in racism, religious, or social class bias, are intertwined with SOGI issues in schools through inequitable discipline practices, religious control of public education, or economic disparities across schools.</p>
<p>Because SOGI issues in schools are embedded within larger systems of oppression, it is critical that research, practice, and policy engage with social justice and anti-oppressive education frameworks. Such approaches bring to the fore the ways that power, privilege, and bias structure schools in ways that tacitly sanction a range of educational inequities such as bullying, access to resources and services, and safety for young people in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. As we continue to do this work, it has become increasingly evident that the SOGI safe schools movement is “inextricably linked” to broader education justice concerns. It is critical for the safe schools movement to work with others through intersectional, multi-issue coalitions—at the nexus of research, policy and practice—to ensure that all students’ educational rights, regardless of social position, are upheld. This type of cross-issue organizing, advocacy, and research takes time and needs to be grounded in the principals of the worth and dignity of all people, and that ensuring the rights of specific groups expands the rights of everyone.</p>

<p>Understanding OA Ebook Usage: Toward a Common Framework</p>

<p>"...The authors of this proposal intend to convene a structured community conversation around usage tracking for OA ebooks. This conversation would focus on the challenges of identifying and aggregating relevant information from different platforms, analyzing what has been gathered in ways that respect user privacy, and communicating relevant information about usage to stakeholders (including authors, their publishers, their parent institutions, and their funders). As well as looking at strictly quantitative information (such as COUNTER-compliant usage data) we will explore more qualitative “story-telling” indicators, such as the altmetrics which are being collected by providers such as Altmetric.com, Plum Analytics, and CrossRef. Altmetrics are indicators of online engagement derived from tracking identifiable mentions of a particular publication in a variety of digital venues including social media platforms, mainstream and niche news publications, syllabi, and policy documents....</p>

<p>Schedule of Major Activities</p>

<p>The proposal is structured as a three-part engagement that would (a) identify the challenges in understanding the usage of OA ebooks and recommend a strategy for resolving them (research component); (b) refine these recommendations and create buy-in through a consultation exercise, conducted via online survey and an invited workshop (consultation component); and (c) publish a white paper including a framework for further action (dissemination component).</p>

<p>The research component would be led by Curtin University associate professor Lucy Montgomery of KU Research. The KU Research team includes Lucy Montgomery, professor Cameron Neylon, and associate professor Nic Suzor. Together, the members of this team have been doing important work to investigate issues of OA visibility, discovery and use of open access scholarly books; as well as the strategies and principles needed to support effective governance and mobilization of community data resources....</p>

<p>Suzor (Queensland University of Technology) is examining questions of data governance and management, to identify a route toward “data trusts.” The concept of a data trust builds on the observation that data relating to the uses of scholarly works is held by many different stakeholders within the scholarly communication system. Individual libraries, open access repositories, journals, indexing services, and aggregators each have access to some data about how scholarly resources are being used. Each of these stakeholders also possesses different internal technical capacities. Comprehensive and reliable approaches to measuring the uses of OA books requires shared protocols and understanding for data management, exchange, and access.</p>

<p>We will investigate how the needs of various stakeholders can be best reconciled in building a “data trust” or shared data commons, with clear rules for participation and access to data. We will work with participants to identify specific requirements and a road-map for the development of consensus-based protocols that address these needs. Ultimately, the successful development of a sustainable data trust will require a set of access and interchange protocols that protect sensitive information while ensuring that new participants have a strong incentive to provide access to the data they hold in exchange for access to aggregated benchmarking and longitudinal, geographic, and sector-specific insights.</p>

<p>The three purposes of this consultancy by KU Research would be to produce two documents (a landscape survey and an “action plan provocation” – also sometimes referred to as a “straw man”) ..."</p>

<p>Google English: "Textbooks at zero cost</p>

<p>A growing number of institutions are using open access, high quality and open licensed educational materials, commonly known as Open Educational Resources (OER). These educational materials may include modules, textbooks, videos, software and other tools, materials and techniques used to support access to knowledge. Zero Textbook Cost Courses (ZTC) is one of the Open Educational Resources initiatives to improve teaching, learning and accessibility for all students.</p>

<p>For years, everyone, from teachers to states, universities and foundations, have published free textbooks, but now some schools are taking a step further: they are redesigning their undergraduate programs so that students do not have to buy a single textbook They are not the first to notice the fall in non-fiction sales; people are turning more to digital resources such as training websites, YouTube and OER (open educational resources).</p>

<p>"Open educational resources" means high quality teaching, learning and research resources that are in the public domain or that have been released in accordance with an intellectual property license that allows their free use and reuse by others, and may include other resources that are legally available and free to students. Open educational resources include, but are not limited to, complete courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, content created by faculty, real-time videos, tests, software and any other tools, materials or techniques used to support access to knowledge.</p>

<p>In this way, College of the Canyons (COC), a community college in California, obtained a grant to launch its first Zero Textbook Program Cost Technical Assistance Contract Program that will soon offer more professional technical education programs or to eliminate the cost of commercial textbooks through the use of open educational resources. The program is endowed with 5 million dollars.</p>

<p>The California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office created the Zero Textbook Cost Degree program after conducting studies on the rising costs of education and its impact on student attendance and course selection. At the COC, 75 percent of students stated that the cost of books and supplies are the main barrier to achieving their educational goals. The university also found that 70 percent of students said that the cost of textbooks and supplies influenced their enrollment options and 67 percent of students said they were concerned that their grades would suffer if they did not buy books. of text.</p>

<p>"The preliminary program for the 10th Conference on Open Access Scholarly Publishing (COASP), hosted by the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association, OASPA, is now available here. The conference will be held at the University of Vienna on 17-19th September, 2018. Registrations for the conference are available via our Registrations and Accommodation page. As in previous years we are offering a discount on registration fees to OASPA and OAPEN members. This year, we are also extending the discount on COASP registration fees for academics and librarians at the member rate. Now in its 10th anniversary year, COASP is a major annual scholarly publishing conference that brings the open access community together to discuss new developments and innovations in scholarly publishing, and unite in our shared goal to enable research around the world to be openly accessible. In this important celebratory year for COASP, we will be kicking off the conference with an ‘Early Movers’ panel, in which key actors from the early years of the open access movement – Vitek Tracz, David Prosser, Susan Murray, Marin Dacos, Leslie Chan, and Caroline Sutton – discuss the history of the movement and the great progress in open access publishing that has been made since COASP held its first conference in 2008, and reflect on where open access publishing is heading today. Panel topics this year are: F.A.I.R. Research Outputs; Open Access Monographs; Transformative Agreements; and New Models in Open Access Publishing. As always, we will host a broad range of interdisciplinary global perspectives on other panels and in keynotes, and offer a large number of networking opportunities for further discussion and collaboration between attendees. We welcome delegates from a wide range of backgrounds at all stages of their careers who are working in publishing, librarianship, government, higher education, funding agencies, nonprofits, and other affiliated industries. Two networking receptions for delegates will be held on the evenings of Monday 17th and Tuesday 18th September. The conference is being discussed on social media with the hashtag #COASP10. Enquiries regarding the conference should be directed to coasp@oaspa.org. For highlights from last year’s conference in Lisbon, please see our video on YouTube. "</p>

<p>"When the sun shines outside, you probably need a double good reason to come indoors, switch on your machine and join a webinar. Well, on June 6th I’m not giving you a double good reason, I’m giving you the one and only reason you will want to connect to the internet: Robin DeRosa! Yabadabadoo! Open for the Public: Pedagogies Towards the Commons In this presentation, Robin will talk about her journey into open, and explore how open pedagogies can transform assignments, courses, programs, institutions, and even the technologies we use to communicate. She will highlight a couple of successful projects she worked on with students, and share examples from OPN, a new sharing site for educators and students who are trying out open practices. She will leave plenty of time for Q&amp;A to talk with participants about their own work, challenges and pitfalls related to working in the open, and current debates in the open community. Robin DeRosa’s research and advocacy work focus on Open Education, and how universities can innovate in order to bring down costs for students, increase interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration, and rebuild the case for public funding of higher education. She is a professor at Plymouth State University, part of the University System of New Hampshire, where she directs the Interdisciplinary Studies program. This webinar took place on Wednesday June 6th at 14.00 BST. The recording is available on GO-GN’s YouTube channel."</p>

<p>"In fall 2017, California officially joined the College Promise campaign when Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill waiving first year tuition for all new, CA resident students who enroll full-time at one of the 114 California Community Colleges (CCC). Even though the CCC full-time tuition is already one of the lowest in the country at approximately $1100 per year (2), this tuition waiver is a great start to assist students in attending college and to support them in going full-time. However, it’s important to note that, especially in CA, community college tuition is just a small fraction of overall expenses for students. According to a February 2018 report by The Institute for College Access &amp; Success, “Existing state aid programs are not designed to sufficiently address non-tuition costs of college, including housing, food, textbooks, and transportation, particularly in high-cost areas of the state.” [1] In fact, the CA Student Aid Commission estimates “students incur over $19,000 in non-tuition college costs per year for students living independently off campus (which the majority do)” [2]. Textbooks and supplies account, on average, for $1420 per year at public community colleges in the U.S. [4], more than CCC tuition. Part of the College Promise is to assist students in finishing programs they start. For many students, the cost of textbooks delays or eliminates students’ completion. This is especially true for community college students who I’ve taught and championed for almost 30 years. In 2014, StudentPIRG released a report of over 2000 U.S. higher ed students in which almost two-thirds of them claimed that they did not buy at least one required textbook because of the cost [4]. Of those students, 94% were worried about the lack of the textbook affecting their grades. In addition, almost half of the students agreed that “the cost of textbooks impacted how many/which classes they took each semester.” How can faculty, administrators and foundations support these students? Specifically, what can I do that supports the College Promise goals? For me, the cost of textbooks has become a social justice issue, one that I can actually do something about. I strongly believe that replacing expensive textbooks with OER is an equity and social justice issue. All students need free access to course materials on Day 1 of class, not when they can afford to purchase their textbooks. In 2006, my co-author and colleague, Susan Dean, decided our self-published “Collaborative Statistics” textbook would become one of the first complete Open Education Resource (OER) textbooks, one that is Creative Commons Attribution licensed, meaning that it is free and adaptable for anyone to use, so long as attribution is given In statistics and many college courses, if a student cannot purchase the textbook until the second or third week of the term, that student is at a severe disadvantage compared to student who start the term fully resourced. Rice University’s Connexions converted our hard copy text into an accessible online text, thanks to generous grants from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Maxfield Foundation. The textbook and publishing process went on to become the prototype for OpenStax textbooks. Just this one open textbook, now renamed “Introductory Statistics,” has saved students at our college over $3,000,000 in textbook costs over the past ten years. That’s multiples more than the foundations invested in it as well as more than we could ever provide for in textbook scholarships. Overall, OpenStax and other open textbooks have saved students hundreds of millions of dollars. Community colleges in CA and across the nation are developing zero-textbook cost degrees with the assistance of the Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resourcesand generous foundations. Free textbooks and free tuition –that’s how College Promise and using OER work together to increase student completion, close the achievement gap, serve our student, and build our next generation of leaders!"</p>

<p>"The challenge of redesigning public services is a difficult one. Local authorities recognise the need to deliver improved services across multiple channels, yet they are having to do more against the backdrop of budget cuts and austerity. In an attempt to answer this problem, four councils have turned to open data to redesign key public services in order to improve the lives of local residents, offering them targeted help, advice and opportunities. The projects, funded by Innovate UK through the Open Data Institute (ODI), were run by Doncaster Council, Kent County Council, the London Borough of Waltham Forest and North Lanarkshire Council, worked on tackling fuel poverty, increasing visitor numbers at cultural centres, helping young people make better career and education choices and reducing Freedom of Information requests. The work forms part of a three-year innovation programme being run by the ODI which aims to build data infrastructure, stimulate data innovation and build trust in the use of data. As part of the project, the ODI awarded funding to collaborations between four local government organisations and external partners to redesign a public service with open data, making it more efficient and citizen focused. The four projects are as follows, along with the lessons learned during the project: Doncaster Council and Uscreates Doncaster Council teamed up with Uscreates to explore the careers information, advice and guidance services available to young people aged 11 to 18 across the borough. The team used data from across Doncaster – as well as speaking to learners and careers advisors – to create a tool that helps young people access comprehensive information about their options for training, education and employment. David Ayre, Head of Strategy &amp; Performance at Doncaster Council said: “We felt that by developing a tool that made sense of the overwhelming amount of information available, we were not only investing in the students of today but also the future. The use of open data has enabled us to be able to provide a careers advice tool which gives students the confidence and information to go ahead and make positive, informed choices about their future.” The Social Mobility Opportunity Area Board in Doncaster has now signed off £100k of funding to develop a functional prototype over the next 6 months with the intention that it is ready to go live in January 2019...."</p>

<p>"The Council of the European Union will adopt conclusions on the European Open Science Cloud , one of the eight ambitions identified by the European Commission in it Open Science agenda. LERU takes this opportunity to present its new advice paper on Open Science and the necessary cultural change for universities -and other stakeholders- to embrace it. Open Science aims to improve productivity and efficiency, transparency and response to the needs in interdisciplinary research. With this, it works on research, education and research, opening up new paths across the globe. LERU universities are convinced that Open Science brings new opportunities for the scholar community and promotes the interaction between the academics and society. In addition, the transition to the new system will not be direct since there are some challenges lying ahead. For this process to be successful, involved organizations need a cultural change to implement the principles, policies and practices of open science. To guide universities in this transition, LERU published Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change, a report led by Paul Ayris, chair of the LERU Information and Open Access policy group, and Ignasi Labastiada, member of the same group and head of the Office for Knowledge Dissemination and the Research Unit at CRAI of the University of Barcelona, who participated as co-author. The paper discusses the eight pillars of Open Science, identified by the European Commission: the future of scholarly publishing, FAIR data, the European Open Science Cloud, education and skills, rewards and incentives, next-generation metrics, research integrity, and citizen science. Moreover, it analyses the introduction of open science at a university level in each one of these theme areas, and it identifies potential benefits and challenges. Among the measures it recommends universities to take in each of these areas, the document highlights the need to set a broader supportive environment and productive interactions with external stakeholders. It also provides with recommendations at an institutional level and a set of questions the universities can use to measure their progress in implementing Open Science approaches institutionally. “What we need now is for every institution to analyze the report and propose how to introduce the recommendations”, says Labastida. “Each institution –he continues- has a different starting point and one has to prioritize areas in which they want to start working on”. “In the UB –he says- we are doing well regarding open access. However, there is still a lot to do regarding research data management or assessment issues”. LERU universities are aware that adding open science means there will be a complex and multidimensional transition process, which will be different for each university. The 41 recommendations from the LERU report are not representing a prioritization of topics, nor a list of actions for the universities to take. These recommendations, and the report as a whole, are thought as a roadmap to accompany the efforts made by the universities regarding open science, which leaves space to each institution to make their own path, strategy and actions.

<p>"The European Commission proposed a new PSI Directive, that describes when and how publicly held data can be re-used by anyone (aka open government data). The proposal contains several highly interesting elements: it extends the scope to public undertakings (utilities and transport mostly) and research data, it limits the ways in which government can charge for data, introduces a high value data list which must be freely and openly available, mandates API’s, and makes de-facto exclusive arrangements transparent. It also calls for delegated powers for the EC to change practical details of the Directive in future, which opens interesting possibilities. In the coming months (years) it remains to be seen what the Member States and the European Parliament will do to weaken or strengthen this proposal. Changes in the PSI Directive announced On 25 April, the European Commission announced new measures to stimulate the European data economy, said to be building on the GDPR, as well as detailing the European framework for the free flow of non-personal data. The EC announced new guidelines for the sharing of scientific data, and for how businesses exchange data. It announced an action plan that increases safeguards on personal data related to health care and seeks to stimulate European cooperation on using this data. The EC also proposes to change the PSI Directive which governs the re-use of public sector information, commonly known as Open Government Data. In previous months the PSI Directive was evaluated (see an evaluation report here, in which my colleague Marc and I were involved). This post takes a closer look at what the EC proposes for the PSI Directive. (I did the same thing when the last version was published in 2013) This is of course a first proposal from the EC, and it may significantly change as a result of discussions with Member States and the European Parliament, before it becomes finalised and enters into law. Taking a look at the proposed new directive is of interest to see what’s new, what from an open data perspective is missing, and to see where debate with Member States is most likely. The bullets indicate the more interesting changes...."</p>

<p>"At last week’s Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR), organised by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, many delegates asked for educational materials to be made copyright free.  This was presented as a solution to several learning and development goals. Whilst the goals are noble (and shared by publishers and authors) their suggested solution won’t work. Here’s why. Those now seeking to exclude education from copyright need to answer the following question. When the world has finished reading for free all of the books and journals that exist today, who will pay for the production, curation and dissemination of the books and journals of tomorrow? Copyright and learning As they do so, they should look to the world’s first Copyright Act called an “Act for the Encouragement of Learning”. Those who wrote it knew that to achieve this Policy goal, books can only be accessed if they have first been produced. They needed a way of guaranteeing both. They knew that whilst many people write and publish for love not money, it is essential to the book needs of society and students that writers and publishers can earn a living from these pursuits. It is both fair and in the public interest that those who work in these professions get paid. Because Copyright was created to encourage learning, it has never been a monopoly. It has many mechanisms, rules and principles that facilitate access such as term limits, first sale doctrine, originality thresholds, collective licensing schemes and exceptions. Quality content Education is rightly a focus of many of these exceptions. But the global thirst for education that drives the call for wider and sometimes blanket copyright exceptions is exactly why the call for them must be resisted. In short, if Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education for all) is to be achieved, those making copyright and other related policies (open access) must ensure there continues to be a mechanism for politically free and long term sustainable investment in educational and research materials.  Why? Because high quality education and research needs high quality content. High quality content costs money to produce. Carving this content out of copyright will remove the main source of that funding. If copyright is now prevented from meeting these costs, who will? Who pays? The State? Do we trust our political leaders to maintain long term taxation and spending policies that put book and journal production on a sustainable footing? Do we also trust them to guarantee that educational materials published by the state will cover all subjects and views? Philanthropy? Are there enough philanthropists to step in? What motives and agenda will they have? What editorial control would they demand? And what happens when their funds or interest dries up? Corporate sponsorship? Ditto. Book awards and reading schemes the world over already struggle to attract sponsorship. Access Publishers are not “anti-access”. Providing access is in their DNA. They believe in a world made and shaped by words. They believe in high quality education and that books should live in minds not on shelves. They love what digital now enables readers to do with content. That is why I disagree with those who say that two worlds collided at #sccr36 last week. What I saw was one world coming together, impatient to realise a shared vision for a better planet inspired by better learning and wanting to find a way to make that happen. History says we won’t sustainably achieve that vision or Sustainable Development Goal 4 without good educational books and journals. And we know that whilst technologies, politicians and companies come and go, the ultimate guarantor of such books and journals to date has been copyright. Working together  There are no short term answers to long term problems. And no solid foundations that can be built overnight. Copyright’s role in encouraging learning has stood the test of time. Let’s work together to make it not break it. The UK is both home to many of the world's leading Universities and is also the world's leading exporter of books. It therefore has both the imperative and an obligation to play a leading role. We know that It is our job at the PA, along with our international partners at the IPO, IPA, FEP and IFFRO among others, to facilitate this.

<p>Google English: "Data: the new gold and the future is federated</p>

<p>In order to really benefit from the enormous growth of data in science and business, data must be shared. The solution is federated, with knowledge institutions bundling their research data, it technology and expertise. In this way we as a small country can counterbalance the monopolisation of big data by it-giants like Google.</p>

<p>We live in an era in which the volume of data exponentially grows and where computing power and storage capacity seem to be no restrictions. This is visible in data-intensive fields such as astronomy, where people work on the transition from Petabyte systems to Exabytes, and in sciences such as psychology or economics where datasets now contain several terabytes. The rapid development of data processing and analysis constantly leads to new scientific insights.</p>

<p>But major scientific discoveries and disruptive business innovations based on large-scale data have yet to come. This requires not only a lot of data, but also data from different sources, such as medical data, economic data and climate data. Combining data from multiple sources requires strong processing of the individual datasets so that they fit together...."</p>

<p>Google English: "How to increase the visibility of our research work</p>

<p>One goal of everyone who publishes is to increase the visibility of their work, which will make them more used and cited, thus increasing the influence and impact of our research.</p>

<p>Evaluating the impact of the research result is a key activity in funding and employment applications, academic promotion, as well as improving the reputation of a researcher within the academic communities.</p>

<p>The steps to increase visibility could be summarized in the following:</p>

<p>Create and maintain an author profile that brings together all our publications, which allows other specialists to find our jobs quickly. We have tools like ORCID, Scopus Author ID, ResearchID and Google Scholar profile. Thanks to these we will solve the problem of the ambiguity of the author's name, we make sure that our publications are attributed to us correctly, which in turn increases the accessibility and visibility of our work.</p>

<p>Publish in Open Access and deposit our works in repositories.</p>

<p>Promote our research in social networks such as blog, LinkediN and Twitter to communicate with the local and international audience (academics and media, etc.).</p>

<p>Participate in academic social networks such as Mendeley, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, etc. These networks, in addition to showing our profile and publications, allow us to create a network with other researchers with the same interests and participate in an academic conversation. They also provide download statistics and quotations of our publications on the platform.</p>

<p>Identify with complementary metrics the scope and visibility of their work, that is, who has shared, discussed and cited our work. This gives us a better view of our audience."</p>

<p>"”Enter once, reuse often” describes the goals of Open Researcher Identifier – to be linkable, global and transparent. To gain improvements for researchers, ORCID among other persistent identifiers need better infrastructure and wider implementation in the research process, including research funding application and reporting. These issues were discussed in Nordics ORCID workshop on May 29th, 2018. ORCID – the Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier – has now been around for six years. ORCID identifier links research information (employments, research fundings, works) to person’s identity globally and transparently. University of Helsinki started ORCID implementation in 2014 and was one of the founding members of the National Finnish ORCID Consortium in 2016. Currently some 3 400 researchers at the University of Helsinki have added their ORCID iD to University’s research database. Starting December 2016, researchers have been able to  synchronize selection of their research information from the research database to ORCID. Some 2 800 researchers have opted to do so (guide is available here). ORCID practices and ongoing projects related to identifiers and research funding were discussed in Nordics ORCID workshop on May 29th, 2018.  This is my report from the workshop and how some of the topics relate to work done at the University of Helsinki and nationally:..."</p>

<p>"The conception of an open future with scholarly publications being freely accessible, sharable, and reusable cannot be easily subsumed under a single term. That is, it can. But the term has conflicting objectives. The reasoning behind Open Access interests is diverse with two essential concepts being ‘research advancement’ and ‘economic benefit’. This article clusters stakeholders regarding their Open Access interest and reasoning, leading to the clusters a Open Access as a threat, b a pain, c the ideal Open Access, and d the exploitative Open Access. </p>

<p>A Blueprint for a Range of New Products</p>

<p>Technically, Open Access has a clear goal. There should be no barriers for potential readers—anyone—to access a publication for free online. There is a bit of a dissonance on what precisely that means, which platforms are suitable, whether there is sufficient work undertaken for archiving open online material, and not to forget the various modes OA can have, from green to gold, platinum, or brown. Technically, however, Open Access here means: free for the reader.</p>

<p>However, the initial initiative behind Open Access had more in mind than just the reader (Chan et al., 2002; Herb, 2017); it was about opening up scholarly communication. The plan was not to create a blueprint for a range of new products, but to revolutionise scholarly publishing. There are many reasons why the Open Access revolution (partly) failed (Poynder, 2017; Kingsley, 2016; Ward, 2014)—inertia in research processes, budget constraints, the wariness of some stakeholders, and the capitalistic boldness of others, to name but a few. Scholarly communication still is in a power struggle (Paasi, 2015), and Open Access even risks creating new knowledge regimes (Chan, 2017). This is no news, but it’s crucial to separate the Open Accesses lest Open Access becomes a useless term that is used by too many stakeholders for too different reasons...."</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/05/acupuncture-and-pain/">Acupuncture and Pain</a></h4>

<p>Acupuncture is one of the oldest systems of traditional medicine. With roots in China, this medical system is more than 2000 years old. It differs from various other medical systems as it does not involve taking any herbs or substances. Instead, it involves inserting small needles at specific predefined points. From the 20<sup>th</sup> century onwards, it has continued to gain prominence in the Western world, although many remain skeptical about efficacy.</p>
<p>These days, researchers want to know the exact mechanism of action of any medical system. They only trust the therapy if it has been proven as effective in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Acupuncture has been the subject of many such trials, and its usefulness has been established in certain pain-associated conditions, mood disorders, and even in some diseases of internal organs. This led to the recognition of this medical system by many healthcare providers and medical organizations. In the US, acupuncture is recognized as complementary medicine. The WHO also recommends it for a number of specific medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical evidence of efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of clinical trials provide evidence of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/21/the-science-of-acupuncture/">the effectiveness of acupuncture</a> in various medical conditions. Among the most relevant trials are the so-called German mega-trials named ARC, ART, COMP, and GERAC. The primary focus of these trials has been pain relief in various musculoskeletal conditions. GERAC and ART were high quality random clinical trials investigating low back pain. These trials compared real acupuncture with sham acupuncture and standard care. Sham acupuncture involved needling without the use of conventional acupuncture points. Whereas standard care included the use of physiotherapy, exercise therapy, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Results were measured after three months, and the response was defined as adequate if there was an improvement of more than 33% on the pain scale (the Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale). After 6-months, the response rate with real acupuncture was 47.6%, while it was 44.2% with sham acupuncture, and 27.4% with standard care. Though these trials clearly demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture, they also showed <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/29/there-is-no-sham-in-acupuncture/">the effectiveness of sham acupuncture</a>. Researchers think that this phenomenon is linked to psychogenic factors involved with back pain.</p>
<p>Interestingly, similar results were also demonstrated in various trials in the US. Though these trials show the usefulness of acupuncture in painful conditions, they also illustrate the value of psychogenic factors. Therefore, it is not surprising that acupuncture had also proven its utility in treating mood disorders and sleep disorders.</p>
<p>In Chinese medicine, the use of acupuncture is not limited to pain-related conditions. Thus, there is need for more extensive trials across a diverse range of diseases. The existing data do indicate that acupuncture may be an alternative approach for many difficult to treat chronic ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Possible mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>One of the areas of debate regarding acupuncture has been the difficulty in explaining its mechanism of action. As per traditional explanation, acupuncture is used to correct the flow of energy (Qi) in the body. This life energy flows through the fixed paths or highways in our body called <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/02/03/a-primer-on-acupuncture/">meridians</a>. Practitioners of acupuncture believe that in disease conditions there is a blockade of energy highways or meridians. Acupuncture is about creating the balance between the internal forces called Yin and Yang. However, the trouble is that modern science is not able to demonstrate or even understand the concepts of Qi, Yin, Yang, and Meridians.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, practitioners of modern science have made various attempts to explain the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and they came up with multiple theories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measurable effects of acupuncture</strong>: One of the explanations is that needling does cause local changes and alterations in reflexes. It also has systemic effects, as it changes the working of the autonomous nervous system. Thus, acupuncture affects blood pressure, heart rate, levels of various hormones, and changes the levels of neurotransmitters. All of this results in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/">pain relief</a> and other beneficial effects.</li>
<li><strong>Local mechanotransduction</strong>: This is a theory promoted by a French physician in 1961, who wrote that acupuncture points have lower local resistance when compared to surrounding skin. He wrote that while normal dry skin has a resistance of 200,000 to 2 million Ohms, acupuncture points have a resistance of just 50,000 Ohms. The believers in this theory say that acupuncture causes minute traumas at the points of needle insertion and thus stimulates survival mechanisms of the body. Needling stimulates homeostasis, anti-inflammatory responses, tissue regeneration, and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Neurohumoral theory</strong>: it has been demonstrated that acupuncture is useful in pain relief, and naloxone blocks its analgesic effect. Thus, researchers propose that needling at specific points leads to the release of endogenous painkilling <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/">opiate-like substances</a> such as enkephalins, endorphins, dynorphins and some other neurotransmitters like serotonin and noradrenaline.</li>
<li><strong>Gate-control theory</strong>: This theory states that needling stimulates large myelinated nerve fibers. These fibers carry tingling sensations and feelings of warmth, and can inhibit the painful sensation that is transmitted to the brain by much smaller C-fibers via spinal tracts.</li>
<li><strong>Postsynaptic inhibition</strong>: This is another explanation, which states that acupuncture results in the inhibition of pain through a central mechanism via disinhibition of RAF. This phenomenon typically works in cases of extreme trauma like loss of limb. This central mechanism has a role in protecting the body from extreme stress and pain.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous nervous system</strong>: Proponents of this theory suggest that acupuncture works by changing the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.</li>
<li><strong>Morphogenetic singularity theory</strong>: This is one of the more complicated hypotheses that tries to explain the existence of meridians. Advocates of this theory explain the presence of non-neural communication pathways in the body. During embryonic development, when neurons are not yet formed, cells must communicate among themselves to direct development. Meridians are just the remains of these early communication paths, which are still present in the adult body.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong>: In recent years, fMRI methods have advanced a lot, and in many clinical studies it has been demonstrated that stimulation of various acupuncture points by needling results in activation of different brain centers, thus explaining the mechanism of action of acupuncture. It is believed that both the elements of morphogenetic singularity theory (meridians) and components of the neurohumoral response are involved in the stimulation of the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is obvious that various theories have been used to describe the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and most probably there is more than one mechanism is involved. Clinical trials do seem to indicate that acupuncture is beneficial in specific health conditions. But the way it works still remains a mystery.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/HI-034040-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We now know that it is something in the farming environment that makes the salmon there have many spots, but we have yet to find out exactly how the spots are triggered. It could be anything from the lighting regime, temperature, diet, to the fish density or growth rate.</p>
<p>We investigated whether a specific breed of domesticated salmon had different numbers of spots depending on whether it had been hatched in a river or lived on a salmon farm its entire life.</p>
<p>We planted domesticated salmon into the Guddal river, Norway, where it hatched and stayed for 2-4 years before we took the salmon out of the river as smolts (juveniles) and moved it to our research station at Matre. After spending two years in land based tanks there, these salmon were still seven times less spotty than domesticated salmon that had lived its entire life at Matre under standard farming conditions, even though the salmon were the same breed.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10234" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-10234" height="302" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig-spots-1024x483.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Photographed by Monica F Solberg and edited by Katarina Jørgensen</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Both domesticated and wild salmon growing up in a farm environment had many spots, while all the salmon, both domesticated and wild, that were reared in the river had few spots. This means that we can be certain that it’s the environment that decides how many spots a salmon gets.</p>
<p>However, we also identified a region on salmon chromosome, a quantitative trait locus (QTL), containing genes linked to the degree of spottiness. So, genetics does play a role, but it is small compared to the effect of the environment.</p>
<p>Both the wild salmon and the domesticated salmon from the Guddal river had few spots even though these salmon lived for two years in land based tanks at the research station at Matre. This indicates that the spots were established on the salmon before it was removed from the river at smolting. That the salmon receive their distinguishing marks before they have time to escape is a useful observation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many spots are nevertheless a safe indicator of an escaped farmed salmon if you catch one in a river.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cleaning rivers of escaped farmed salmon currently happens based on visible traits such as <a href="http://lakselva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Salmopedia-h%C3%A5ndbok.pdf">body shape, the wear of fins and spots</a>. If farmed salmon survive for long in nature, they start to resemble wild salmon. Spots on salmon have been shown in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfb.13491">several studies</a> to be stable over time, so they probably don’t disappear upon escaping, although this is not what we have tested here. Many spots are nevertheless a safe indicator of an escaped farmed salmon if you catch one in a river.</p>
<p>Recently, experiments in Zebrafish show that when their stripes are disrupted experimentally they grow back in a way that is consistent with Alan Turing’s <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5999/1616">theory of how biological patterns form</a>. Turing patterns are known for allowing the environment to influence the pattern in ways which create individuality in each one – <a href="https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4682-8-24">like in human fingerprints</a>. Finding environmentally determined patterns in a well characterized species like Atlantic salmon points to new opportunities for studying biological pattern formation.</p>
<p>Individuality of patterns together with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfb.13491">spot stability over time</a> also suggests that spot patterns could be used for identifying individual fish using video surveillance, which may be used to monitor the environment in both fish farms and rivers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific research is challenging enough. But for Dr. Mareb Hamed, geopolitical upheaval in her home country of Iraq threatened not only her research, but also her survival.<a href="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Flag-map_of_Iraq.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-1349 alignright" height="300" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Flag-map_of_Iraq-300x300.png" width="300" /></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hamed’s story, and how Science Exchange became a part of that story, inspires our team to keep doing what we do — helping scientists connect.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;">Studying Growth-Restricted Fetuses in War-Torn Iraq</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mareb Hamed graduated at the top of her class from the Medical University in Mosul, Iraq, a city which was, at its peak, a cultural and educational center. In the 1990s, the political situation worsened under the regime of Saddam Hussein, and Dr. Hamed and her husband left Iraq and moved to Libya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When war started in Libya, Dr. Hamed returned to Iraq but could not re-obtain her former position of assistant professor, much to her frustration.“So I enrolled in the PhD program,” she explained, “in order to advance my career and because I liked research.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hamed began her research project in 2014, investigating the effect of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on placental biomarkers. IUGR can be caused by multiple factors and is a leading cause of neonatal deaths. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;">From Researcher to Refugee</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hamed had collected a number of placenta samples from local hospitals when the Arabs entered Mosul, killing or forcing the departure of countless scientists, engineers, doctors, lawyers, journalists, and other professionals.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I became a refugee in Erbil city,” recounted Dr. Hamed. “I lost everything. My house, my car..even the placenta samples that I was collecting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I knew I had to complete my PhD — I knew I had to start over and complete my research. So I continued my research at the University of Erbil, renting a small condo so that I could start working.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;">Erbil to St. Louis: Science Exchange Opens Gateway to Collaboration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of Kurdistan in Erbil, Dr. Hamed started collecting placentas again, and she was able to complete the histology and the immunohistochemistry on these samples. But the remaining analysis, which required electron microscopy, proved very difficult and cost-prohibitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started searching on the internet,” she continued, “and I found Science Exchange, and through Science Exchange, a provider who could do the microscopy for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hamed started sending her placenta capsule samples through DHL to the provider, an academic core laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis. The provider lab did the sectioning and the staining, and started sending Dr. Hamed the images by email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The microscopy images they sent me were very nice,” said Dr. Hamed. “Even during the defense of my thesis, I was told, “You have very nice pictures.”  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #338dc8;">The Surprise, and the Legacy</span><a href="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mareb-Acknowledgment.png"><img alt="Mareb Acknowledgment" class="size-medium wp-image-1351 alignright" height="262" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mareb-Acknowledgment-300x262.png" width="300" /></a></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I got a surprise,” said Dr. Hamed, “and I am very grateful to Washington University for this. When I told the lab my story, about how I was a refugee from Mosul, and how they had taken everything, they performed the service without requiring any payment. They did not take even one dollar from me! Only I have paid the cost of sending the samples by DHL.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hamed successfully defended her thesis, in which she acknowledged Science Exchange and her collaborators in St. Louis. She has since gone on to continue her research in Mosul and also provide medical assistance and training to other dislocated and disadvantaged Iraqis — showing that the power of scientific connections goes far beyond an electron microscope.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/20180531_150109-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>More than 2500 Palliative Care researchers and clinicians traveled to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Bern to attend <a href="http://www.eapcnet.eu/research2018/">EAPC2018</a>. With a stunning view of the Swiss Alps, the congress commenced with a musical interlude by members of the youthful local string ensemble <a href="http://www.cellobass.ch/Cellobass/PRJOJEKT.html">CELLOBASS</a>, followed by a welcome from the President of the Swiss Science Foundation, and the Mayor of the City of Bern.</p>
<p><strong>Time for celebration!</strong></p>
<p>This year’s congress was marked by a double celebration, namely the 30th anniversary of the European Association for Palliative Care, as well as the commemoration of the 100th birthday of <a href="https://cicelysaundersinternational.org/dame-cicely-saunders/">Dame Cicely Saunders</a>, widely regarded as the founder of palliative care as we know it today.</p>
<p>Cicely trained as a nurse, social worker and physician, dedicating her work to pain and symptom relief through holistic care that not only addresses the physical needs of patients, but also meets the social, psychosocial and spiritual needs of patients, family and carers. She was involved in the foundation and running of the world’s first purpose-build hospice St. Christopher’s Hospice in London, as well as the <a href="https://cicelysaundersinternational.org/">Cicely Saunders Institute</a>, a charitable organisation which promotes research to improve care and treatment for all patients with progressive illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Hot topics in palliative (s)care research</strong></p>
<p>The conference was broadly divided into three major topics: cancer and palliative care, public health and policy, and ageing and palliative care. Furthermore, the first day saw a special Swiss session, which discussed controversial topics such as the wish to die and hastening of death, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and continuous deep sedation, as well as topics on palliative care services in Switzerland and beyond.</p>
<p>Free standing sessions were also held, addressing various topics including family carers, palliative care in diverse chronic illnesses, advance care planning, education research, and research methods discussions. However, two themes emerged in talks across all sections: 1. the increasing requirements of palliative care needs worldwide, and 2. the recommendation to integrate palliative care alongside clinical care.</p>
<blockquote><p>The term palliative care has become an unspeakable metaphor for one’s own death.</p></blockquote>
<p>The latter topic was addressed in two talks by the winner of this year’s Clinical Impact Award <a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/thomas-william-leblanc-md">Thomas LeBlanc MD</a>, who discussed his own work on integrating palliative care in the clinical treatment of patients suffering from haemato-oncological diseases. His slip of the tongue “Palliative Scare” was an unintended example of how the service is often feared by medical professionals and patients as an end-of-the-line treatment. This thought was also emphasized by Early Researcher Award winner <a href="http://www.thegroundswellproject.com/anna-collins/">Anna Collins</a>, who stated that the term palliative care has become an unspeakable metaphor for one’s own death, and discussed the communication between patients and doctors about death, dying and the introduction of palliative care.</p>
<p>These and other discussions at EAPC2018 indicated that integrating palliative care in the treatment of terminal (cancer) patients at an earlier stage helps relieve unaddressed symptoms, lessens psychosocial distress, and improves overall quality of life and death.</p>
<p><strong>Palliative care for the many and the few</strong></p>
<p>Several talks at EAPC2018 addressed the specialist palliative care needs and requirements for minority groups. The variety in minority groups resulted in diverse topics discussing different aspects and needs of palliative care, including the spiritual needs of religious people in secular countries, and the cultural and linguistic barriers between carers and patients of different ethnicity.</p>
<p>Children form another minority group in palliative care, and their specialized needs can sometimes be overlooked by palliative care researchers and carers. In an excellent talk by Post Doctoral Award winner <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/our-staff/lorna-fraser/">Lorna Fraser</a>, various data sets were linked to provide a better insight in the access to palliative care for children and young adults with progressive or terminal disease.</p>
<p>My personal favorite was an insightful talk by Mary Turner on palliative care for dying prisoners, and in particular the difficulties faced by prison officers responsible for their care. The shortage of palliative carers in UK prisons means that most palliative support is provided by prison officers who are not trained to deal with the psychological aftermath of caring for the terminally ill. Furthermore, the facilities in UK prisons often do not allow for the installments of hospital beds, wheelchairs may not fit through doors, and palliative care resources are lacking. The lack of time, resources, and training relating to palliative care for dying inmates contributes to the general stress and job-related ill health of prison officers across the UK, and a poor quality of life for dying inmates. An open meeting to discuss a taskforce for care provision for prisoners in Europe was also part of the EAPC2018 program.</p>
<p><strong>Personal reflections</strong></p>

<p>EAPC2018 was a very interesting conference that covered a wide range of thought-provoking, and sometimes controversial topics, and I would certainly recommend this congress to anyone with interest in the field. I would like to congratulate <em><a href="https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Palliative Care</a> </em>Associate Editor <a href="https://research4kids.ucalgary.ca/profiles/shane-sinclair">Shane Sinclair</a> for receiving the Paper of the Year Award, and I would like to commend the organisers for handing out sturdy, reusable plastic cups, which greatly reduced the amount of plastic waste that I have experienced at other conferences. I am certainly looking forward to the 11th World Research Congress of the EAPC in Palermo, Italy!</p>

<p><em>This is an excerpt from the Introduction to <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Over the last decade writing about brain science, I’ve developed a tried and tested method for researching an unfamiliar topic.</p>
<p>First, I’ll read the appropriate chapter in <em>Principles of Neural Science,</em> the neuro-bible beloved by brain geeks the world over.</p>
<p>Then I’ll run a quick search on PubMed, an online search engine of biomedical literature, to find a recent review of the topic, typically written by a top scientist in the particular field, which will give me a feel for the topic’s controversies and consensus.</p>
<p>Then I’ll feel confident enough to read and understand original research papers.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll seek out the experts themselves – the scientists, doctors and specialists, who, despite their busy schedules, usually give generously of their time to answer my questions and fill in the gaps of my knowledge.</p>
<p>However, describing the neurobiology of women’s everyday lives hasn’t always been as straightforward as I expected when I began writing my book.</p>
<p>My meander through the world of women’s health often left me bewildered. Time and time again I’d open the textbooks or scan the literature to find scant research on some of the questions I’d been most curious about.</p>
<p>For example, I assumed the literature would be replete with information on how the oral contraceptive pill affects women’s brains. A 2014 review summed up the current state of affairs with the title <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>50 Years of Hormonal Contraception. Time to Find Out What It Does to the Brain</em></a>. Quite.</p>
<p>I proudly announced to Facebook the day I finally dived into the neurobiology of multiple orgasms. But it was not a deep dive. PubMed spat out only five literature reviews, three of which were devoted to the possibility of multiple orgasms in men. One was amusingly titled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2050052115000542" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Multiple Orgasms in Men. What We Know So Far</em></a>. (FYI: Orgasms don’t rate a mention in neuroscience textbooks and we don’t know much so far about women’s orgasm either).</p>
<p>Despite my best efforts, I was unable to pin down the statistics for how many women suffer emotional turmoil in the days leading up to their period, aka premenstrual syndrome (PMS). I eventually narrowed the range down to somewhere between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972521/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">twelve </a>per cent and ninety per cent.</p>
<p>I was positive I’d be able to tell my mid-life readers whether or HRT would help protect against dementia or clear away their brain fog. Oestrogen protects the ageing brain, but we simply don’t have enough information about the benefits for brain health for any recommendations to be made.</p>
<h2>Why is the literature so sparse when it comes to neurobiology and women’s health?</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Historically, preclinical research (research conducted on lab animals such as rats, mice or monkeys) has mostly been conducted on male animals. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008499/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2009 survey</a> of over 2000 animal studies found a significant male bias in eight out of ten biological disciplines. The bias was most pronounced in the field of neuroscience where five and a half males were studied for every one female. Worryingly, pharmacology (the study of drugs) shares similar statistics, with five males studied to every one female.</p>
<p>Clinical research (investigations conducted on humans) hasn’t fared much better. There are a few large, all-female projects such as the Women’s Health Study which I’ll discuss in later chapters, but for many years women were excluded from clinical studies and drug trials altogether. As <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714546/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one critic notes</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Many medical professionals can attest to the fact that for decades, the default human model subject was a 70-kg male.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is alarming because diagnoses for anxiety and depression are more than twice as common in women than in men, women have more strokes than men, twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis, and women have a higher susceptibility to adverse drug reactions compared with men. Indeed, between 1997 and 2000, eight out of ten drugs withdrawn from the USA market were, in part, due to more severe adverse effects in women.</p>
<p>The cumulative effect of excluding women from research studies, or assuming that biologically women are ‘little men’, is destructive. As has been pointed out in the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20535186" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Nature</em></a>, medical care as it is currently applied to women is less evidence-based or ‘robust’ than that being applied to men.</p>
<p>You’d be tempted to believe the straightforward sexism permeates the hallowed halls and ivory towers as readily as other global institutions. It does, but sexism isn’t the only reason for lack of gender equality. There are some legitimate reasons to skew the ratios.</p>
<p>One reason is safety because if women fall pregnant during a drug trial there is the potential for harming the unborn baby.</p>
<p>Another reason is that females – both animals and humans – complicate data gathering. Our cyclical reproductive hormones, especially during the fertile years between puberty and menopause, make our biology intrinsically more fickle than males.</p>
<blockquote><p>The menstrual cycle was once<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cahill+L+2017++an+issue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> likened</a> to “a pesky sort of feature essentially of the female, an unnecessary source of additional variability and one wisest to avoid.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To further complicate matters, in humans, biological sex (anatomy and physiology) and gender (characteristics that a society or culture defines as masculine or feminine) are tightly entwined and hard to tease apart. It’s extraordinarily difficult to make statements such as, ‘It’s due to her hormones’, or ‘It’s all to do with cultural expectations’. Rather than tackle the intricacies of female sex and gender, female hormones and culture, researchers often choose the easier route of focussing on males.</p>
<p>Finally, research on sex and gender has been for a long time been almost taboo. This is especially so in the neurosciences where many researchers were deeply concerned that their findings could be hijacked to support outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and discrimination.</p>
<p>The fears are not unfounded. Women’s brains have historically been found wanting or biologically inferior compared to males, and such <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-neurosexism-is-holding-back-gender-equality-and-science-itself-67597" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research</a> has been co-opted to “keep women in their place”.</p>
<p>One neuroscientist <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cahill+L+2017++an+issue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that</p>
<blockquote><p>…exploring sex differences was once “a terrific way for a brain scientist not studying reproductive functions to lose credibility at best and, at worst, become a pariah in the eyes of the neuroscience mainstream.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I spoke to another who said she once believed including sex as a biological variable was ‘lazy’. This was before she came to the conclusion that studying the impact of a woman’s menstrual cycle on the brain might add a valuable dimension to her research.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the research community is taking steps to address the dearth of neurobiological research in women, and in <a href="https://www.hachette.com.au/dr-sarah-mckay/female-brain-book" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Women’s Brain Book</a> you’ll meet some of the researchers at the forefront of the movement.</p>
<p>Institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States and academic publications such as the <em>Journal of Neuroscience Research</em> now mandate the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in all research.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) clearly states the research into the health of women and girls is a particular priority. Here in Australia, we have the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, a survey of the physical, mental and psychosocial health of over 58,000 women across their lifespan. Finally, there are some fabulous research initiatives such as Stanford University’s Gendered Innovations project that exist to ‘harness the creative power of sex and gender analysis for innovation and discovery’.</p>

As everyone knows, Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet. She claimed that the sleeping medication Ambien affected her behavior, but her show got cancelled anyway.



Now, I think this scandal raises some surprisingly interesting philosophical questions about moral responsibility and the nature of self-control. What follows is a dialogue between two hypothetical speakers exploring some of these questions. To be clear, this is a post about philosophy, not about Roseanne. I don't know or care if

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/06/DepressionImaging_larger-1-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Depression can have a profound impact on affected individuals and those around them. It is one of the most common mental health conditions, and its symptoms include sustained feeling of sadness, hopelessness, and guilt. In severe cases, these symptoms may be aggravated by suicidal thoughts, or even attempts. The odds of experiencing a depressive episode are relatively high: <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at least</a> one in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/196765" rel="noopener" target="_blank">six</a> individuals will experience an episode in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Although the term <em>depression</em> suggests that it represents a single psychiatric condition, patients vary tremendously in their symptoms, risk factors, and response to available treatment. Risk factors include not only genetic variations and hormonal changes, but also destructive thinking patterns, or stressful and traumatising experiences. Current treatments primarily include medication and psychotherapy. Medication prescribed in depression targets different brain chemical systems, involving neurotransmitters that include serotonin and dopamine. These are involved in communication between nerve cells and, more generally, in the feeling of well-being. Psychotherapy aims to help patients develop effective coping strategies to use when they are faced with challenges and setbacks. Most depressed individuals will eventually recover – however, <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.11.1905" rel="noopener" target="_blank">up to one third</a> may not.</p>
<p>One branch of depression research focuses on finding biomarkers that can identify individuals that will most likely benefit from a specific therapy. The field also works on developing innovative treatments. However, both goals require a better understanding of the underlying biology. Brain imaging research, clinical psychology, and genetics have provided some fascinating answers, but have also posed new challenging questions.</p>
<p><strong>We asked three experts and pioneers in depression research: <em>How do you study clinical depression, what role does brain imaging play in your research, </em><em>and what challenges lie ahead for the field? </em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/mood/cgi-bin/wordpress/?p=243" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ian H. Gotlib</a></strong> (Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, Stanford University):</p>
<p><em>“Over the past two decades, we have learned that depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with wide variations in symptom presentation, age of onset, number and duration of episodes, and causal factors. In my lab, we take this heterogeneity seriously – we administer structured diagnostic interviews to every participant in our studies. And perhaps more important, we conduct multimodal assessments of depression – we examine </em><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02062-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brain structure</a></em><em>, function, and connectivity; endocrine function, both under acute stress and throughout the day; cognitive functioning, including biases in attention, interpretation, and memory; and digital phenotyping of depressed children, adolescents, and adults. </em></p>
<p><em>The number of brain imaging studies has grown exponentially, and there is now a burgeoning literature examining brain structure, function, and connectivity in depressed individuals. Neuroimaging studies have helped to elucidate the neural circuitry involved in reward processing and the processing of emotional experiences. Because the two cardinal symptoms of depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) involve the persistent experience of negative affect and anhedonia, researchers studying depression have focused on examining their neural underpinnings. From these investigations we are learning about anomalous neural characteristics of depressed individuals that may be related to difficulties in daily functioning and that may serve as intervention targets. We know far less, however, about aspects of brain structure, function, and connectivity that place individuals at risk for developing depression, </em><em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2675295?redirect=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that keep high-risk persons</a></em><em> from experiencing depression, and that influence the maintenance of and recovery from this disorder. We also know relatively little about the developmental trajectories of these anomalous neural characteristics, knowledge that is critical in understanding differences between children and adults in the presentation of depression.”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/helen-s-mayberg">Helen Mayberg</a> </strong>(Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai):</p>
<p><em>“Our lab takes a circuit approach to the study of major depression</em><em>:</em><em> Studies integrate </em><em>multimodal</em><em> neuroimaging strategies and quantitative behavioral and psychophysiological metrics within experimental clinical trial protocols to define brain mechanisms </em><em>that </em><em>mediat</em><em>ed</em><em> anti</em><em>–</em><em>depre</em><em>s</em><em>sant treatments. The overarching goal is to develop imaging biomarkers and algorithms that will </em><em>identify</em><em> patient subgroups and optimize treatment</em><em>s for </em><em>individual patients. This work </em><em>also </em><em>serves as a basis for ongoing testing and refinement of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413475/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deep brain stimulation (DBS)</a></em> <em>of the subcallosal cingulate</em><em>, a technique that our lab is investigating</em><em> for treatment resistant depression. </em></p>
<p><em>Imaging has provided new perspectives on understanding the pathogenesis of depression, as well as treatment mechanisms. Studies have systematically defined a core set of consistent regional abnormalities, correlations between symptoms and abnormal function of specific brain regions, and evidence of putative depression subtypes. Multimodal imaging and advanced analytic methods have further provided strategies to build depression circuit models that directly test <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336918/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">treatment selection biomarkers</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>The challenge for the ‘field’ will be to define what method(s) are ‘good enough’ to warrant meaningful replication studies of an encouraging finding. Balancing a useful clinical biomarker that might improve treatment selection or response assessment from those addressing fundamental mechanisms of circuit dysfunction and pathophysiology require different strategies and standards.”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/lindend.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David EJ Linden</a> </strong>(Professor of Translational Neuroscience, Cardiff University and Maastricht University):</p>
<p>“<em>One of the main research techniques used in my group is real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. fMRI allows researchers to trace activation patterns that are associated with external stimuli or internal mental states in real time, and we can feed these activation changes back to patients, so they can learn to regulate them themselves. This opens up interesting potential therapeutic avenues, for example, for </em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733975" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>emotion regulation training in depression</em></a><em>, but also </em><a href="http://www.braintrainproject.eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>other mental disorders</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p><em>Functional brain mapping with fMRI has provided crucial new insights in the neural representations of affect and its disturbances. It has become clear that there are strong links between classical emotion and motivation areas, implemented through functional anatomical links between the limbic system and the basal ganglia, for example, in the ventral striatum. This has sparked renewed interest in the role of reward mechanisms in depression. A future challenge will be to work on the standardisation of imaging protocols across sites and conduct formal studies of the potential diagnostic and predictive value of </em><em>these functional imaging patterns in order to produce clinically useful biomarkers.”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Researchers and clinicians agree that depression can manifest differently in each individual. Neuroimaging and multimodal studies allow investigators to examine underlying mechanisms of such variability, although <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2579940" rel="noopener" target="_blank">identifying robust biomarkers</a> remains challenging. This knowledge informs translational research into new brain circuit-based interventions, including clinical trials of DBS and neurofeedback treatment.  Thereby, the field may “close the loop,” yielding more effective and individually tailored treatments for depression.</p>

<p>The idea that some of us experience “<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-5/feeling-fraud">imposter syndrome</a>” was first mooted in the 1970s by two US clinical psychologists who noticed the preponderance of high-achieving women who felt they had somehow cheated or fluked their way to success and feared being found out. Research on the syndrome has since exploded and it’s become clear that many men also experience similar fraudulent feelings. In fact, in their new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302435">exploratory paper</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, a team of US and German researchers claim that, under pressure, imposter syndrome may hit men harder than women, triggering more anxiety and worse performance – a difference they speculate may be due to traditional gender norms that place a greater expectation on men to be competent.</p>
<p><span id="more-34000"></span></p>
<p>Rebecca Badawy and her colleagues recruited hundreds of female and male undergrads studying communication or business in northeastern USA. They measured their levels of imposter syndrome with an established scale that includes items like “Sometimes I’m afraid others will discover how much knowledge or ability I really lack”.</p>
<p>In one study, the researchers gave the students two sets of five verbal and numerical Graduate Record Exam questions (the GRE is used in the US to select students for graduate programmes). After the first set of questions, the researchers ramped up the pressure for half the students, giving them fake feedback that stated they had answered all of the first five questions incorrectly.</p>
<p>Although imposter feelings were overall higher among women, this harsh feedback seemed to especially affect male students with high imposter feelings – they reported higher anxiety, made less effort (as measured by time taken on the task), and showed a trend towards poorer performance, as compared to others given positive feedback. In contrast, female students with high imposter feelings responded to harsh feedback by increasing their effort and showing superior performance.</p>
<p>It was similar in a second study in which heightened pressure was placed on half the students by telling them that their results on five Graduate Record Exam questions would be shown to a professor on their course (the researchers called this a “high accountability” situation). In this context, men with higher imposter syndrome scores again showed increased anxiety, reduced effort and a tendency toward worse performance, as compared with others who were told their scores would be shown anonymously to a stranger. In contrast, women with imposter feelings were largely unaffected (in terms of anxiety, effort or performance) by the increased accountability situation.</p>
<p>The increase in anxiety, and reduction in effort, shown by men with imposter feelings could be interpreted as reflecting their fear of being found out, combined with a “self-handicapping” strategy – reducing their effort so that they can use this as an excuse to explain the poor performance that they are anticipating.</p>
<p>“Assuming that traditional gender norms hold, males [with imposter syndrome] may have exhibited  stronger negative reactions because they believe that society at large values males who demonstrate high competence and at the same time, do not believe that they can fulfil this standard,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In contrast, the women with imposter feelings appeared less sensitive to the negative feedback and expectation of review by a professor – if anything, they arguably responded to negative feedback in an adaptive way by increasing their effort. The researchers linked this with the traditional cultural expectation that women should be warm rather than competent.  “Being less constrained by gender norm violations and backlash (i.e. they were already expected to perform poorly on competence-based tasks like exam questions), females [with imposter feelings] may have felt freer to attempt to improve their performance (and risk failure) rather than excusing it with lack of time or effort invested,” they said.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know if and how these findings might relate to real-world situations in an  academic setting or workplace. Badawy and her team admit their findings are exploratory and may not generalise. In particular, if their explanation based around gender norms is accurate, one can imagine these norms might vary not just across international cultures, but even between different sub-cultures in the same country – depending, for instance, on the specific gender-based attitudes, beliefs and pressures in different occupations.</p>
<p>These issues aside, Badawy and her colleagues suggest their key finding – of particular male vulnerability to imposter syndrome under pressure – may have practical implications for managers. “If managers of organisational specialists observe evidence of imposter syndrome in male workers currently performing at high levels, they may benefit from making attempts to restore those workers’ sense of agency if they are placed under high accountability situations,” they said. They added that mentoring by professors or managers, skills training and stretch assignments could be potential beneficial strategies (find <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/54774/how-to-beat-the-imposter-syndrome-feeling">more ways to combat imposter syndrome in this 99U article</a>). However, they warned these will only work “if mentors are trained to down regulate their own gender role expectations”.</p>

<p>The average young adult sends more than 100 texts per day, mainly to offer social support to friends and family. But until now, there has been little evidence whether it helps the recipient or not. New <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300918">research</a> in <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i> confirms that sending a comforting text to a partner confronted with a difficult task really can make them feel supported. But more surprisingly, the study suggests that to actually reduce their stress, it’s better to send a message that isn’t explicitly supportive.</p>
<p><span id="more-34002"></span></p>
<p>Emily Hooker and colleagues from the University of California asked 75 women to attempt a stressful set of tasks involving mental mathematics and public speaking. At the start of the experiment they were fitted with a blood pressure cuff to capture information about blood flow and heart rate. While waiting to perform, some participants received texts from their romantic partner who was waiting in the other room. Crucially, some of the partners sent texts (scripted by the researchers) that were comforting (e.g. “Don’t worry. It’s just a psych study. You’ll be fine.”) whereas others sent more mundane texts that were not explicitly supportive (e.g. “It’s cold in here.”). Participants also received a second reinforcing text with the same tone as the first (i.e. either supportive or mundane) while they prepared for their challenge (other participants acted as a baseline control group and received no texts at any point).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After delivering the task, participants who’d earlier received a comforting text reported feeling more supported by their partner (compared with the controls). However, it was only those participants who’d earlier received mundane texts who showed a physical reduction in their stress response, as shown by lower systolic blood pressure during preparation and the task itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There is evidence that attempts to support other people that give the impression of social evaluation – “I can see that you’re struggling” – are ineffective at reducing stress, and Hooker’s team conjecture that the supportive texts, by making direct references to the stressful tasks, may have inadvertently triggered this effect, although this was not explicitly tested for in the study. If so, it adds to research suggesting that “invisible” support – like offering unrelated humour – can be one of the more effective forms of reducing stress through social support. In this case, simply the reminder that the boyfriend was next door, grumbling about the cold, affirmed that the person was not alone, and could receive comfort or validation should that be needed (e.g. if the stressful event went badly).</p>
<p>This finding certainly needs follow-up research to figure out what are the ingredients in different forms of text-based social contact to affect how we feel. It’s worth noting that the effect of the mundane messages also involved a slower recovery to blood pressure baseline than the supportive text or the control condition. So it may be that different kinds of messages can have selective effects on different phases of the stress response. Studies have begun to show downsides of heavy texting use, such as school performance and sleep, although in many cases these may be confounded by use of mobile phones in general. It’s useful, then, to see evidence of something many of us assume and hope for – that contact with loved ones via text can provide them with a sense of being supported during stressful events.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/05/Ebola_Blogs_690x320-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><strong>Early sharing and expedited peer review of relevant research</strong></p>
<p>In response to the ongoing Ebola <a href="http://www.who.int/ebola/en/">outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a><u>,</u> we are creating a <a href="https://channels.plos.org/ebola">PLOS Channel for Ebola Research</a>.  The Channel will make it easy for researchers to keep up with developments and important research related to the outbreak. We will work with authors and our editorial boards to provide rapid review and facilitate the responsible dissemination of preprints. We believe these responses are urgently needed during serious and rapidly developing threats to public health.</p>
<p>All relevant articles published across PLOS will be included in the Ebola Channel, alongside major contributions curated from the broader literature. You can also send any questions or content recommendations to <a href="mailto:ebola@plos.org">ebola@plos.org</a> or tweet us @PLOSChannels using the hashtag #PLOSEbola.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make my Ebola research available quickly?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve created a taskforce to identify editors and reviewers, and to manage an expedited review process across all our journals and platforms.  For authors, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you want to share a single observation (no more than 1 figure or table with commentary) submit to PLOS Currents: Outbreaks</em></li>
<li><em>Submit any other research to one of the 7 PLOS journals; all Ebola-related submissions will be prioritized. (Note that</em><em> <a href="https://www.plos.org/fee-assistance#loc-fee-assistance-programs">fee waiver assistance</a></em><em> is available as needed)</em></li>
<li><em>Share your data and manuscript ahead of submission: large datasets should be deposited in a relevant repository, and manuscripts submitted to a preprint server. Include the DOIs or accession numbers for datasets and preprint in your submission. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to expediting research publications, PLOS believes all data on the Ebola outbreak should be shared as rapidly and openly as possible. We endorse the Wellcome Trust’s <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-findings-and-data-relevant-ebola-outbreak-drc"><u>statement</u> </a>demanding availability of data and research on Ebola. Editorial consideration of research submissions to PLOS journals will not be prejudiced by the early sharing of data or preprints.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned: delivering rapid responses to emergency outbreaks </strong></p>
<p>PLOS saw surges in submissions in previous outbreaks, notably the Ebola outbreak of <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2014/09/05/plos-resources-ebola/">2014</a> and the Zika outbreak of <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/01/07/will-zika-become-the-2016-ntd-of-the-year/">2015/2016</a>. In each emergency, we provided resources to serve the community. In addition, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966">concerns</a> about data sharing during the 2014 Ebola outbreak led PLOS and other journal editors to issue a <a href="http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/blueprint_phe_data-share-results/en/">joint statement</a> encouraging early data sharing. A recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549">report</a> in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> showed that, while increased use of preprints in the 2016 Zika outbreak accelerated the dissemination of research results, the proportion of published articles on Zika that were preceded by preprints remained low.</p>
<p><strong>Our shared responsibility in public health emergencies</strong></p>
<p>We believe research, healthcare, and publishing communities have a responsibility to work together to respond rapidly to public health emergencies. PLOS is committed to disseminating new research findings as efficiently and effectively as possible. We appreciate the opportunity to facilitate access to your work.</p>

<p>Applications are invited for a PhD studentship on Computational frameworks for
high-dimensional neural data with Dr. Shabnam Kadir in the Biocomputation
Research Group in the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research,
University of Hertfordshire, U.K.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>New developments in experimental technology have led to petabytes of raw data
being produced by experimental neuroscientists, which are increasingly publicly
available, e.g. Allen Institute data (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brain-map.org/">http://www.brain-map.org/</a>). In particular,
we are in the realm where population recordings of tens of thousands of neurons
are feasible thanks to, e.g. a new generation of large dense probes for
electrophysiological recordings, imaging using 2-photon microscopy coupled with
calcium fluorescent sensors. Large scale neuronal recordings require novel
approaches for both processing and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>As well as using techniques from high-dimensional statistics, machine learning,
information theory, we aim to explore new approaches from mathematical fields
outside statistics, such as algebraic topology. The study of networks is a
particularly important topic in neuroscience: neurons communicate with each
other electrically via synapses, forming intricate networks. These networks can
be studied using techniques from computational topology (e.g. persistent
homology, clique topology). These could be used to extract information about
subnetworks and assemblies, both from large scale recordings, and via
connectomics derived from simulations (Blue Brain Project).</p>
<p>We aim in this project to go beyond spike sorting and develop new tools and
computational frameworks which would help interpret high dimensional data and
interrogate how information is being processed by the brain, e.g.  How are
sensory stimuli (location in environment, visual and auditory stimuli) encoded?
How can we characterise the neural activity associated with memory, attention,
decision making and motor control?</p>
<p>We shall be collaborating with labs at Imperial, Pennsylvania State University
and UCL.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Avid photographers celebrate the viewfinder as a means of helping us see the world anew. But psychology research has shown that under some conditions taking a photo of something actually makes it harder to remember. One possible reason is that we give less attention to an experience when we know that it will be safely stored in a photograph. But in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368117301687">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition</i>, Julia Soares and Benjamin Storm from the University of California show that the photo-taker’s memory will suffer whether they expect to keep the photo or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-33997"></span></p>
<p>This work aimed to replicate and extend <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311477">a study</a> by Linda Henkel that showed that taking photos of paintings in a museum could lead to poorer recall of those paintings. To make sense of this, Henkel drew on the body of research on<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/29/remembering-together-how-long-term-couples-develop-interconnected-memory-systems/"> transactive memory</a>, which shows that longtime partners or friends distribute memory demands between them, creating a “shared” system where one will remember certain things so the other doesn’t need to. Henkel thought that in a similar fashion we may be treating the camera as a memory partner and offloading the effort onto it. Soares and Storm tested this explanation by separating photo taking from photo having.</p>
<p>The main experiment was a computerised version of Henkel’s museum task. Around 50 undergraduates viewed paintings one at a time onscreen. In one block, participants took a photo of each painting with a smartphone, and then had 15 seconds to look at the painting itself. In a second experimental block, the participants took a photo of each painting, deleted the photo immediately (so they knew it could never been accessed in the future), then had 15 seconds to look at the painting. Finally, in another experimental block, they took no photos and simply viewed each painting for 15 seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After a ten minute delay (during which phones were confiscated) came a multiple- choice memory test probing what the participants remembered about the various paintings. Compared to paintings that were simply viewed, performance was poorer for paintings that were photographed. Critically, this was true both for the condition where the photo was stored, and for the condition where it was deleted, meaning the participant knew they could not rely on it as a future memory partner.</p>
<p>This suggests that offloading may not be the cause of the memory disadvantage associated with taking photos. One alternative explanation is that using a camera forces us to disengage from properly taking in the stimulus, as our attention flows to the mechanics of operating buttons, checking brightness, exposure etc. This is something commonly reported by people as part of their photo-taking experience, and also tallies with the fact that automatic wearable cameras that store images for later don’t produce the memory impairment. However, in the current experiment, after taking pictures (or not), every participant had the same amount of time to take in the paintings without use of equipment, so any distraction effect would need to include some sort of delayed effect on memory processing even after the act of taking a photo was over.</p>
<p>Soares and Storm have a speculative second interpretation. They suggest that the effort involved in taking a photo – getting the framing right, ensuring the lens is in focus – leads to the sense that you’ve done a good job of encoding the object itself, even though you have been focusing more on peripheral features. So you’re not mentally slacking-off because you think the camera has it covered – but because you think you already have. It may be relevant that people who take photographs at events <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/25/taking-photos-will-boost-your-enjoyment-of-experiences-researchers-say/">report afterwards</a> feeling more immersed in the experience, which would tally more with this explanation than the disengagement-due-to-fiddling idea. In any case this is further evidence that those of us who approach exciting life events through the lenses of our electronic devices may be distancing ourselves from fuller participation.</p>

<p>Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that correlates with source proximity in a turbulent environment is the temporal variance of local gas concentration: Gas encounters become more intermittent farther from the source. However, is has commonly been assumed that exploiting this feature requires gas concentration measurements at the millisecond scale, usually requiring expensive photo-ionisation detectors. We have recently shown that, with appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate with source distance [1]. We present a straightforward analysis method to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal, which we denote ‘bouts’. The frequency of these bouts predicted the distance of a gas source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centre- line of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors.</p>

<p>We all know someone who is convinced their opinion is better than everyone else’s on a topic – perhaps, even, that it is the only correct opinion to have. Maybe, on some topics, <i>you</i> are that person. No psychologist would be surprised that people who are convinced their beliefs are superior think they are better informed than others, but this fact leads to a follow on question: are people <i>actually</i> better informed on the topics for which they are convinced their opinion is superior? This is what Michael Hall and Kaitlin Raimi set out to check in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X">a series of experiments</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-33991"></span></p>
<p>The researchers distinguish “belief superiority” from “belief confidence” (thinking your opinion is correct). Belief superiority is relative – it is when you think your opinion is more correct than other people’s; the top end of their belief superiority scale is to indicate that your belief is “Totally correct (mine is the only correct view)”.</p>
<p>The pair set out to find people who felt their beliefs on a variety of controversial political issues (things like terrorism and civil liberties, or wealth redistribution) were superior, and to check – using multiple choice quizzes – how well they were informed on the topics about which they held these superiority beliefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across five studies Hall and Raimi found that those people with the highest belief superiority also tended to have the largest gap between their perceived and actual knowledge – the belief superior consistently suffered from the illusion that they were better informed than they were. As you might expect, those with the lowest belief superiority tended to underestimate how much they knew.</p>
<p>As well as simple background knowledge, the researchers were also interested in how people with belief superiority sought out new information relevant to that belief. They gave participants a selection of news headlines and asked them to select which articles they’d like to read in full at the end of the experiment. Categorising headlines as belief-congruent or belief incongruent, the researchers observed that those participants with higher belief-superiority were more likely to select belief congruent headlines. In other words, despite being badly informed compared to their self-perception, these participants chose to neglect sources of information that would enhance their knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally and more promisingly, the researchers found some evidence that belief superiority can be dented by feedback. If participants were told that people with beliefs like theirs tended to score poorly on topic knowledge, or if they were directly told that their score on the topic knowledge quiz was low, this not only reduced their belief superiority, it also caused them to seek out the kind of challenging information they had previously neglected in the headlines task (though the evidence for this behavioural effect was mixed).</p>
<p>The studies all involved participants accessed via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing the researchers to work with large samples of Americans for each experiment. Their findings mirror the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> – Kruger and Dunning <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367%20">showed that</a> for domains such as judgements of grammar, humour or logic, the most skilled tend to underestimate their ability, while the least skilled overestimate it. Hall and Raimi’s research extends this to the realm of political opinions (where objective assessment of correctness is not available), showing that the belief your opinion is better than other people’s tends to be associated with overestimation of your relevant knowledge.</p>
<p>Overall the research presents a mixed picture. It shows, as others have, that our opinions are often not as justified as we believe – even for the opinions that we are most confident are better than other people’s. On the other hand, it shows that people are responsive to feedback, and aren’t solely driven by confirmation bias when they seek out new information. The final picture is of human rationality that is flawed, but correctable, not doomed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/05/30/how-self-compassion-can-fight-perfectionism/">How Self-Compassion Can Fight Perfectionism</a></h4>

<p>“Be kind to one another.”</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a die-hard Ellen DeGeneres fan to appreciate the value of that motto. And while we’re reminded how kindness goes a long way in our everyday interactions with others, we often forget to apply it to those who need it most: ourselves.</p>
<p>Whether it’s setting a personal weight-loss goal, or believing that we can ace a final exam—all of us are familiar with the experience of setting high standards. We’re even more familiar with the inevitable let-down that comes from not living up to those very standards. </p>
<p>Enter, the life of a perfectionist. </p>
<p>But, importantly, not all perfectionists operate the same. There are different types that are associated with different psychological outcomes.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you strive to attain your ambitious goals and prevent yourself from being overly self-critical, you might be a  personal strivings perfectionist. This isn’t so bad. In fact, this type of perfectionism is more likely to lead to relatively higher levels of self-esteem and decreased levels of negative affect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you constantly believe that you are not good enough, if you judge yourself by your shortcomings, and if you are constantly <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/27/social-media-anxiety-disorders-whats-going-on-in-the-brain/">worried that other people won’t approve of you</a>, then you might be more on the side of maladaptive perfectionism. This form of perfectionism has been linked to depressive symptoms in both adolescents and adults.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder then that researchers are curious to know more about interventions that help buffer against this maladaptive perfectionism. In one  recent study, researchers examined the possibility that self-compassion can protect us against the negative effects of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/19/when-perfectionism-leads-to-an-imperfect-appearance/">maladaptive perfectionism</a>. The questions is, can self-directed kindness increase our chances of living a full, healthy life? Can it combat the symptoms of depression that come from this less ideal version of perfectionism?</p>
<p><strong>Understanding self-compassion</strong></p>
<p>You may ask, “What exactly is self-compassion? And is it something that can be cultivated by anyone, or is a skill that is only available to some of us?” To shed some light on these questions, researchers have broken down self-compassion into three main components: self-kindness, common humanity, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/">mindfulness</a>. </p>
<p>While the first component is self-explanatory, the other two require careful consideration. When something terrible happens to us, often the initial reaction is to sit and wallow in our grief and self-pity. We convince ourselves that no one else is going through similar problems in their lives. But that is simply not true. Statistically speaking, it’s an erroneous judgment. </p>
<p>In order to be more accepting of ourselves, we need to realize that we are never as alone and isolated as we think we are. This is at the heart of common humanity.</p>
<p>At the same time, many of us are prone to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/03/26/different-coping-styles-may-cause-prevent-or-treat-ocd/">over-analyzing painful experiences</a>, or trying to avoid negative feelings altogether. Mindfulness then, is about acknowledging our thoughts, feelings, and emotions without judgement, and accepting them as part of the common human experience. </p>
<p>Back to our study. Taking into account these three sub-components, the researchers in the present investigation set out to predict that self-compassion would weaken the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/24/9-personality-traits-putting-mothers-at-risk-of-postpartum-depression/">relationship between perfectionism and depression </a>in both adolescent and adult populations. </p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>541 adolescents from grades 7 to 10 were recruited for the first study. Participants were asked to complete three online questionnaires during school hours, as part of a larger well-being intervention study. The questionnaires tapped into perfectionism, mood/feelings, self-worth and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/01/25/boost-confidence-with-brain-training/">self-esteem</a>, as well as reported self-compassion.</p>
<p>As predicted, self-compassion was found to moderate, or weaken, the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and depression in this sample of adolescents. Next, the researchers wanted to see if the results would hold for adults. </p>
<p>515 adults from the general population were recruited through online advertisements. Again, participants were asked to complete the same questionnaires. Once again in line with the researchers’ predictions, self-compassion was found to weaken the relationship between perfectionism and depression in the adult sample. What was true for teens was also true for adults later on in life.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
<p>It seems that more than anything, today’s culture values perfection. Parents and teachers may push us towards <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/13/how-does-starting-school-early-impact-educational-attainment/">excellence at school</a>, our friends may judge us by how we dress and act in their company, and perhaps worst of all, our social media accounts constantly fool us into thinking that there are people out there who actually have perfect lives. </p>
<p>Good news, bad news. The bad news is that we can’t completely eradicate perfectionistic thoughts. Good news is that we can try to change our relationship to those thoughts through self-compassion. If we learn to cultivate self-kindness, connection, and mindfulness as we strive toward achieving our goals, any setback we face along the way will be met with greater resilience and mental strength. As a result, we are less likely to fall victim to the debilitating effects of depression, and more likely to live a happy, balanced life.</p>
<p>So, as Ellen DeGeneres reminds us, always be kind to others. But before you do, be sure to look after yourself first. In this case, it’s okay to be a little selfish.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">NeuroMat, the largest institutional contributor on Mathematics on Wikipedia</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">The Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (RIDC NeuroMat), funded by FAPESP, has chosen web, collaborative platforms as its main line of action in terms of science dissemination. This decision was made in 2014 and now the RIDC has become a relevant institutional contributor to Wikimedia projects and the largest institutional contributor on Mathematics on Wikipedia, according to reports from the Outreach Dashboard, that monitors institutional programs and activities on Wikimedia projects.

<p>Scent plays an often <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00778/full">under-appreciated</a> role in sexual attraction, helping to account for why visual attractiveness alone can’t explain just how physically attractive a person is perceived to be. But what role does our ability to smell our partners – or potential partners – play in actual experience?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We know from past research that men born without the ability to smell tend to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/04/04/investigating-the-love-lives-of-the-men-and-women-who-have-no-sense-of-smell/">have fewer sexual partners</a>. And about half of people who lose their sense of smell, through infection or injury, report negative impacts on their sexual behaviour. However, this could be an indirect effect – an inability to smell is often also associated with depression or social insecurity, which can affect aspects of sexuality – and such studies do not tell us whether sense of smell is related to sexual experience among healthy people. Now, in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-018-1203-x">new paper</a> in <i>Archives of Sexual Behavior</i>, Johanna Bendas at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, and her fellow researchers report evidence from healthy, young adults showing precisely that.</p>
<p><span id="more-33985"></span></p>
<p>The researchers studied 42 women and 28 men aged between 18 and 36. They found that there was no relationship between their odour sensitivity (measured using a test that establishes how much of a smelly chemical must be present for the individual to be able to detect it) and either sexual desire or sexual performance (defined as how many times they’d engaged in sexual activity during the previous month and how long, on average, a sexual encounter had lasted).</p>
<p>However, people with a keener sense of smell reported finding their sexual activities more “pleasant”, and women with a greater sensitivity to odours had more orgasms during sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Our data suggest a positive influence of olfactory sensitivity on the sex life of young and healthy participants,” the researchers write. “The perception of body odors such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience” by increasing sexual arousal, they add.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the study, including the correlational design which means other unknown factors might be playing a causal role. Also, while the researchers did control for the use of hormonal contraception in the women, they didn’t consider the stage of menstrual cycle of the female volunteers at the time of the study – something that is known to influence olfaction. Future research in this area should take this into account, and could further explore the influence of specific odours. “The direct measurement of sexual arousal or experience will give further insight into the assumption that olfactory sensitivity improves sexual experience,” the researchers write.</p>

<p>For various reasons, children in many countries are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27848745">increasingly sedentary</a> and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/2017/10October/Pages/Childhood-obesity-soars-worldwide.aspx">childhood obesity is a growing concern</a>. At the same time, research tells us that physical activity is good for children’s minds and bodies, and that if they develop active habits in their youth, they tend to keep them up into adulthood.</p>
<p>It would surely help if children were more active at school, but with growing academic pressures, teachers will tell you that it is difficult to justify sacrificing vital maths and English lessons for more PE classes or games. A possible solution: make academic lessons more physically active. A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1090198118762106">new trial</a> of a 6-week intervention comprising 18 ten-minute active maths and English lessons, published in <em>Health Education and Behavior</em>, suggests that such an approach has great potential.</p>
<p><span id="more-33977"></span></p>
<p>Emma Norris at UCL and her colleagues recruited hundreds of pupils aged 8-9 from 10 London schools. Half were allocated randomly to the active lesson intervention. While they were doing those special classes, the other half of the children acted as a comparison and completed typically taught 10-minute maths and English classes.</p>
<p>Children enrolled in the intervention followed the “virtual traveller” protocol, which involved them performing physical exercises, such as running on the spot, while they travelled the world answering math or English quiz questions pertaining to different countries.</p>
<p>Virtual travel from country to country was depicted via Google Earth videos and other materials embedded in the teacher’s interactive white board presentation.</p>
<p>Further physical activity came from the exercises the children performed to signal whether a given math or English quiz answer was true or false – such as jumping jacks for “true” or performing a football kick for “false”.</p>
<p>Norris and her team had the children wear motion trackers during the classes and also outside of class for two school days per week and two weekend days (these measures were taken at baseline, during the six-week period, and for a few months beyond). Trained observers also monitored the children’s on-task behaviour in class, and the kids completed questionnaires about their engagement levels.</p>
<p>In some ways, the trial was a win-win: the children in the active intervention were more active (based on more light and moderately vigorous activity) during their “virtual traveller” lessons as compared with the control group kids, and what’s more, they also displayed more on-task behavior, in terms of staying more focused on the lesson, following instructions and making more eye contact with their teacher.</p>
<p>This is very promising but perhaps not quite as good as might have been hoped. The children in the active intervention were mostly no more active than the control kids when averaged across entire school days, nor at the weekends, and this was this case both during and beyond the end of the study. That is, they were more active in the specially designed active lessons (it would have been odd if they weren’t), but mostly this didn’t boost their activity levels enough to make any difference when averaging across the whole day (and didn’t spill over into their habits at the weekend).</p>
<p>This lack of a broader benefit could be because the activities in the “virtual traveller” class were not intense enough; the classes were too short and/or infrequent; or perhaps the children compensated for all their in-class exertion by relaxing more later in the day.</p>
<p>Another disappointment is that the physically active lessons did not boost the pupils’ self-reported engagement levels. On the other hand, and interpreting this result more positively, the extra physical activity did not harm their engagement either.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to follow this line of research and see whether longer and/more intense physically active lesson programmes could have bigger benefits for pupils’ lifestyles and whether active lessons might also have an impact on children’s educational performance in the long run.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #338dc8;"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gursatya/">Guru Singh</a>, Director of Scientific Content of Science Exchange, recently spoke with a member of <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/quick-biology-inc">Quick Biology</a>. Follow the interview below.</strong></span><i></i></p>
<p><b>Give us a quick overview of your company. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick Biology Inc. is a genomics startup in Pasadena, CA. We focus on developing new technologies provided to researchers, scientists, and physicians so that they may gain insightful and expedited results from their work. We offer a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) service as well as related reagents to investigate the functions of identified variants. We also help physicians to unlock the potential of NGS in disease diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><b>What accomplishments make Quick Biology Inc. stand out amongst its competitors? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are one of the first sequencing providers to offer an optimized ATAC-seq service for many cell types, and it provides genome-wide profiles of open and accessible regions of chromatin that are indicative of active regulatory regions.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you define the ATAC-seq technique?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ATAC-seq is a sensitive technique used to rapidly assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility with fewer than 100,000 cells. When it is combined with NGS technology, we can obtain accurate results on chromatin accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution.</span></p>
<p><b>How does ATAC-seq stack up compared to traditional methods?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three major advantages of ATAC-seq over existing methods. After library preparation, the DNA is sequenced with NGS technology. As a result, we can obtain accurate results on chromatin accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution. ATAC-seq requires no sonication or phenol-chloroform extraction like FAIRE-seq, no antibodies like ChIP-seq and no sensitive enzymatic digestion like MNase-seq or DNase-seq. Unlike similar methods, which can take up to four days to complete, ATAC-seq preparation can be completed in under three hours so we can provide a quicker turnaround time for our clients. Another clear advantage is the low biological sample requirements. To illustrate, only 50,000 cells are sufficient for ATAC-seq, as opposed to other methods like ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, or DNase-seq that require at least 1,000-fold more material.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell us about your client base and where are they based.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since our NGS service launched back in January 2016, we have served many clients from universities, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies with NGS projects (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, WGS, and WES, etc.) from all over the world. Some of our major clients include Boston Biomedical, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NIH, VA medical center, Harvard University, Stanford University, USC, and UCLA, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell our readers what makes your company competitive in this crowded genomics space?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are equipped in-house with the latest technologies including Illumina NovaSeq 6000, HiSeq X Ten, HiSeq 4000, NextSeq500, MiSeq and Ion Proton instrumentation. Other factors that gives us an edge are our fast turnaround time and our competitive prices. We offer advanced bioinformatics analysis, including analysis for RNA splicing/RNA editing, and high-quality pictures to our clients for publication purposes.</span></p>
<p><b>You’ve made it apparent that Quick Biology Inc. has positioned itself as a leader in the genome sequencing field. What role has Science Exchange played in all of this? Has it made a positive impact on your company? </b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the launch of our NGS service on Science Exchange, we’ve had great experiences working with them. Science Exchange is an integral part of our sales and marketing strategies; it gives us exposure to a global scientific community, allows us to build an online reputation, and enables us to attract potential clients quickly. All of these benefits help Quick Biology Inc. to generate more revenue without exhausting our resources. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Science Exchange’s Sourcing Team is the secret ingredient to their successful business model. They are accommodating in mediating conversations or resolving problems with the client promptly.</span></p>

<p>It’s well-known that we can easily miss objects in our environment that are outside the focus of our conscious attention. “Inattentional blindness” is demonstrated by the famous “<a href="https://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html">invisible gorilla</a>” studies, for example. But there’s a darker side to this phenomenon: if it happens while you’re driving – or if you’re a baggage checker at airport security – the consequences could be fatal.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29578735">new paper</a>, by Joshua Eayrs and Nilli Lavie at University College London, published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, shows that some people can handle more visual information than others before developing this and related kinds of attentional blindness, and this is because they have a greater visual perceptual capacity. “We identified a novel trait that is different from working memory, general intelligence or motivational factors,” Lavie said in a press release.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-33957"></span></p>
<p>In initial studies conducted on 279 visitors to the Science Museum in London, Eayrs and Lavie first assessed participants’ perceptual capacity by asking them to rapidly identify the total number of objects in a scene – a so-called “subitizing” task that measures “the simultaneous, parallel processing capacity for detection and individuation of items”. A series of 162 images of between one and nine randomly sized and positioned black squares were presented for 100 milliseconds each. Previous work has found that, on average, people can reliably enumerate about three to four items and a mean of 3.62 was found for this group.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers then found that people who were better at subitizing – suggesting that they have higher perceptual capacity – were also better at identifying whether two photographs, presented briefly in rapid succession, were identical or very nearly identical (that is, they were less susceptible to a form of inattention known as “change blindness”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In a second study, on 122 more visitors to the Science Museum, the researchers linked a greater subitizing capacity to being less susceptible to “load blindness” as revealed by their superior performance on a task that progressively increased the perceptual load (participants had to try to judge the lengths of lines of an X while also monitoring other changeable elements in the periphery of the scene).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In a third study, the researchers explored whether the superior performance of participants with higher perceptual capacity was simply because they have greater working memory capacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Working memory describes how much information we can hold and manipulate in mind at any time and it’s a key aspect of cognitive functioning that is known to underlie performance on a range of mental tasks, including tests of attention.</p>
<p>A separate group of 43 people completed three different tasks of working memory, as well as the same subitizing task as before, the same change-detection task, and also an object-tracking task, which required them to track four target dots as they moved around the centre of a screen, among four other dots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While working memory capacity did partially explain object-tracking performance, subitizing performance was also important. Also, perceptual capacity (indicated by results on the subitizing task) strongly predicted the participants’ performance on the photograph change-detection task, even when working memory capacity was controlled for.</p>
<p>“Taken together, the results indicate that a single unifying construct appears to underlie subitizing, change detection and [object-tracking] and this construct is distinct from working memory capacity,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Importantly, they say, the work also establishes the subitizing task as a simple way of quantifying an individual’s general perceptual capacity limit. As such, it provides “a potentially powerful indicator of individual abilities relevant to various tasks” – such as working as a pilot or a baggage screener at an airport. “The present research thus provides a scientific basis for devising future personnel selection tests for security and defense,” Eayrs and Lavie conclude.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9528">Power Doesn't Cause Brain Damage</a></h4>

An Atlantic article from July 2017 has been widely discussed on Twitter over the past few days. It's called Power Causes Brain Damage and I remember that it was fairly popular at the time of publication. Its recent revival was prompted I think by Harvey Weinstein's arrest and more generally the abuses of power revealed by the #MeToo movement. The article itself, of course, dating to the pre-Fall of Weinstein era, isn't specifically about this.

In my view, while power is certainly all too
