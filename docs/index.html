This very blog forms a large part of a newly published study on research methods blogs in psychology. The paper has a spicy backstory.







Back in 2016, psychologist Susan Fiske caused much consternation with a draft article which branded certain (unnamed) bloggers as being “bullies” and “destructo-critics” who “destroy lives” through “methodological terrorism.”



Fiske's post (which later appeared in a more moderate version) was seen as pushback against bloggers who criticized the robustne

<p>In 2015, I retired from the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> and presented an exit seminar titled “Career Reflections of a 1970s Feminist,” using my experiences of training and working in medicine and psychiatry from 1975 to 2015 to highlight women’s issues. Afterward, I was surprised by discussions with current women psychiatry trainees, who said that not much had changed in terms of their work experiences.</p><p>This was shocking and sad. Many women who campaigned during the 1960s assumed that inequalities would melt away when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equal Pay Act 1970 were enacted on 29<sup>th</sup> Dec 1979. Instead, throughout 2018 there has been a deluge of media coverage about gender inequalities and sexual harassment.</p><p>The Women’s Movement has a long history dating back to the fifteenth century or before and gathering momentum in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I have in my ancestry two pioneering intellectual women, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-116">Margaret Fuller</a> (1810-1850) and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-82?rskey=st5dzI&amp;result=1">Frances Willard</a> (1839-1898), who were part of the Women’s Movement in America. In those days, their priorities were education and suffrage. They would have been disappointed to think that 200 years later, women were still suffering inequalities. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage">1893</a>, New Zealand became the first country in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. The two World Wars later opened spaces for women to excel outside their domestic spheres.</p><p>Women (and men) have made great strides in this arena, but something has stalled since enactment of our discrimination and equality laws. The immediate response is to gather data and draw up policies and protocol. But these have not worked in the past, so why expect the same process to produce different results next time? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/fawcett-staff">Sam Smethers</a>, CEO of the Fawcett Society, talks of “push back.” Historians of feminism talk about <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth">waves</a> (which implies troughs too). Others talk of “undercurrents” or “stealthy factors,” or instruct in survival strategies such as “leaning in.”</p><p>We do not know why such inertia exists in our social structures. Perhaps ethological (observation of animal behaviour) research in our organisations is the place to start. How do people, men and women, behave in our institutions and why is the resistance to change so strong?</p><p>Consider these three scenarios:</p><p><strong>1. Cauliflower cheese portions:</strong></p><p>This is familiar to many women. You go to the canteen at work with male colleagues and the kindly serving staff dish out your cauliflower cheese. As a woman, mine was often smaller than that of the male doctors I dined with. Portion control was not equal. We paid the same. We were all happy—the men get a good dollop of lunch, I got plenty for my needs and the kindly staff had done their jobs well. But it was not equal. Is it a problem? Is it so much part of our indoctrinations that it is usually invisible? Is this just a clear and amusing example of many, more insidious inequalities that perpetuate gender differences in our social settings? Verdict: More research needed.</p><p><strong>2. Surfing </strong></p><p>It is becoming apparent that women doctors work harder than many men doctors and get paid less. How did that happen when the UK has a national contract? There is focus on clinical awards, who gets extras, career effects of working less than full-time, gender differences in academic medicine, and so on, but ethological research could give insights here too. Consider this stereotyped scenario: male consultant, any specialty, his secretary may make him tea or coffee, hang up his coat, prepare clinic, tribunal, and lecture materials, have letters ready for signing, manage his diary, etc. His team will usually be fully staffed and his operating theatres have their quotas of assistants. What of this happens for his woman colleague? Are more staffing gaps found in teams with women consultants? Who does the extras such as on call rota planning, extra teaching, and pastoral care? Close analysis of the ways institutions support men and women employees differently may show that while men get help to surf the waves, women get ballast and smaller surfboards. Again, more research needed.</p><p><strong>3. Witch hunting </strong></p><p>Something happens in the treatment of women employees as they get older. Just at the stage when they are likely to have fewer domestic commitments and more time available for work, their wisdom and skills seem less valued. At this stage, there seems to be a culling of older women and a stacking up of older men at the hierarchy pinnacles. Some people’s testimonies seem difficult to believe initially, until one considers witch hunting. Why did witch hunting—a gendered phenomenon that defied logic–evolve in some societies in the past, and by which medusa tentacles is such group-think or bias evident now? Why do our social systems need this sort of group behaviour, who initiates it, who perpetuates it, and who benefits from it? More research needed.</p><p>Psychiatry is not the only space in which women are silenced or burdened, but as a discipline it’s one lens through which we can analyse a larger phenomenon. Now more than ever, it’s essential to discuss, in real time, women’s experiences as health professionals and as patients in mental health services. Too often women have been silenced and the gender gap in scientific publications is one example of this. As I edited the essays for this book, I was constantly overwhelmed by their quality, integrity, and content, and so inspired by my wonderful women colleagues.</p><p>Featured image credit: “Medical hospital hallway” by Foundry.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Stress has complicated effects on our memories. Whereas some studies have found that we are better at remembering events that occurred during stressful situations, <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/32/10111%23sec-22">such as while watching disturbing videos</a>, others have shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742709001993">stress impairs memory</a>. Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262618301969">a study</a> published in <i>Brain and Cognition</i> suggests that stress doesn’t influence the strength of our emotional memories at all. Instead, the researchers claim, it is the fidelity of those memories – how distinct and precise they are – that changes when we go through stressful experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37420"></span></p>
<p>Maheen Shermohammeda from Harvard University and colleagues recruited 56 young adults between 18 and 23, and asked them to view a series of negative and neutral pictures. That might seem painless enough – except that half of the participants looked at the pictures while feeling rather stressed. Before they began looking at the pictures, they were told that they would later have to give a speech to a panel of judges. To make matters worse, before seeing each block of pictures they had to complete complicated maths problems. They were given just a short time to complete these, and while doing so they were told that they were performing poorly and their data would be unusable if they didn’t do well. In contrast, the control group had a fairly relaxing time: instead of a speech, they were told they would have to write a story, and they only had to complete simple maths problems at their own pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>About two weeks later, all the participants were given a surprise memory task, in which they again saw the earlier pictures alongside new images they hadn’t seen before. They had to indicate whether each picture was an old one that had been in the original task or a new image they hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>At several points throughout the study, all participants were asked how stressed they were, and also had their heart rate measured and saliva samples taken to analyse levels of the stress hormone cortisol. As expected, the group that went through the stressful experience reported higher levels of stress, and had increased heart rates and cortisol levels (although the team had to exclude a handful of participants who, surprisingly, didn’t report feeling stressed).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, participants in both groups were better at remembering negative images – this replicates a well-established finding that emotional material tends to be more memorable. Also, the stressed group correctly remembered just as many of the earlier images as the control group<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(i.e. their “hit rate” was the same). Crucially, where the groups differed was in their patterns of “false alarms” – how often they falsely remembered new images as being from the original task. The stressed participants were more prone to false alarms for negative images compared neutral images, and the more stressed they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>were, the larger this difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The control group didn’t show any difference between the two kinds of images.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the researchers suggest it’s not the strength of our memories that is influenced by stress, but rather their fidelity, or how distinct they are from other information. For the stressed group, neutral memories became more distinct, making it easier to distinguish them from new neutral material, while negative memories were more vague or blurred, making it harder to distinguish them from new negative material. The results demonstrate the importance of separating out memory into its constituent parts (strength and fidelity), the researchers add, rather than just looking at overall performance or correct “hits”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a rather preliminary result. The pool of participants was small to begin with, and made even smaller after the researchers had to remove those participants who didn’t respond to their stress intervention. And the participants all came from a very young, narrow age range, raising the question of whether older people respond in similar ways.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea that stress has different effects on different components of memory is an interesting proposition that deserves further attention – particularly as understanding memory during periods of stress has important real-world implications for situations like eyewitness accounts of crimes. For example, the researchers said, a “stressed witness to [a] crime … may indeed have a strong recollection of the criminal, but may also have an impoverished ability to discriminate the assailant from other individuals in a police lineup.”</p>

<p><b>More ways to get credit = more reasons to review</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewers’ contributions to the publication process are essential. They are working researchers who give their time and expertise to help authors improve their work and help editors decide when a manuscript is ready to become part of the permanent scientific record. But recognition for reviews often flies under the radar, in part, because tools for tracking these contributions without compromising anonymity may not be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year we rolled out options for signed and published</span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Combined with ORCID, we aim to give reviewers the tools and opportunities to claim credit for their reviews in a way that works for them.</span></p>

<p>It’s a trick that politicians have long exploited: repeat a false statement often enough, and people will start believing that it’s true. Psychologists have named this phenomenon the “illusory truth effect”, and it seems to come from the fact that we find it easier to process information that we’ve encountered many times before. This creates a sense of fluency which we then (mis)interpret as a signal that the content is true. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of course, you might like to believe that your particular way of thinking makes you immune to this trick. But <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n7bze/">according to a pre-print uploaded recently to PsyArXiv</a>, you’d be wrong. In a series of experiments, Jonas De keersmaecker at Ghent University and his collaborators found that individual differences in cognition had no bearing on the strength of the illusory truth effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37408"></span></p>
<p>The researchers wondered whether three aspects of cognition, already known to influence how people make judgments, could determine how prone someone is to the illusory truth effect: cognitive ability or intelligence; the need for cognitive closure (i.e. the desire to avoid ambiguity); and cognitive style (whether someone thinks in a rapid and intuitive manner or takes a slower and more analytic approach). For example, someone who relies more on intuition and wants hard-and-fast answers might be more likely to use the fact that information has been repeated as a cue to its truthfulness.</p>
<p>Across six experiments involving between 199 and 336 participants, the team measured the illusory truth effect while also tapping into these aspects of cognition. The exact methods varied for each study, but generally participants would first read a mix of true and false trivia statements, then complete various cognitive tests and surveys, and finally they would re-read and judge as true or false the earlier trivia statements, as well as new ones interspersed among them. A seventh study was similar but involved fake and real political headlines (the participants’ final challenge in this case was to judge which were real and which were made up).</p>
<p>The researchers found the illusory truth effect across all seven studies: participants were more likely to rate trivia statements and headlines as true/real if they’d seen them previously. Crucially, the strength of this effect did not vary according to the participants’ cognitive ability or style, or need for closure. (A couple of studies found some small significant associations, but these disappeared when the researchers integrated all the data.)</p>
<p>These results suggest that we are all predisposed to believe repeated information regardless of our own particular cognitive profile. And while that might make us all susceptible to advertising and the fabrications of dishonest politicians, the researchers have a more optimistic take. “These novel findings are in line with the assertion that processing fluency is not a judgmental bias and flaw in the individual, but rather a cue to truth that is universal and epistemologically justified in most contexts”, they write. In other words, it’s not that there’s a foolish subgroup of people who are more vulnerable to the “illusory truth” effect, but rather it’s an advantageous and universal bias that’s arisen because most of the time fluency actually <i>is</i> a reliable signal of truth. For example, a statement that is often repeated may tend to be endorsed by more people, which could be a useful cue to its truth.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual differences relating to the illusory truth effect waiting to be discovered, the team adds. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, seem to show a less strong effect, suggesting that certain fundamental aspects of memory and cognition may be required to support the effect. With a greater willingness to publish null results like this one – and not just leave them in the file drawer – researchers should be able to build up a much more complete picture of the illusory truth effect and other cognitive biases.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>You may be best advised not to read this article late at night or before you eat. Psychologists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Charles University in the Czech Republic have surveyed a large sample of non-clinical volunteers to gauge their reaction to 24 creatures that are commonly the source of specific animal phobias.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12409">published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em></a>, not only contribute to our understanding of animal phobias, but could prove incredibly useful to horror writers. Among the key findings is that spiders were unique in being both intensely fear- <em>and</em> disgust-inducing in equal measure. The researchers said this may be due to their mix of disgusting properties – including their “quirky ‘too-many-legs’ body plan” – combined with the fact they are “…omnipresent in our homes, often lurking in the hidden dark places and capable of fast unpredictable movement.” In other words, the intense fear arises in part from the prospect of coming into physical contact with a creature perceived by many to be revolting.</p>
<p><span id="more-37399"></span></p>
<p>Jakub Polák and his team recruited nearly 2000 people online and asked them to rate how frightening and disgusting they found 25 creatures, including – alongside the spider – a snail, dog, bull, maggot, cockroach, two kinds of snake (a viper and a grass snake), and ant. See the image above for the full list.</p>
<p>Depicted in photographs on-screen, this particular selection of species – aside from the red panda, which acted as a non-fear-inducing control – was chosen because they are frequently the source of animal phobias.</p>
<p>Categorising the creatures based on the levels of fear and disgust that they elicited, the researchers identified five groupings: fear-relevant, non-slimy small animals, such as cockroaches, ants and wasps; mouse-like animals, such as mouse, rat and bat, which scored low on elicited fear and disgust; snakes and lizards; parasites, such as lice and tapeworm, which triggered high disgust; and finally, farm or pet mammals, such as cat, dog and horse, which generally elicited low fear and disgust.</p>
<p>One explanation for common animal phobias is that they reflect an exaggerated, uncontrolled form of innate fears for certain creatures that we all share, particularly for creatures that imperilled our ancestors, such as spiders and snakes. Consistent with this evolutionary account, spiders and venomous snakes elicited the strongest fear reactions among the participants, while parasites elicited the strongest disgust reactions (consistent with the idea that disgust motivates a form of protective “behavioural avoidance”). However, less consistent with the evolutionary perspective on animal phobias is that 14 of the creatures elicited virtually no fear, including rats, mice and lizards, even though these animals are commonly the source of phobias.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that, similar to spiders, the parasitic creatures like tape-worm and roundworm were both highly disgust-inducing (even more than the spider) while at the same time being rated as highly fear-inducing (even more than, say, the wasp or grass-snake). <span>Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, this combined fear and disgust reaction to intestinal parasites has evolved because they infect us with microscopic larvae meaning we rarely see them with our eyes, yet we are aware they are omnipresent. Once again, as with spiders, we cannot rely only on disgust (and behavioural avoidance) to protect us, and so we also fear unwanted physical contact. The maggot, by contrast, may elicit less fear because it can be seen and avoided more easily.   </span></p>
<p>Some other details to emerge from the study are that women generally gave higher fear and disgust ratings than men, and especially for non-slimy invertebrates and repulsive human parasites – this may be in line with evolutionary theory because “women as a sex with higher reproductive cost need to be extra careful of pathogens threatening not only their health but also the [health] of their children.”</p>
<p>Also, the researchers asked their participants about any past traumatic experiences with animals, such as being seriously bitten by a dog or scratched by a cat. Surprisingly perhaps, they found that fear ratings were <em>lower</em> among people with such a bad experience in their past. However, this correlation makes sense if you consider that people with a greater fear of animals may be be more cautious and less likely to get hurt. “Our results … suggest that fear and disgust could protect subjects against harm even in our modern environment,” the researchers said. In excess, fear can be debilitating and unwelcome, but this last result is perhaps a reminder that it is also there to serve a purpose – including to protect us from the creatures that may bite us while we sleep or infect us from within.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Hearing voices that don’t exist in the outside world is the most common form of hallucination experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related conditions and it can be very distressing. However, there is a growing recognition that hearing voices is not always pathological. Many mentally well people hear voices (or “auditory verbal hallucinations”) – in fact, around 6-7 per cent of adults in the general population report having had such experiences at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>This has led some experts to propose a “continuum model” in which the same fundamental underlying mechanism leads to hearing voices in healthy people and in patients with a clinical diagnosis, but that for various reasons, such as a traumatic past, the experience is more troublesome and distressing for the patients. However, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/45/4/733/5149404">a new open-access paper</a> in <em>Schizophrenia Bulletin</em> challenges the continuum model, finding an important brain difference between patients who hear voices and voice-hearing healthy controls.</p>
<p><span id="more-37393"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Jane Garrison and Iris Sommer, recruited three groups matched for age, education, sex, handedness and overall brain volume: 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related conditions such as nonspecific psychosis or schizoaffective disorder) who hear voices; 50 non-clinical healthy volunteers who hear voices (at least once per week); and 50 healthy controls who do not hear voices.</p>
<p>The researchers scanned all their participants’ brains, specifically looking at the length of a brain structure involved in “reality monitoring” or telling the difference between internally and externally generated experiences. For instance, a typical test of reality monitoring involves asking a person to read or imagine different words, and then asking them to recall which words they’d read and which they’d imagined.</p>
<p>Garrison and her colleagues wanted to test the idea that a problem with reality monitoring contributes to the voice-hearing experience in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy people who hear voices. To test this account, they used the scans to measure the length of a brain structure called the paracingulate sulcus (PCS) – this is the most frontal area of the medial prefrontal cortex and previous research has suggested that it is involved in reality monitoring. For instance, people for whom the PCS is completely absent (up to a quarter of the general population by some estimates) tend to struggle with reality monitoring tasks.</p>
<p>As they predicted, the researchers found that their patient volunteers had a shorter PCS than the healthy non-voice-hearing controls, <em>and</em> a shorter PCS than the voice-hearing healthy controls. In contrast, there was no (statistically significant) difference in the length of the PCS between the voice-hearing healthy controls and the controls who did not have hallucinations.</p>
<p>Garrison’s team believe this result is consistent with there being two routes to auditory hallucinations (see image, above). For healthy people who hear voices, the researchers believe the origin is in hyper-activation of sensory parts of the brain involved in processing auditory information. For patients with schizophrenia, by contrast, they believe there is a sensory component combined with a problem with reality monitoring.</p>
<p>“These findings, together with our previous work, corroborate a model in which part of the mechanism underlying hallucinations is shared between clinical and nonclinical individuals with hallucinations,” the researchers said, “while a second mechanism, compromising [in]adequate reality monitoring, is present in patients only.”</p>
<p>This two-route model could explain some of the differences in the voice-hearing experience reported by patients and healthy voice-hearers, such as the lower frequency and shorter duration of the experience in the latter group. In healthy voice-hearers, hyper-activation of sensory areas is likely to be a relatively exceptional event, and their intact reality monitoring can also suppress the experience. For patients, by contrast, hyper-activation of sensory areas may not need to be so intense, and they may not have the necessary reality monitoring capabilities to inhibit or make sense of their hallucinations – consequently their voice hearing is more frequent and long-lasting.</p>
<p>The new findings also chime with past research that has suggested important differences between clinical and non-clinical voice hearers at a neurobiological level. For instance, patients with schizophrenia have been shown to have heightened synthesis of the brain chemical dopamine, potentially contributing to seeing intense meaning in sensations and experiences (known as “aberrant salience”), whereas non-clinical voice hearers do not show this same abundance of dopamine.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that the new findings – and the two-route model – cannot account for some of the differences in the experiences of patients who hear voices and healthy people who hear voices, such as the more negative (angry, upsetting and controlling) content in the hallucinations reported by patients.</p>
<p>Also, it’s worth noting that, among the healthy voice-hearers in this study, the length of the PCS was intermediary between the patients and non-voice-hearing controls. It’s possible, the researchers admitted, that the reason the difference in PCS length between the two healthy groups was found to be statistically non-significant may have been due to a lack of statistical power. They said that replication of this study with larger samples could clarify this issue, adding that “…further research is [also] needed to to assess the extent to which the present results generalise to other nonclinical populations with hallucinations who may have different etiology and phenomenology of hallucinatory experience.”</p>

A paper just out in eccentric medical journal Medical Hypotheses caught my eye yesterday:



Potential role of calcifying nanoparticles in the etiology of multiple sclerosis



Hmm, I thought, this looks interesting. I'd never heard of the idea that nanoparticles could cause neurological illness.



So I read the paper and quickly found myself falling down a (nano)rabbithole into a fascinating and little-known tale of strange science.







It turns out that the 'calcifying nanoparticles' ment

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/06/21/policy-on-short-works/">arXiv’s policy on short works</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is a part of the scholarly scientific community, and we strive to participate in and adapt to the changing needs of the community. Recently, we have been discussing whether arXiv should consider hosting short works, which include research discoveries, results or data without context or interpretation and do not conform to accepted standards conventional, peer-reviewed journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to keep in mind arXiv‘s goals, mission, and scope, and how arXiv achieves these for the community. arXiv provides e-prints, including preprints and author’s version of accepted manuscripts, in specific scientific disciplines. We expect submissions to arXiv to be topical and refereeable scientific contributions that follow accepted standards of scholarly communication, as exemplified by conventional mainstream journal articles. Therefore, submission should be self-contained, in the sense that they can be read and understood without excessive reference to other papers, and have sufficient, non-trivial original content, including original research or useful new exposition of existing results (i.e. review article).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are subjective criteria, and so our </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/moderation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moderation process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evaluates the suitability and value of submissions to our arXiv communities. We rely heavily on the expertise and judgement of 168 volunteer moderators and the quality control of our staff who review submissions and address correspondence. Together, they handle about 21% of our annual 140,000 submissions, which has exponentially increased by about 30% every year . If we were to modify our scope of acceptable material and accept short works in bulk, the submission rate could potentially greatly increase to a level that arXiv cannot sustain with its current structure and resources.</span></p>
<p><b>Therefore, given arXiv’s goals, mission, and resources, arXiv cannot actively or explicitly encourage submissions of short works and similar types of material.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at arXiv, we value the importance of embracing and supporting scientific communication innovations, and we want to explore how we can support new forms. So, for the next 12 months, short, unrefereed submissions that have passed the checks of being a research article will proceed through the moderation process. In practice, it will mean that these short submissions will be placed “on hold” and not appear until approved by a moderator. Depending on the moderator load, the hold time will vary, from being not appreciable to the user to multiple days. There will be no change to how standard-length submissions are handled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the 12-month trial period we will assess the situation and evaluate if any changes are necessary. However, given currently allocated resources for arXiv and our moderators, if this process becomes unsustainable we will prematurely end it. While this may be disappointing, we have to bear in mind that our priority is the core mission and operations, so any new experiment cannot happen to the detriment of these top priorities.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does “unsustainable” mean in practice?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unsustainable process for arXiv means that too much effort is required by moderators to keep up with the submissions and appeals volume; symptoms and warning signs will include a growing “hold” queue. We will remain vigilant in monitoring the process and hope users appreciate this effort and cooperate with arXiv in this experiment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I cooperate?</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before submitting a short work to arXiv, consider if it meets the criteria of a research article. Does it meet the criteria of a research article, either refereeable or self-contained with sufficient non-trivial new content? It should contain research discoveries, results or data with context or interpretation.</span></li>
<li>If you submitted something and it was put “on hold” please be patient. Remember: our moderators are doing their best, but they have volunteered their limited time and resources.</li>
<li>If you submitted something and it was removed, carefully read the accompanying message and understand that there is limited ability of administrators and moderators to provide feedback on submissions that are determined to be inappropriate for arXiv. You will need to consider if you would like to put in the effort required to make the submission better aligned with arXiv main scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signed,</span></p>

<p>There is increasing recognition that while our personality traits are stable enough to shape our lives profoundly, they are also partly malleable, so that our choices and experiences can feedback and influence the kind of people we become. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300825">new study</a> in the<em> Journal of Research in Personality</em> shines a light on a highly consequential behaviour that captures this dynamic – smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>The results add “… to existing knowledge on the implications of smoking by showing that this behaviour is also likely to alter individuals’ characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-37376"></span></p>
<p>It’s already well established that, by virtue of their traits, some people are more disposed than others to take up smoking – namely those who are more extraverted, less emotionally stable and less conscientious. The new research, led by Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier, suggests (but does not prove) that this habit can then feedback and shape smokers’ traits.</p>
<p>Using repeated measures of people’s personality traits over many years, the researchers report that smokers display personality changes that are different from those seen in non-smokers, especially in terms of reduced emotional stability and reduced extraversion.</p>
<p>The data come from five large surveys of middle-aged and older volunteers, four in the US and one in Japan. Ranging in size from just over 600 participants to over 6000, the surveys included information on whether the participants smoked and measures of their personality traits collected repeatedly over time spans from 4 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that smokers showed declines in emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness, relative to non-smokers. However, the precise patterns of change varied across the different samples. The most consistent pattern was for smokers to show relative declines in emotional stability and extraversion.</p>
<p>Stephan and his team also looked to see if stopping smoking had any positive personality consequences. In fact, there was little evidence of this. If anything, stopping smoking was associated with declines in agreeableness. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because of a loss of “smoking-related social interactions”; residual adverse effects of smoking; and due to health-related side-effects associated with smoking cessation, such as “heightened risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes” both of which are known to have unhelpful consequences for personality traits.</p>
<p>The study is impressive for the size of the samples and the use of a longitudinal methodology that followed the same people over time. However, it’s limited by the reliance on participants’ self-reports of their own traits; the lack of information on smoking intensity; the skew towards older participants; and it’s inability to offer insights into why smoking would seem to lead to mostly adverse personality changes.</p>
<p>The researchers speculated that the health-related harms of smoking might be a factor mediating the habit’s apparent effects on personality. Health consequences of smoking such as insomnia, depression and reduced cardio-vascular fitness are known to have negative effects on personality. “Furthermore,” Stephan’s team add, “smoking may alter the energetic capacities needed to maintain emotional stability, the tendency to be exploratory, cooperative and altruistic, self-disciplined and playful, and enthusiastic and active.”</p>
<p>A curious detail in the findings is that, unlike the US samples, differences in personality change were not found among smokers in Japan compared with non-smokers. The researchers said this result may be an extension of what has become known as the “Japanese smoking paradox” – the fact that even though smoking rates are higher in Japan than the US, rates of lung cancer and mortality risk are lower.</p>
<p>Overall, this new research represents “the largest and longest longitudinal examination of the association between smoking and personality change in adulthood,” the researchers said. The results suggest that the “deleterious effects of smoking may extend to detrimental personality changes,” they added.</p>
<p>However, and as the researchers acknowledge, this conclusion, while highly plausible, comes with a hefty caveat – the observational study design cannot prove that smoking causes personality change. It’s possible that another factor or factors, such as stressful life circumstances, both increase the likelihood of people taking up smoking and cause unwelcome long-term personality changes. It’s also possible that pre-existing personality dispositions drive both the uptake of smoking and the later trajectory of personality change over time.</p>
<p>Future research that collects more detailed baseline contextual data on participants may be able to test these possibilities. In the meantime, if you are ever tempted to take up smoking, it is worth considering that it is not just your health you are putting at risk, but quite likely also your personality.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The “learning style” myth – the idea that we each have a preferred modality for learning, usually described as visual, auditory or kinaesthetic – just won’t die. Belief in learning styles endures even though psychologists have pointed out repeatedly the many problems with the concept. Students <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">don’t benefit from learning in their supposedly preferred style</a>, for example, and teachers and their pupils <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/">don’t agree on the pupil’s learning style</a> in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But exactly how believers in learning styles conceive of the concept has until now remained unclear. It could be that people take an “essentialist” view that our learning style is something we are born with, for instance. On the other hand, they may believe that learning styles are more liable to change – a “non-essentialist” perspective. A new study in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/edu0000366">the Journal of Educational Psychology</a> has found that, in fact, both views are common, a result that could have implications for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37366"></span></p>
<p>Shaylene Nancekivell and colleagues at the University of Michigan asked 331 adults who believed in learning styles to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with 15 statements that laid out an essentialist view of the myth. These ranged from suggesting that learning styles are innate (e.g. “In the future, scientists will be able to determine a person’s learning style by examining their genes”) to implying that learning styles can predict success (e.g. “A person’s learning style predicts the kinds of teachers from whom they learn best”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall the participants’ responses were quite inconsistent: for example, they tended to agree that learning styles can be detected in childhood, but disagree that they are inherited from their parents. And the average rating for all statements fell almost exactly in the midpoint of the scale.</p>
<p>However, further analysis revealed two key subgroups hiding in the pool of participants. Based on patterns in their responses, the researchers identified one group they called “essentialisers”, who more strongly endorsed more of the statements, and another group of “non-essentialisers”.</p>
<p>The researchers then ran a second experiment to find out more about the beliefs of the two groups. Participants read a short story about a baby whose biological and adoptive parents had different learning styles (one set of parents were “visual” learners and the other “kinaesthetic”, for instance). The essentialisers indicated that the child was most likely to develop the learning style of their biological parents, while the non-essentialisers rated the learning style of the adoptive parents higher. Essentialisers were also more likely to believe statements relating learning styles to brain differences, such as “Brain imaging can be used to identify a person’s learning style.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results suggest that people’s beliefs about learning styles vary much more than previous studies have recognised, the authors say. Some people appear to believe more strongly than others that learning styles are hard-wired in our brains and genes – and this could potentially make them more resistant to efforts to debunk the myth, the researchers suggest. “The present studies provide a new starting point for research on learning styles and suggest that future research on neuroscience-based myths needs to move beyond merely assessing the rate at which they are endorsed,” they write.</p>
<p>It would be useful to know whether certain individuals are predisposed to being essentialisers, but for now this remains unclear. Neither age, gender nor level of education predicted which participants were in which group. And most dishearteningly, the teachers who took part in this new research were just as likely to take an essentialist view of learning styles as the remaining participants. If essentialist views about learning styles really are more resistant to change, then understanding what makes a person think that way will be important for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Quelle est la part de l’inné et de l’acquis dans l’intelligence, ou plus généralement dans les facultés cognitives ? C’est une question très controversée, en particulier parce qu’elle a une grande portée politique : l’éducation est-elle importante, ou bien tout est-il prédéterminé par nos gènes ? Il est évident que dans le second cas, investir dans l’éducation semble vain ; il devrait plutôt s’agir de faire de la sélection et de l’orientation que de l’éducation.</p>
<p>Il existe une littérature scientifique abondante sur ce sujet, malheureusement ses résultats sont souvent mal interprétés et déformés par des idéologues. Prenons l’exemple d’une <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/les-profs-tombent-dans-le-piege-de-l-adn_2083387.html">récente tribune</a> de l’essayiste Laurent Alexandre dans l’Express :</p>
<p><em>« 64% de nos différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques ; l’école et la famille n’ont malheureusement qu’un rôle marginal face à nos chromosomes ».</em></p>
<p>Je vais supposer que la première assertion est correcte et bien établie scientifiquement. La conclusion est non seulement fausse, mais absurde. Revenons quelques siècles en arrière. Génétiquement, la population était sensiblement la même qu’aujourd’hui. Mais peu de gens apprenaient à lire, donc peu de gens savaient lire. Par conséquent, oui, l’éducation et la famille ont un rôle déterminant dans les capacités de lecture. Par ailleurs, si l’on avait fait la même étude sur la population de l’époque, on aurait trouvé non pas 64% mais une proportion bien plus faible de déterminisme génétique, puisque les capacités de lecture étaient en premier lieu déterminées par la possibilité d’apprendre à lire. Inversement, si l’éducation était la même pour toute, par exemple si on avait institué une école publique pour tous avec des programmes nationaux strictement appliqués de manière uniforme, eh bien on trouverait que très peu de différences de quoi que ce soit sont expliquées par l’éducation, puisque ce ne serait pas un facteur variable.</p>
<p>Une assertion du type « 64% des différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques » est une mesure contextuelle, qui reflète en grande partie la variabilité de chacun des facteurs. En aucun cas elle n’indique un rôle causal faible pour l’éducation ou l’environnement familial. Elle peut tout aussi bien indiquer une certaine homogénéité de l’éducation reçue. Tout ce qu’elle indique, tout ce qu’indique cette littérature en général, c’est que les facultés cognitives sont influencées par des facteurs à la fois génétiques et environnementaux.</p>
<p>Etant donné que l’on ne sait pas lire spontanément mais uniquement après l’avoir appris, il faut une certaine dose d’aveuglement idéologique pour prétendre que l’école y joue un « rôle marginal ». Certes, il faut aussi avoir un cerveau pour pouvoir lire, d’où les facteurs génétiques. Par exemple, un ver de terre ne sait pas lire. Rien n’indique cependant que ces « 64% » de variation d’origine génétique concernent le cerveau. Il faut aussi des yeux pour pouvoir lire, par exemple. Des difficultés de lecture liés à un problème ophtalmologique d’origine génétique seront comptées dans ce total. De même, si (expérience de pensée) l’éducation des enfants étaient biaisée en fonction de facteurs physiques d’origine génétique, alors ce biais apparaîtrait également comme facteur génétique. Ce n’est sans doute pas ce que l’on veut dire par « facteur génétique des capacités de lecture », mais c’est quand même ce qui est mesuré.</p>
<p>La question qui a un intérêt politique, ce n’est pas : quelle part de la variabilité des capacités de lecture dans un contexte éducatif et socioculturel donné peut être expliqué par des variations génétiques (neurogénétiques ou non, purement biologiques ou conditionnés à des facteurs socioculturels) mais plutôt : dans quelle mesure améliorer l’éducation peut-il améliorer les capacités de lecture ? Pour répondre, on peut faire appel à l’histoire plutôt qu’à la génétique, et la conclusion est sans appel : historiquement, plus de gens ont su lire lorsqu’on leur a enseigné la lecture.</p>
<p>En résumé, oui l’éducation a un rôle majeur dans les capacités cognitives comme la lecture, et la science ne dit pas le contraire. Evidemment.</p>

<p>It usually helps to “get a fresh pair of eyes” on a problem, especially from someone with a different perspective than your own. But what if you could find a variety of vantage points from within yourself? After all, each of us has multiple roles and identities in life. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, a team led by Sarah Gaither at Duke University presents evidence that prompting children to think about their own multiple identities boosts their problem-solving skills and increases their flexible thinking.</p>
<p>“Someone can be a woman and White, a teacher and a parent, a girl and a friend,” the researchers write. “Although individuals may not automatically reflect on their multiple identities, here we propose that when they do, it may have positive consequences for their creative problem solving and flexible thinking.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37354"></span></p>
<p>In the first of three studies, Gaither and her team split 48 six- and seven-year-olds into two groups. One was the intervention group and these participants spent time reflecting briefly with a researcher about eight of their various social identities, such as “friend”, “girl” and “reader”. This process concluded with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you are lots of things at the same time.” The other group served as a control and these participants chatted briefly with a researcher about eight of their different physical attributes, such as having two feet and a mouth. Similar to the intervention condition, the control condition ended with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you have a lot of things at the same time.”</p>
<p>Afterwards all the children completed four different problem solving and flexible thinking challenges. One test involved them figuring out how a bear with a bowl of lego could reach honey in a high branch on a tree* (they were told that even stacked together the lego couldn’t reach). Another test involved coming up with novel uses for a gold box. The third involved categorising a collection of photos of 16 individuals in as many ways as possible. The last task involved an interaction with a puppet who made 16 claims about different pairs of items or individuals belonging to the same category, such as a dog and cat being the same kind of animal, or a male and female child being the same kind of person. When the child agreed the puppet was correct, this was taken as a sign of flexible thinking.</p>
<p>The findings were consistent, with the children who reflected on their multiple identities outperforming the children in the control condition on all four of the tests. For instance, half the children in the multiple identities condition solved the bear puzzle, compared with just 12.5 per cent of the control condition children; and the children agreed with the puppets’ broad-minded thinking over six times, on average, compared with under four times on average among the controls.</p>
<p>In two follow-up studies with dozens more children, the researchers showed that reflecting on another person’s multiple identities, as opposed to one’s own, did not have the same benefit; and that some of the performance gains associated with thinking about one’s own multiple identities were greater when these were phrased in a way that made them sound a stable part of the self rather than a transient preference – reflecting on being <em>a helper</em> rather than enjoying helping, for instance.</p>
<p>Past research with adults had already shown benefits to creative thinking of reflecting on one’s own different social identities. This new research builds on those findings by extending them to children, and showing that the benefits are limited to reflecting on one’s own social identities, as opposed to one’s physical attributes, or reflecting on the social identities of others. The new results also jibe with past research showing that travelling abroad and visiting other cultures can increase open-mindedness and creativity. It’s possible that reflecting on one’s own varied social identities helps to activate memories of diverse experiences and perspectives, thus helping trigger more flexible thinking – however, more research is needed to identify the precise mechanisms at play.</p>
<p>The idea that a short, simple intervention could have such seemingly dramatic effects will likely raise the eyebrows of more sceptical readers. Successful replication attempts with larger samples and diverse participants may help alleviate these doubts. Future research could also look into whether the multiple identities intervention would have greater benefits for individuals with more diverse social roles and experiences (for children raised in multicultural or multi-racial homes, for instance), and whether reflecting on social roles that one perceives negatively would still be beneficial.</p>
<p>“Our discovery suggests that anyone–regardless of their racial group or other social identification–may benefit from a multifaceted mindset,” the researchers said. “Something as simple as thinking about one’s identity from multiple angles could increase open-mindedness in a society that is becoming increasingly diverse.”</p>
<p>—<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">Thinking about multiple identities boosts children’s flexible thinking</a></p>
<p>*The answer is by emptying the bowl, inverting it and using it as a step to stand on and reach higher.</p>

In fact, she was drawn to Buddhist philosophy precisely <i>because </i>of its negation of self. In the doctrine of non-being (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta" target="_blank"><i>anātman</i></a>),  “there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul, or essence in living beings.” The tenet of emptiness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81" target="_blank"><i>śūnyatā</i></a>) <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> that “all things are empty [or void] of intrinsic existence”  <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> was problematic as well. When applied and interpreted incorrectly, <i>śūnyatā</i> and <i>anātman </i>can resemble or precipitate disorders of the self.<br /><br />Dr. Pickering noted: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>‘Eve’ is representative of a number of patients suffering both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization" target="_blank">derealisation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization" target="_blank">depersonalisation</a>. They doubt the existence of the outer world (derealisation) and fear that they do not exist. In place of a sense of self, they have but an empty core inside (depersonalisation).</i></blockquote><br />How do you find your way back to your <i>self</i> after that? Will the psychotic episode respond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" target="_blank">neuroleptics</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer" target="_blank">mood stabilizers</a>?<br /><br />The current article takes a decidedly different approach from this blog's usual themes of neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopharmacology.

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/06/18/upcoming-arxiv-leadership-transition/">Upcoming arXiv Leadership Transition</a></h4>

<p>It has been almost ten years since I assumed the oversight of arXiv, as part of my Associate University Librarian responsibilities, with the charge of developing an organizational framework, governance model, sustainability plan, and roadmap for maintaining and developing this mission-critical resource. The arXiv leadership team believes that the service requires a full-time director as the operation continues to expand and as we register progress toward the much-needed technical architecture renewal process. I will be stepping down as arXiv Program Director in August and am pleased to announce that we’ve posted a full-time <a href="https://cornell.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/CornellCareerPage/job/Ithaca-Main-Campus/Executive-Director-of-arXiv_WDR-00019335-1">Executive Director</a> position to hire my successor. This is yet another important milestone since we <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/arxiv-looks-future-move-cornell-cis">moved arXiv</a> from the Library to Computing and Information Science at Cornell in January 2019.</p>
<p>A year ago, I started a half-time position at <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/">Ithaka S+R</a> as Senior Advisor and am looking forward to making a full transition to research, writing, and strategic planning related to digital scholarship, open science, and preservation. So conceptually, I’ll not be that far away from arXiv and have opportunities to contribute to national and global initiatives to advance research and scholarship and build a sustainable infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the most gratifying aspects of my arXiv affiliation over the years has been collaborating with the dedicated and supportive scientific and  scholarly communication communities. Working on arXiv has been an immensely gratifying, stimulating, and demanding role that has taught me a lot, especially about the importance of sociocultural and policy issues in scholarly communication and research. Throughout the years, I’ve benefited greatly from the advice and support from so many of you. I am grateful for having the opportunity to lead arXiv and look forward to watching it advance and innovate to serve the scientific community’s evolving needs.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>

<p>Loneliness <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">is a “disease”</a>, associated with an increased risk of death equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Strides have been made in understanding what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/">form of loneliness</a> is damaging<i> </i>(a lack of<i> close</i> relationships with other people, rather than a lack of relationships per se), but ways to tackle loneliness are badly needed. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/">new study</a>, available as a preprint on PsyArXiv, reveals a way in which loneliness seems to be maintained and, therefore, a potential route to an intervention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37348"></span></p>
<p>A popular model of loneliness holds that it is maintained by abnormal processing of the social signals – such as smiles and eye contact – that underlie positive social interactions. One consequence of this abnormal processing could be a failure to automatically mimic other people’s facial expressions – a phenomenon that occurs naturally during most social interactions. To investigate for the first time whether this is the case, Andrew Arnold and Piotr Winkielman at the University of California, San Diego conducted a small, preliminary study on 35 student volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students first completed three scales that measured their loneliness, depression and personality. Based on the loneliness results, they were classed as either lonely or not lonely. Next they had electrodes attached to two pairs of their own facial muscles important for generating emotional expressions – regions of the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles in the cheeks, and also the corrugator supercilii (frowning) muscles in the brow. They were then shown video clips of men and women making facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scales that they were given to complete showed that the lonely and non-lonely students were equally good at distinguishing between facial expressions, and there were no group differences in the strength of “negative emotion” ratings to anger, fear and sadness or “positive” ratings to joy. So the lonely people could recognise and understand emotional expressions just as well as the non-lonely group. However, there were important differences in how their <i>own</i> faces responded spontaneously to the video clips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When members of both groups saw videos of people displaying anger, for example, their own brows moved to automatically mimic this expression. But when the expression in the video was of joy, only the “non-lonely” group automatically smiled in response. The participants’ scores on depression and on extraversion bore no relation to this finding. It was loneliness that made the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers checked that the lonely group could deliberately mimic smiles, as well as frowns (which they could). They also found that the lonely group smiled automatically while viewing “non-social” positive images (such as nature scenes) that also made the other group smile. These images didn’t include people (or if they did, their facial expressions weren’t obvious.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that a failure to mimic other people’s smiles automatically could be playing a role in loneliness. A failure to mimic a smile might send an antisocial signal to others, the researchers note, undermining social connections, and leading to social <i>dis</i>connect. “Indeed, this could be one behavioural mechanism that maintains chronic loneliness,” they add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is a small study, and it can’t speak to the causal direction: does loneliness lead to a problem with smile mimicry or is it the other way around? But it does suggest a new target for addressing loneliness, and for further research into the role it might potentially play in real-world encounters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Given the serious problem of loneliness in society and its danger to health, more research on how it presents in everyday social interactions is useful for greater understanding of and treatment of the condition, ourselves and each other,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life <em>in </em>those years?</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?</h2>
<p>“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.</p>
<p>The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367"><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.</p>
<p>“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.</p>
<p>As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.</p>
<h2>The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease</h2>
<p>Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another longevity project, the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.</p>
<p>Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.</p>
<h2>Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.</h2>
<p>Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live <em>with</em> illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.</p>
<p>It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.</p>
<p>Regardless of their age, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289">research</a> indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?</h2>
<p>In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.</p>
<p>Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p>The older you get the happier you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159"><em>The emotion paradox in the aging brain</em></a>, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.</p>
<blockquote><p>When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.</p>

Likewise, in Europe, 91 companies have been fined for lapses in data privacy since the GDPR data privacy regulation took effect in May 2018.</span></li></ul></div>

<p>There are many reasons why media outlets report scientifically misleading information. But one key site at which this sort of misunderstanding takes root is in the press releases that universities issue when one of their researchers has published something that has a chance of garnering some attention. A <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1324-7">new open-access study in BMC Medicine</a> attempts to change this by intervening in the process directly.</p>

<p>Press releases are often misleading in many different ways, but a common flaw is their <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/21/how-much-are-readers-misled-by-headlines-that-imply-correlational-findings-are-causal/">tendency to confuse causal and correlational claims</a>. That is, an observational study will find that (to take a hypothetical), the more wine people drink, the more likely they are to be diagnosed with cancer over a given period. A study like this, reported accurately, doesn’t show that drinking wine <i>causes</i> cancer – it shows that wine consumption is <i>associated with </i>cancer diagnoses. It could be some other factor or factors is/are responsible for the link, like maybe people who drink more wine engage in other behaviours that <i>themselves</i> increase the risk of cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Experimental studies, on the other hand, allow for the more confident drawing of causal inferences. If (again hypothetically) you took two otherwise equivalent groups, assigned one to make no lifestyle changes other than beginning to drink more wine, and then tracked differences in long-term cancer diagnoses, it’s more likely any observed group differences were caused by the experimental intervention.</p>
<p>The way that health press releases often present purely correlational evidence as though it is causal is, to an extent, understandable: “Wine Causes Cancer” is more eye-catching than “Researchers Uncover A Correlation Between Wine Consumption And Cancer That May Or May Not Be Causal.” And because journalists often write stories based entirely on press releases, the end result is that news coverage often lacks nuance.</p>
<p>For the new research, a team of psychologists led by Rachel Adams at Cardiff University and including her colleague Christopher Chambers, the author of “The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology: A Manifesto for Reforming the Culture of Scientific Practice”, asked a bunch of university press offices to participate. The press offices sent the team hundreds of their biomedical and health-related press releases before they went out to the public, and Chambers and his colleagues randomly assigned them to different conditions: some they didn’t touch regardless of their contents or accuracy (the control group), whereas for the others they proposed edits that “aligned” the press release’s headline and content with the nature of the evidence (with experimental evidence allowing for stronger causal claims, and purely correlational evidence presented with cautious language). Then they watched the press releases go into the wild, evaluating how often their more careful approach was carried over into any ensuing national and international press stories – and whether the toned down releases led to less media coverage.</p>
<p>The most important takeaways are that news headlines were more accurate when they were written off more accurate press releases (which shows that journalists really are relying heavily on press releases rather than reading the studies themselves). And as judged by the amount of media coverage each press release generated, there was “no evidence of reduced news uptake for press releases whose headlines and main claims aligned to evidence.” Now, press releases should be accurate for accuracy’s own sake, but this does offer some evidence that honest press-release writers won’t be punished, in terms of reduced media coverage, by doing the right thing. This suggests, as Chambers and his team write in their abstract, that “[c]autious claims and explicit caveats about correlational findings may penetrate into news without harming news interest.”</p>
<p>As the research team further point out, what this study can’t answer is the actual effect of misleading versus appropriately hedged media coverage on news consumers themselves – that is, will their behaviour change on the basis of whether or not they are reading accurate health coverage? That’s a question for future research.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating and important to conduct a study like this on press releases related to psychological findings – another area where it’s been fairly standard <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/08/tetris-related-science-reporting-failure.html">for a while</a> for weak or conflicting findings to be presented in a much stronger, more attention-getting manner in press releases, potentially causing harm to readers.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<h2>When does old age begin?</h2>
<p>We can’t seem to make up our minds, and the older we get, the further we move the goalposts marking the last season of our lives.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/06/29/growing-old-in-america-expectations-vs-reality/">2009 survey</a> of Americans asked participants when they believed someone grew ‘old’.</p>
<p>Young folks in their twenties believed said old age began at 60. Those under 50 put the threshold closer to 70, whereas those 65 and above said that the average person does not become old until turning 74.</p>
<p>Getting old wasn’t nearly as bad as people think it will be. Nor was it quite as good.</p>
<p>On the downside, one in four adults ages 65 surveyed reported memory loss. One in five had a serious illness, are no longer sexually active, or often feel sad or depressed, lonely or have trouble paying bills. One in ten felt like a burden.</p>
<p>On the upside, the same group said they have more time for hobbies, travel, volunteer work, and more financial security. Of all the good things about getting old, the best by far, according to older adults, is being able to spend more time with family members.</p>
<h2>“Am I Old? Certainly not!”</h2>
<p>One of my boys said to me recently he couldn’t imagine me as a little girl and how did it feel to finally be “old”. I told him I feel the same now as I did when I was 10.</p>
<p>“Am I Old? Certainly not!” This was the answer survey respondents gave too.</p>
<p>In fact, the older they got, the younger they said they feel. About half of those under 30 said they felt their age. But those who were 75 and older? Just 35% say they feel “old”.</p>
<p>It seems we remain on intimate terms with our much younger selves — I sometimes wonder how ten-year old me suddenly became forty-three?</p>
<h2>We enter the end of our lifespan with our past woven intimately into our biology.</h2>
<p>From birth, our neural architecture is shaped by life’s ups and downs, the decisions we made, the places where we lived, worked and learned, the meaning we’ve derived, and who we loved, gave life to, and travelled with through time. How we spend our early years will determine how we age.</p>
<p>More and more of us are living to into old age, and there has never been a better time in which to do so. Our large clever human brains have bequeathed us with modern medicine and tools with which we manage our reproductive health, avoid maternal and neonatal death, vaccinate against disease, prevent pain, treat infection and some cancers, and perform surgery if required.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, women lived barely long enough to see out their 50s. A baby girl born today can expect to live to see out the first decades of the 22<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the secrets of exceptional longevity</h2>
<p>On February 21, 1875, one year before the Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, cinema, and on a trip to Paris saw the Eiffel tower being built. When she was 13, Jeanne met Vincent Van Gogh; although apparently, she was less than impressed saying he was ”…very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick…”.</p>
<p>In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf, and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and “alert as a hummingbird” till the end. The French called her “la doyenne de l’humanitè” (the elder of humankind) and she still holds <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11520-2_16">the record</a> for the world’s longest ever living human (although this has been recently <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/">challenged</a>).</p>
<p>In April 2017, the latest longevity record holder, Emma Martina Luigia Morano of Vercelli, Italy, died aged 117. Born in November 1899, Morano was the last known living person who was born in the 1800s. According to the Guinness Book of Records, Morano followed the same extraordinary diet for around 90 years: three eggs per day (two raw, one cooked), fresh Italian pasta, and a dish of raw meat. The current longevity crown belongs to Polish Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal, who celebrated his 113th birthday in September 2017.</p>
<h2>Once rare as diamonds, the oldest of the old are the fastest growing sector of our global population.</h2>
<p>If you were born in 1900, the odds of living till age 100 were less than 1 in a million, and few people lived long enough see out the 1950s. For girls born into wealthy countries today, the odds of blowing out 100 candles on a cake are roughly 1 in 50.</p>
<p>Israel Kristal claims he doesn’t know the secret of his long life.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that everything is determined from above and we shall never know the reasons why. There have been smarter, stronger and better-looking men then me who are no longer alive. All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked her secrets, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that … I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes. Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hard work, raw eggs, biking, and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wait. For death and journalists.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Blue Zones lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>In another longevity project, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner together Professor Michel Poulain famously described five ‘<a href="https://www.bluezones.com/">Blue Zones</a>’ around the globe where the residents live to exceptional old age. Despite being very different parts of the world, there are commonalities to the resident’s lifestyles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their longevity has nothing to do with brute discipline, diets, exercise programs or supplements… In Blue Zones areas around the world, longevity happens to people. It’s the result of the right environment that constantly nudges them into moving more, eating more plants and beans while eating less meat and sugar, socializing with the right people and living out their values. It’s that simple, really.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Residents of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, prioritise friendship and family, and they almost never work extra hours if it means they have to forego a good party. They also foster ‘plan de vida’ or ‘a reason to live’.</li>
<li>In Loma Linda, California, the strong sense of purpose, day of rest, no-smoking policy, and healthy diet practices of the local Seventh Day Adventist community has rubbed off on the health of the whole town.</li>
<li>Residents of the mountainous villages of Sardinia, Italy and the Greek island of Ikaria, nap, fast, grow their own food, and drink wine daily with friends. It’s thought the clean air, warm breezes and rugged terrain of the Mediterranean islands draw locals outdoors to move naturally.</li>
<li>The residents of the Japanese islands of Okinawa, home to the world’s longest living women, are dedicated to family. Okinawans practice ‘Hara hachi bu’, a reminder to stop eating when they’re 80% full, ‘Ikigai’, which roughly translates to “Why I wake up in the morning,” and form ‘Moais’, groups of five friends that remain committed to each other for live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buettner has distilled the lifestyle practices of Blue Zones into lessons for longevity. As he says, to make it to 100 you may have to “win the genetic lottery”, but the average person’s life expectancy can be increased by moving move, prioritising friends, family and social gatherings, eating less, drinking wine, and fostering a sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Sydney Centenarian Study lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>Due to the rarity of extremely old folks, the <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/research-projects/sydney-centenarian-study">Sydney Centenarian Study</a> has partnered with a consortium of centenarian research teams from around the globe to pool their resources and data to enable more powerful conclusions to be drawn. Their data support the Blue Zones observations.</p>
<p>Charlene Levitan, who once headed up the Sydney Centenarian Study says,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is emerging from the global research is that around 30% of longevity is contributed by genetics. The remaining 70% is to do with our lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, exercise, and remaining socially integrated.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest themes to emerge is related to the personality traits of resilience, adaptability and optimism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of our centenarians will report optimism as a life-long personality characteristic.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have healthy vision, there will be a specific region of your brain (in the visual cortex) that responds most strongly whenever you look at faces, and similar regions that are especially responsive to the sight of words or natural scenes. What’s more, in any two people, these face, word and scene regions are located in pretty much the same spot in the brain. However, there is not a specific region for every possible category of visible stimulus – there are no “car” or “shoe” regions, for example (at least, not that have been identified to date). Is that because childhood experience is critical for training the visual cortex – we spend a lot of time looking at faces, say, but not cars? And, if so, in theory, could a lot of childhood time spent looking at a different type of object generate its own dedicated, individual category region?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The answer is “yes”, at least according to an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8">ingenious study</a>, published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour, </i>of people who played a Pokémon game for years of their childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37328"></span></p>
<p>Jesse Gomez led the new study while a graduate student at Stanford University. He was looking for a way to test whether there’s a critical developmental window for the formation of dedicated category regions in the human visual cortex, just as there is in macaque monkeys. He needed a kind of visual stimulus that some adults had been exposed to intensively in childhood but others had not. He thought of how, from about the age of six, he, like many other kids he knew, used to spend countless hours playing a game on his Nintendo Game Boy called Pokémon Red and Blue. It involved identifying hundreds of different Pokémon characters, which look a bit like animals or mythical beasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez realised that if he could find other people who had also started playing the game intensively at about the same age, using the same device, he could explore whether this had influenced the organisation of their visual cortex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He managed to recruit 11 such adults (including himself), and scanned their brains while they were shown images of Pokémon characters, as well as other things, such as faces, corridors and cartoons. Gomez and his colleagues found that within the visual cortex (in the ventral temporal region) of the Pokémon experts, there was a discrete area that was most active when looking at the Pokémon characters. There was no such region in a control group of non-players.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other work has found that the brains of people who become experts at recognising a type of object (like cars) as an adult respond differently to those objects than the brains of novices. But these differences are not in the visual cortex; they’re more often in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attention and decision-making rather than basic visual processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on the work showing the plasticity of the visual cortex in young macaques, “the current finding of a Pokémon-preferring brain region really drives home just how amazing the plasticity of our developing visual system is,” write Daniel Janini and Talia Konkle of Harvard University in a news comment on the paper, published in the same issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez and his colleagues also found that – as with face-processing or word-processing regions – the “Pokemon region” shared a similar location in all of the experts’ brains. They think that the physical size of an object’s image on the retina is important in determining where, in the brain, the category region forms. The image size of a Pokémon character viewed on an old Game Boy screen by children is consistently smaller than that of someone’s face – and a lot smaller than that of a landscape, for instance – which could have a lasting effect on the way visual representations are handled in the adult brain, the researchers think.</p>
<p>As well as being fascinating, the study has potentially important practical implications. “Our data raise the possibility that if people do not share common visual experiences of a stimulus during childhood, either from disease, as is the case in cataracts, or cultural differences in viewing patterns, then an atypical or unique representation of that stimulus may result in adulthood, which has important implications for learning disabilities and social disabilities,” the researchers write. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Consider autism, for example, which is associated with difficulties recognising faces and an aversion to eye contact. If kids with autism grow up looking at faces differently from how most children do, perhaps this explains the <a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/ffa-fusiform-facial-area-neurons-autism-recognition/">observed deficits</a> in the function of the face-sensitive region of their visual cortex, and in turn this could contribute to the social difficulties that autistic children experience. If this account is correct, then finding out how long the window of visual cortical plasticity lasts will be critical for designing effective interventions for autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

How do we do it? For starters, our press team sends out on average one press release per day, garnering the attention of the 1200 journalists on our press list, plus members of the media who haven’t heard of us yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for us to make sure your research gets the recognition it deserves from other researchers, potential funders, and policy makers, our dedicated media team also leverages a robust network of partnerships to connect science and the media. </span></p>
<p><b>Science for non-scientists</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though all PLOS research is Open and accessible to everyone, many readers depend on journalists to distill complex scientific concepts for broader consumption. An important link in the transformation of Research Article to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NY Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cover story are Science Media Centers (SMCs) which work with journalists to get the public access to the best scientific evidence and expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through SMCs, journalists can find “sources” or vetted experts in a given field to help add context to the research they’re reporting on. Some SMCs, such as </span><a href="https://www.sciline.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SciLine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also offer </span><a href="https://www.sciline.org/evidence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fact sheets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> summarizing popular topics that have been reviewed and verified by experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working with SMCs in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany for over a year, for example by providing information that helps SMCs spread the word about PLOS work even further. In Europe, we also collaborate with the</span><a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> European Science Media Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, part of the European Parliament, whose work helps facilitate the transfer of knowledge and training between the European Parliament, the scientific community, and the media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partnership with these organizations is also helping us to shape best practice for communicating research, especially for new scholarly outputs like preprints. </span></p>
<p><b>Leveraging your network and your expertise</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the best place to seek promotion and recognition for your work is your own institution. Already, we work with top-tier institutions such as MIT, Harvard University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, the National Institutes of Health and more to help them promote the amazing research being done by their affiliated PLOS authors. We’re hoping to expand this program further, but even without formal partnership, we encourage all authors to contact their institution’s press office when their research is accepted for publication – your colleagues’ networks can be a huge asset to your career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For authors who are keen to be hands-on in disseminating research, we also recommend contacting our partner </span><a href="https://sciencetrends.com/feature-your-research-on-science-trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This free platform allows authors to write their own “self-directed press release” in under 500 words which is then published on Science Trends and on social media to an audience of 500,000 followers. You can find more information on our </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/press-and-media#loc-talking-about-research-under-embargo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re dedicated to providing the best experience for our authors, pre and post-publication. We’ll continue innovating and promoting your work and we want you to feel empowered to do so as well. Check out our </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/media-toolkit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">media toolkit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for tips on publicizing your work, speaking to the media, and stepping up your social media game.

<h4>How brains learn diseases, and their cures</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/1*slNjzwmTKuHo03_bW86V-Q.png" /></figure><p>My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.</p><p>Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are <em>cells</em>, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.</p><p>Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-to-unlearn-a-disease">epileptic patients report</a> that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-dostoevsky-epilepsy-was-a-matter-of-both-life-and-literature">aura</a>’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.</p><p>SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012372">Rivlin et al., 2013</a>). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517513/">Giaccia, Simon, &amp; Johnson, 2004</a>). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705794">Kemp &amp; Peers, 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728482/">Nei, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821532/">Richerson, 2010</a>). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897710">P-Codrea, et al., 2005</a>), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468748">Takano et al., 2007</a>). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.</p><p>The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one <em>learned</em> by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.</p><p>The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol><li>Interestingly, SUDEP is more prevalent among males, and males tend to be more sensitive to hypoxia, suffering worse outcomes. This has been found true both in clinical studies and in studies involving multiple animal models (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474588">Hill &amp; Fitch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542909">Mayoral, Omar, &amp; Penn, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889641">Mirza, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149081">Pérez-Crespo et al., 2005</a>). This sexual dimorphism may be due, in part, to the gene G6PD, an X-linked gene related to oxidative stress, which has been implicated in hypoxia-induced damage (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063801">Chettimada et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225644">Gao, L., et al., 2004</a>). It’s also worth noting that in a rodent model, sleep apnea-induced plasticity of the breathing circuit was normalized with antioxidant treatment, which may similarly show a protective effect in high SUDEP risk patients. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress may play an important role in detecting and preventing SUDEP.</li><li>Some researchers believe that SUDEP is related to another medical mystery, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the best known risk factors for SIDS is prenatal nicotine exposure, and nicotine exposure is known to alter receptor expression in oxygen-sensing neural circuits; therefore both diseases may result from plasticity of the brain areas responsible for controlling breathing.</li><li>SUDEP has also been associated with a variety of genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as well as several anti-convulsive drugs that also make patients prone to arrhythmias (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372310">Klassen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989471/">Glasscock, 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>). However, genes do not deterministically dictate SUDEP risk. Given that genetic tests are costly, and only suggestive of susceptibility, a functional measurement such as apnea would likely be a more effective biomarker.</li></ol><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ced1cb1b3545" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/thoughts-on-a-medical-mystery-ced1cb1b3545">Thoughts on a medical mystery</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You should take just under two-and-a-half minutes to finish reading this blog post. That’s going by the findings of a new review, which has looked at almost 200 studies of reading rates published over the past century to come up with an overall estimate for how quickly we read. And it turns out that that rate is considerably slower than commonly thought.</p>
<p>Of the various estimates of average reading speed bandied around over the years, one of the most commonly cited is 300 words per minute (wpm). However, a number of findings of slower reading rates challenge that statistic, notes Marc Brysbaert from Ghent University in Belgium in his new paper <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/">released as a preprint on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37321"></span></p>
<p>Brysbaert searched for all studies measuring reading rates in participants aged between 17 and 60 and in languages that use the Latin alphabet. The exact nature of the studies varied a lot: for example, in some, participants had to read a long passage before answering multiple choice questions about the text, while in others they read single sentences while their eye movements were measured. But Brysbaert included only those studies in which participants read for fun or comprehension, and excluded others that require memorization or other challenges. Altogether, he found 190 suitable studies conducted between 1901 and 2019, collectively involving 17,887 participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The average reading rate across all these studies turned out to be just 238 wpm – much slower than the popular 300 wpm estimate. However, there was quite a lot of variability between studies, particularly those that used very short passages, where the slowest rate was just over 100 wpm and the fastest nearly 400 wpm. With longer texts, the rates fell more closely around the average, suggesting that longer reading tasks might be a more reliable measure.</p>
<p>Although the number of studies involving non-English languages was too small to draw any firm conclusions, there seemed to be a hint of differences between languages. For example, reading rate in the five Spanish studies was considerably faster than the average, at 278 wpm, while the average rate for the 144 English-only studies was 236 wpm. And while the meta-analysis only included participants under the age of 60, Brysbaert notes that other studies have found that reading rate declines in older age groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Knowing that reading rates are closer to 240 than 300 wpm might seem fairly inconsequential. But it does have real-world implications. These kinds of thresholds are used by educators to determine whether someone is a slow reader and in need of remedial help – so honing in on a precise number is important. “Setting the target reading rate at 300 wpm is unrealistic for the majority of people and likely to result in disappointment of what can be achieved,” writes Brysbaert.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis of past reading-rate estimates is arguably the most interesting part of the new preprint – but in fact the manuscript encompasses a lot more. If you want to find out more about the long history of reading research<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or what the fastest possible reading speed is, go and have a look at the paper. But set aside some time: at more than 19,000 words long, it will take you about 80 minutes to get through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Picture in your mind a futuristic, technologically enhanced human. Perhaps you imagined them with a subcutaneous device in their arm for phone calls and browsing the internet. Maybe they are wearing smart glasses for augmented reality. What I’d wager you didn’t think of is the presence of an artificial sixth digit attached to each hand. However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10306-w">a breakthrough open-access study in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> – the first to study the physiology and sensorimotor mechanics of polydactyly volunteers (people born with extra fingers) – shows the feasibility and practical advantages that would be gained from such an extra appendage. The results also have implications for the medical treatment of polydactyl people, who often have their extra finger removed at birth on the presumption that it will be of no benefit to them.</p>
<p><span id="more-37317"></span></p>
<p>Carsten Mehring and his colleagues conducted various tests with two polydactyly volunteers, a 17-year-old boy and his mother, both born with an extra fully formed finger between their thumb and index finger (known as preaxial polydactyly). The researchers note that polydactyly is “not rare”, with an incidence of around 0.2 per cent in the population. However, fully formed preaxial polydactyly is a rarer subset of that group.</p>
<p>Using MRI of the volunteers’ hands, the researchers established that the extra finger has a saddle joint, similar to a typical thumb, and that it is innervated by its own dedicated nerves. Further tests established that the volunteers had independent control of their extra finger and that they were able to use it to perform a pinch grip with each of their other fingers.</p>
<p>An MRI of the volunteers’ brains further showed that the extra finger was represented in the brain independently of the other fingers. Another test, that involved concealing the extra finger and asking the volunteers’ to identify landmarks on it, showed that they had an accurate mental representation of their extra digit.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers used video motion capture to observe the volunteers manipulating various objects. This showed that the volunteers engaged in a “rich ensemble of movement patterns” and that they frequently used their extra finger in coordination with both their thumb and index finger (it was not simply used as a substitute for these digits). “Taken together these results demonstrate that the movements of the six fingers of our two subjects had increased complexity relative to common five-fingered hands,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>But do these extra movement capabilities provide any functional advantage? Mehring and his team devised a video game that required coordinating key presses to respond to six boxes oscillating progressively faster up and down onscreen. A different key press was required to respond to each of the six boxes, so people with normal five-fingered hands would need two hands to succeed at the task, the researchers note. Critically, the polydactyl volunteers were able to achieve the same impressive game performance with one hand as with two.</p>
<p>Neuroscience and psychology have studied extensively the profound neural consequences for humans of losing a limb or other appendage, including documenting the pain caused by the phantom limb effect (usually explained as due to reorganisation of the brain’s representation of missing part). However, this new study represents the first neuroscientific exploration of having an extra body part, finding “… that the human nervous system is able to develop, embody and control multiple extra degrees of freedom and integrate them into coordinated movements with the other limbs, without any apparent deficits or conflicts in the sensorimotor or mental representations.”</p>
<p>This has immediate implications for the medical response to polydactyl, suggesting the need to “…thoroughly evaluate the functionality of [the extra digit] in polydactyl infants before deciding whether to remove it.” Also, from a cyborg perspective, the results “…suggest that it may be of value to augment normal five-fingered hands with an artificial supernumerary finger,” the researchers said. In fact this new research paves the wave for an entire new research endeavor. “Polydactyl individuals with functional [extra fingers] offer a unique opportunity to investigate the neural control of supernumerary limbs, analyse internal representations of body and the limits of sensorimotor capabilities in humans.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/602950398/0/oupblogpsychology/">When narcolepsy makes you more creative</a></h4>

<p>At night, the surrealist poet Saint-Pol-Roux used to hang a sign on his bedroom’s door that read: “Do not disturb: poet at work.” Indeed, may sleep increase our creativity? The link between creativity and sleep has been a topic of intense speculation, mainly based on anecdotal reports of artistic and scientific discoveries people have made while dreaming. Dmitri Mendeleev supposedly came up with the arrangement that became the periodic table while asleep. Yet, scientific proof of such a relationship remains scarce. To investigate the long-term effect of sleep on creativity, clinicians and scientists from Sorbonne University, Paris, France, and Bologna University, Italy, called upon experts of sleep and dreams: patients with narcolepsy.</p><p>Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder characterised by uncontrolled sleep attacks. These naps are special, as they often start immediately with a specific sleep stage named rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas healthy subjects need to sleep for roughly one hour before entering REM sleep. Therefore, patients with narcolepsy have a swift access to REM sleep, a stage associated with robust dreaming activity. They also present many symptoms showing that the boundary between wakefulness and REM sleep is blurry. For example, most narcolepsy patients are lucid dreamers, meaning that they are conscious of dreaming while dreaming, to the point of sometimes having control over their dreams. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130">It has also been shown that naps containing REM sleep are followed by a period of increased mental flexibility, in turn favouring problem solving</a>. Given their life-long privileged access to REM sleep and dreams, may patients with narcolepsy have developed over time higher creative abilities than average?</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awz137">To answer this question, the authors compared the creative abilities of patients with narcolepsy with healthy subjects</a>. Defining and measuring creativity is not an easy task. In this research field, creativity is commonly defined as the ability to produce work that is both original and adapted to constraints. In order to obtain a picture of creativity as detailed and complete as possible, the authors asked participants to complete various tasks.</p><p>First, 185 patients with narcolepsy and 126 healthy subjects completed two questionnaires on creativity. The first questionnaire explores your creative profile and score, through 57 questions, and concludes whether one is innovative, imaginative, or a researcher.  Then, in the second questionnaire subjects report creative achievements (from being a complete beginner to being a national star) in various domains of arts and sciences, including writing, theatre/film, humour, inventions, or culinary arts. The results of these two questionnaires provide a subjective measure of creativity. Next, researchers tested the creative performances of 30 patients with narcolepsy and 30 healthy subjects during a face-to-face two-hour long test of creativity, named the Evaluation of Creative Potential. The divergent-exploratory thinking, a thought process used to generate creative ideas, was tested by finding the greatest number of solutions to a problem (e.g., “Invent the maximum of shapes using two triangles”). The convergent-integrative thinking, the ability to give the correct answer to questions that do not require significant creativity, was tested by combing several elements into a coherent pattern (e.g., drawings a scene based on seven shapes, or writing a story that includes an animal, an old man, the suburb and three cars).</p><p>Globally, subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher creative scores than the healthy subjects, for both the subjective and the objective measures, and in all forms of creative profiles. Most symptoms of narcolepsy (sleepiness, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, but not treatments) were also associated with higher scores of creativity.</p><p>This increased creativity may be a result of more frequent opportunities for patients with narcolepsy to incubate ideas during daytime naps (with REM sleep). Moreover, the high dream recall frequency observed in narcolepsy may also provide them with a high pool of inspiring new ideas.</p><p>For the first time, an increased creativity is demonstrated in subjects with narcolepsy, providing a silver lining to this disastrous disease. These young adults are often considered lazy, but it appears their proficient lucid dreaming and creative abilities may help researchers better understand the role of dreaming in everyone’s life.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Grayscale photo of sleeping woman lying on bed” by Kinga Cichewicz.

This study shows that running on the ground naturally stimulates a flapping motion in feathered forelimbs, and suggests that this flap may be the origin of avian flight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Zhao explains: “Our work shows that the motion of flapping feathered wings was developed passively and naturally as the dinosaur ran on the ground…although this flapping motion could not lift the dinosaur into the air at that time, the motion of flapping wings may have developed earlier than gliding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from PLOS ONE found that that in a test room set to temperatures ranging from 16.19 C/61.14 F -32.57 C/90.63 F, female study participants performed best on math and verbal tests at the higher end of the temperature range, while male participants performed most strongly on the same tests at lower temperatures. This is the first experimental research supporting anecdotal and survey responses indicating women tend to prefer warmer room temperatures than men, by showing that temperatures can affect both comfort and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors Kajackaite and Chang summarize: “In a large laboratory experiment, over 500 individuals performed a set of cognitive tasks at randomly manipulated indoor temperatures. Consistent with their preferences for temperature, for both math and verbal tasks, women perform better at higher temperatures while men perform better at lower temperatures.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along a similar vein(!), new </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002805"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from PLOS Medicine shows that the medical care received by heart failure patients in the UK may have important gaps around diagnoses, insufficient follow-up after hospitalisation, and improperly-prescribed dosages, among other issues; these problems significantly affected women and older people.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2016 mass die-off of puffins and other seabirds in the Bering Sea is reported in a new PLOS ONE </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216532"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Timothy Jones of the citizen science program COASST at University of Washington, Lauren Divine from the Aleut Community of St Paul Island Ecosystem Conservation Office, and colleagues. Up to 8,500 puffins and auklets may have died in this event, which appeared to be due to starvation; the authors suggest that climate shifts may have resulted in a lack of prey.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in lighter news, a new </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215444"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from PLOS ONE showed that wolves behave more prosocially towards their fellow pack mates than do pack dogs during a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">touchscreen-based task that allowed individual animals to provide food to others–though the study did not look at the behavior of pet dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Rachel Dale notes: “This study shows that domestication did not necessarily make dogs more prosocial. Rather, it seems that tolerance and generosity towards group members help to produce high levels of cooperation, as seen in wolves.” </span></p>

While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Heeded and acted upon?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication.

Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003.

The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis?

In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – </span><span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">the oligopoly</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (</span><span><a href="https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;Src=IP&amp;Alias=WOK5">Web of Science</a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: black;"> </span></span><span style="color: black;">and <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a></span><span style="color: black;">) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities.

The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA.

Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina.

We hope that the feedback phase has been useful, and that cOAlition S will adjust their strategy to enable an inclusive, participative open access model to be developed, one in which non-profit scholarly communication is taken into account when financial resources are distributed.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>If they don’t, Plan S will only further weaken those publishing activities that are still in the control of the academy, and strengthen commercial publishers – to the point perhaps where the former will disappear altogether. </span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>AmeliCA’s goals are crystal clear: we want scholarly publishing to be in the hands of the academy – universities and professional associations. In other words, to continue working in the way that Redalyc has been working for decades.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: The wording of the São Paulo Statement is very general and does not specify much in the way of practical action. As you will know, cOAlition S has been struggling to get global buy-in for Plan S, and has attracted criticism in the Global South for attempting to foist a one-size-fits-all Eurocentric model (as you call it) of scholarly publishing on the world. I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement? What benefits do you think signing it might bring to the Global South?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> Scholarly publishing is a global ecosystem that already exists.

Every stakeholder agrees with this other than those who benefit from the way things currently are. The only point of disagreement, as I said, is over how open access is achieved.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>In the South, Redalyc, AmeliCA, CLACSO, <a href="https://www.latindex.org/latindex/inicio">Latindex</a></span><span><span style="color: black;">, and <a href="http://www.lareferencia.info/en/">LaReferencia</a></span><span style="color: black;"> (amongst others) have <a href="http://reuniondeconsorcios.conricyt.mx/index.php/primera-reunion/declaraciones/?lang=en">expressed their strong objection</a></span><span style="color: black;"> to the APC model. And I expressed this clearly and vehemently at São Paolo, so I hope that the final implementation guidelines will demonstrate that cOAlition S has listened to the feedback it has received and is prepared to provide resources for non-profit players. Here I am thinking of non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools. If this happens then our engaging with cOAlition S will have led to something positive.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And if Plan S ends up dismantling the current harmful system for evaluating research and researchers based on the false prestige bestowed on publications by the Impact Factor – as called for by the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a>)</span><span><span style="color: black;"> – there is no doubt that the South would benefit.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As to any PR benefits the São Paulo Statement may have: I wouldn’t like to think the meeting was only undertaken for media purposes. In signing the statement, we wanted to give a vote of confidence to the notion that communication and feedback between the North and South is a good thing. Plan S and the general public know AmeliCA’s principles and values. We unwaveringly affirm them and will keep working towards them.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: I believe AmeliCA plans to publish a public response to the São Paulo Statement.

                <h4><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html">Why did Riksbankens Jubileumsfond decide to leave cOAlition S?</a></h4>

<span>Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>Plan S</span></a><span>. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.</span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Simeon87 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG">CC BY-SA</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><br /><span></span><span>Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home">a petition</a> of protest being launched. <span>  </span></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/">revised guidelines</a> last week (31st May). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “</span><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s"><span>welcomed</span></a><span>” them, as </span><a href="http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/"><span>have</span></a><span> open access advocates.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were </span><a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/"><span>10 funders</span></a><span>; today there are still only </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>19</span></a><span>. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the </span><a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php"><span>two largest producers of research papers in the world</span></a><span> – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.</span><br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en"><span>RJ</span></a><span>) to leave the coalition. RJ</span><span>’</span><span>s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>How, when and why did RJ leave?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 6<sup>th</sup> March RJ published </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an open letter</span></a><span> addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Leave or remain?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day (7<sup>th</sup> March) RJ posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20"><span>tweet</span></a><span> saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/"><span>a note</span></a><span> on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (</span><span>May 28</span><sup>th</sup><span>) RJ </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that it had left the coalition.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Confusingly, although the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6<sup>th</sup>, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7<sup>th</sup> March.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin">Marika Hedin</a>. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1<sup>st</sup> February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “</span><span>No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Evolved</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6<sup>th</sup>letter. It is also</span><span> not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">10 Plan S Principles</a><span>– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More puzzling perhaps, the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>When I </span><span>asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and </span><a href="https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/"><span>Head of Open Research</span></a><span>at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31<sup>st</sup> May).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? </span><span>“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until <i>after</i> the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;A. She replied, “</span><span>Thank you, but I have no further comments.</span><span>After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Openness and transparency</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm.

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</a></h4>

<p>There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">critique of the neural coding metaphor</a>, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a <em>primary</em> representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a <em>secondary</em> representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/">Mark Bickhard</a>.</p>
<p>The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">subjective physics</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural coding essay</a>, and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">in my response to commentaries</a> (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/">problematic aspects</a> with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.</p>
<p>With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons <em>is</em> the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.</p>

If you delve into the wildest depths of the scientific literature, you will find a trilogy of papers so weird, that they have become legendary.



In these articles, spanning a 12 year period, author Jarl Flensmark says that heeled shoes cause mental illness, while flat footwear promotes brain health:

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/cMZuq99n1yk/">Looking Good: Tips for creating your PLOS figures graphics</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/art-color-color-palette-159560-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Enhance your research with tips and tools from the experts on the PLOS Production Team. This post is part of our new Format for Success series where we’ll share advice for generating figures and graphics that make submitting a breeze. Stay tuned for more. </em></p>
<p>We know that preparing graphics files can be one of the most challenging parts of submitting your hard work to a publisher, when you would rather be observing in the field, experimenting in the lab, or conversing with the community. Like you, we want your research to shine and be noticed by your peers, adding to the scientific discourse and fostering collaboration in and across disciplines.</p>
<p>To help you create the best images possible and ensure a smooth article production experience, we’ve put together our top tips, distilled to a few major areas, for assessing your graphics files during submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider raster images vs vector images</strong> – <em>Raster images</em> are made of pixels. A pixel is a single point or the smallest single element in a display device. <em>Vector images</em> are mathematical calculations from one point to another that form lines and shapes, which adjust to fit a monitor display and zoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our journal article pages use raster graphics for in-article figure display, the lightbox figure viewer, and carousel thumbnails.  Raster graphics are easier to create, store, and transfer across platforms, but limit resolution to 600 dpi. Alternatively, vector graphics are only available in the article PDF accessed online, but will result in a more detailed image at high zoom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a resolution between 300 and 600 dpi</strong> – Effective resolutions below 300 dpi (dots/pixels per inch) often result in a blurry, jagged or pixelated image that is not optimal to publish, and resolutions above 600 dpi frequently must be resized or rescaled. We are required by the PLOS publishing platform, and community indexes like PubMed Central, to ensure content adheres to these resolutions.</li>
<li><strong>Combine multi-panel images</strong> – Often, it’s useful to exhibit a Part A, Part B, and Part C, all within one figure image. To create a multi-paneled figure from individual images, we suggest using a presentation program like PowerPoint, Word or GIMP to arrange your panels, create labels, and scale or size your figures. Multi-paneled figures need to fit into a single page or be broken apart into separate figures in order to publish clearly and accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Flatten image layers</strong> – Unflattened images can incorporate alpha channels, which include a transparent layer potentially containing “junk”, “artifacts”. Sometimes, an unflattened image can also render a figure into a complete black or white rectangle, obscuring all your content. We recommend that you flatten your graphics to combine all the layers into a single background layer, so we can ensure the quality of the output equals your intent.</li>
<li><strong>Compress file size with LZW compression</strong> – Data compression helps to reduce file size and also decreases time required to download and upload content. With compressed files, we can help you reduce the size of your article PDF, improving a researcher’s ability to access your work and send it to colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using PACE</strong></p>
<p>To help you assess your figure images, PLOS also offers authors a free, web-based imaging review tool, <a href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">PACE</a>, that evaluates figures against our platform requirements and fixes the most-common image issues, detailing any changes made, or informs the user what outstanding issues may exist.  PACE compiles two, online review options in the form of typeset page mockups to give users an idea of how the uploaded image would appear in the final article. To use PACE, simply register with your email address: <a href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to undertaking a scientific protocol, PLOS’s production team follows specific rules to ensure that the accepted content is correctly transformed to XML and PDF in order to publish accurately in our journal sites and syndication targets. In short, graphic images must generally conform to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>File format</em> – TIFF or EPS</li>
<li><em>Dimensions</em> – Width: 789 – 2250 pixels (at 300 dpi). Height maximum: 2625 pixels (at 300 dpi).</li>
<li><em>Resolution</em> – 300 – 600 dpi</li>
<li><em>File size</em> – 10MB or under</li>
<li><em>Figure files naming</em> – Fig1.tif, Fig2.eps, and so on. Match file name to caption label and citation.</li>
<li><em>Caption</em> – Place within the manuscript as simple text, not within the figure file</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve posted additional graphics recommendations, as well as instructions for exporting graphics from specialized software, here: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures</a>.</p>
<p>We hope these suggestions make figure preparation even easier so you can spend more time advancing your field and we can publish your work faster than ever.  We encourage you to email us at <a href="mailto:figures@plos.org">figures@plos.org</a> with further questions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/i908V6XekWQ/">PLOS welcomes the revised Plan S guidelines</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a fully Open Access publisher entirely ready to support cOAlition S-funded authors, we have always been in a position to give our support to this bold initiative, and entirely agree that the driving principles and overall objective of Plan S have not been lessened or changed. cOAlition S has clearly listened to constructive suggestions from the community, and there is now enhanced scope for continued community dialogue, alongside the forward momentum. There are a number of revisions which we recognize will make the transition easier for the community, and which clarify or acknowledge other important factors, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Diversity of models underpinning OA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The clarification that neither Plan S nor OA insists on the APC/publication fee model is a key refinement. While this has been a dominant model of OA publishing (including ours) in the Global North, it is absolutely necessary for any OA policies, plans, or mandates to be clear that OA is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcome</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for research, not a single or specific </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">business model</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Commitment to research assessment based on intrinsic merit </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– PLOS is an active member of DORA and appreciates the emphasis on changing the reward and incentive system of research. The OA movement has always operated closely with movements to improve the culture of research, and so we welcome this acknowledgement;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Preprints and peer review</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – PLOS advocates the posting of preprints to accelerate sharing of knowledge and welcomes cOalition S’s  “strong encouragement” for the early sharing of research through preprints while acknowledging that preprint posting alone is not a route to Plan S compliance. The value of high quality peer review as a “significant addition of value to scholarly communication” as emphasized in the Plan S Rationale is recognized at PLOS and was a driver in our move to offer published peer review, giving authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline shift for Plan S implementation to 2021 will be helpful to gain even more community support for the initiative. But we (along with many other publishers) remind the community that PLOS is already 100% Plan S compliant, and our suite of seven journals is available immediately for your cOAlition S-funded work  in most scholarly disciplines relevant to Plan S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS was founded on the principle that scholarly knowledge is a public good. We welcome the bold move of funders aligned behind the fundamental principle that no scholarly publication should be locked behind a paywall. </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9931">A PTSDodgy Genetic Test</a></h4>

A dubious paper just published in Molecular Neurobiology makes the suggestion that all military recruits should be offered genetic testing to assess their risk of PTSD. According to the authors, Kenneth Blum et al.,



We hypothesize that, even before combat, soldiers with a childhood background of violence (or with a familial susceptibility risk) would benefit from being genotyped for high-risk alleles (DNA variants). This process may assist us in identifying potential military candidates who

PLOS is excited to support reagent repositories such as Addgene as yet another step to improve scientific reproducibility. Open access to research findings and the underlying methods, materials and data, and issues surrounding reproducibility, replication, and research waste will be discussed this June 2-5 at the</span></i><a href="http://www.wcri2019.org/index/programme/conference-theme"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 6</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> World Conference on Research Integrity in Hong Kong</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where PLOS ONE’s Senior Editor, Renee Hoch, will present a talk on data availability and image integrity.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without materials and data, there is no research. Barriers to scientific progress can result from something as basic as not having access to reliable, validated information for research materials. That barrier is raised further when scientists cannot obtain samples or data in a timely fashion. Data and material repositories are breaking down these barriers. As a publisher, PLOS is supporting better, more open science by recommending repositories and encouraging use of standardized, unique identifiers </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized depositing of materials advances science in so many ways. It saves authors the time and burden of shipping requested materials. Researchers who request from repositories save time by not having to recreate reagents or wait months or years to receive samples. Many scientists have been on the receiving end of a request that was filled by an incorrect or degraded sample, which further delays research. Repositories like the ones recommended by </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing#loc-sharing-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> handle the logistics of material requests, letting the scientists focus on what’s important: doing research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, repositories make it possible for researchers to get access to different cell lines (</span><a href="http://www.atcc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Type Culture Collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.coriell.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coriell Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), plant materials (</span><a href="https://abrc.osu.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), organisms (</span><a href="https://bdsc.indiana.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://xenopusresource.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Xenopus Resource Centre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.jax.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), plasmids (</span><a href="https://www.addgene.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNASU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/Home.xhtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PlasmID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and many other biological materials. Moreover, many of these repositories provide web-based databases that are easy to search and provide openly available information about each material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For reagent reporting, many repositories also support</span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/unique-and-persistent-plasmid-ids-available-addgene-plasmid-ids-rrids"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unique and persistent identification of reagents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Identifiers like </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it easy for authors to cite materials and improves reporting through standardized identification and a permanent link to information about each reagent. For example, each </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drosophila</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strain at the Bloomington Fly stock Center is assigned a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=BDSC_722&amp;l=BDSC_722"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fly stock RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For mice, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) provides a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=MMRRC_026409-UCD&amp;l=MMRRC_026409-UCD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mouse RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for mutant mouse strains. For plasmids, Addgene will automatically register a </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;l=Addgene_44362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plasmid RRID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon deposit. </span></p>
<p><b>Depositing increases materials transparency and reproducibility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene currently contains over 70,000 unique plasmids and has distributed </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/celebrating-one-million-plasmids-shared"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 1,000,000 plasmids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worldwide since 2004. At Addgene, depositing plasmids is free and straightforward, with the added bonus that it provides quality control measures that contribute to improved reproducibility. Addgene performs full plasmid sequencing and each plasmid is assigned a unique </span><a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/Plasmids/search?q=Addgene_44362&amp;l=Addgene_44362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RRID identifier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with </span><a href="https://www.addgene.org/44362/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a plasmid webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that provides sequence data, cloning information, and associated protocols. This ensures researchers have detailed information about each plasmid reagent. Moreover, each Addgene plasmid page provides an </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/more-data-for-you-find-articles-citing-addgene-plasmids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articles Citing this Plasmid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section which allows researchers to learn how the plasmid was used and validated by different labs.</span></p>
<p><b>Recognition and credit for depositing authors</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depositing materials at the time of publication also provides benefits to both authors and publishers. Depositing authors gain recognition and are cited whenever requestors use the published materials in their own research articles. In fact, data from Addgene supports that depositing published plasmids in Addgene’s repository increases their use and </span><a href="https://blog.addgene.org/addgene-depositors-get-more-citations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results in increased article citations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Deposition at the point of publication also ensures timely distribution of materials. Finally, the information linked to each deposited reagent serves as reliable open data for the materials reported in the publication, simplifying the manuscript-writing process. Overall, PLOS’s support of reagent repositories, follows the publisher’s steps in improving </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data availability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocol sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is a welcome addition for improving materials access and scientific reproducibility.</span></p>
<p><b>New sharing practices will change science for the better</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By encouraging authors to deposit materials at the time of publication, journals will help accelerate research through timely distribution and accurate identification of reagents. Biological repositories exist to serve the scientific community. Take </span><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/crispr.2018.0022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addgene’s involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the explosive advancement of CRISPR research. Since 2012, over 8,400 CRISPR plasmids have been deposited and Addgene has distributed over 144,000 CRISPR plasmids worldwide, enabling researchers to share, modify, and improve this game-changing molecular tool. It is a prime example of the positive impact that biological repositories are making on research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to PLOS’s updated recommendations, the importance of depositing and sharing reagents is finally getting some much-needed recognition. If the positive outcomes of PLOS’s </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data availability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocol sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policies is any indication of what’s in store for open material sharing, the future of science looks bright: speedier, more transparent, and more reproducible research.</span></p>

A paper in a peer-reviewed medical journal makes the suggestion that physicist Stephen Hawking's disability, which famously confined him to a wheelchair and robbed him of his speech, was psychosomatic in nature.



Hmm. I think this says more about the author than it does about Hawking.







The paper is called Delusional Health Beliefs and it comes by British doctor Peter May. It was published a few days ago in the Medico-Legal Journal.







May begins the paper by discussing conversion di
