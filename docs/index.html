                <p>Hello all! I have recently started a new position as an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science at New York University. You can find my lab website here: <a href="https://lindsay-lab.github.io/">lindsay-lab.github.io</a></p>



<p>As you&#8217;ll notice on that site, I have three main intended areas of research: modeling the connection between attention and learning, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07035">validating the tools of systems neuroscience</a>, and applying computer vision to climate change. The first area follows somewhat naturally from <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38105">my PhD work</a>, the second was born out some frustration during my postdoc, and the last &#8230;. well that seems like it&#8217;s really coming out of left field. </p>



<p>I hope to get back into a semi-regular habit of blogging again, and for my first blog post on my new lab website, I decided to explain exactly why my lab will focus on applications to climate change. I&#8217;m cross-posting that piece below, but you can find the original <a href="https://lindsay-lab.github.io/2022/10/18/explaining-myself.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-neural-networks-for-psychology-neuroscience-and-climate-change">“Artificial neural networks for psychology, neuroscience, and climate change”<a href="https://lindsay-lab.github.io/2022/10/18/explaining-myself.html#artificial-neural-networks-for-psychology-neuroscience-and-climate-change"></a></h2>



<p>That’s the tagline on the front page of this website. You may notice that one of those things is not like the others. In this inaugural lab blog post, I’m going to explain why.</p>



<p>At some point during the pandemic, I got really into reading about climate change. It may have been because I had my first kid, though that didn’t feel like the conscious reason. It may have been because Biden got elected and a lot of my other fears washed a way a bit to reveal this one big one. Or maybe it was just a desire to distract myself from one global disaster by focusing on another. Whatever the reason, while I’d had climate change on the backburner of my mind for many years (simmering away as the planet was…), at some point in early 2021, figuring out <a href="https://grist.org/science/time-is-running-out-to-adapt-to-climate-change-new-ipcc-report-says/">just how bad things were going to be</a> became a priority.</p>



<p>And it was devastating and paralyzing.</p>



<p>Once I had really internalized it, I couldn’t stop thinking about the impact of my every move: the temperature I set my home to, every item of food I puchased, any time spent in a car. Simply existing—especially with a small child and all the cheap and disposable items that seem to inevitably come along with them—felt untenable. The Onion headline <a href="https://www.theonion.com/amount-of-water-man-just-used-to-wash-dish-to-be-prize-1819578198">“Amount Of Water Man Just Used To Wash Dish To Be Prize Of Hand-To-Hand Combat Match In 2065”</a> ran through my head more as prophecy than satire. My husband and I listened to a <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/748/transcript">This American Life episode</a> about a father who ruined his family by forcing them into further and further extremes of climate activism. We talked about how his actions were crazy, but also in a way, he was <em>right</em>, wasn’t he? I didn’t want to do that, but I had to do something.</p>



<p>So I focused on the personal side of things. I looked for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/2/20976180/climate-change-best-charities-effective-philanthropy">most impactful places to donate</a>. I did a lot research into sustainable clothes and where to buy green household products. After being pescetarian for many years I decided to start eating chicken again but stop eating cheese because the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore">CO2-to-protein conversion</a> is better for poultry. This new awareness about better ways to live my everyday life offered some relief.</p>



<p>And then I just sort of realized…I can work on this. In addition to common lifestyle changes, I could use real skills of mine to do something. I didn’t have to just be a bystander, patronizing and supporting the businesses and organizations trying to make a change. I could put my energy into it and contribute directly myself—and wouldn’t that go a lot further in helping alleviate the guilt and concern, and make me feel like I can actually go on?</p>



<p>So I looked into what someone with my skillset could do. And I also looked into getting new skillsets. But switching topic area and skills at once is hard, so applying what I already knew a bit about—machine learning—to climate seemed the most reasonable way in. I joined a bunch of online communities (which I will collect in an upcoming blog post on working on climate), I took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact">online courses</a>, listened to podcasts, and found some chances to start doing climate data science.</p>



<p>Immersing yourself in an entirely new field—or fields really—as a 30-something year old is weird. You can feel like you don’t even know where to start. But it’s also totally fun. Especially with something like climate change work, which touches absolutely every aspect of everything about your life. I started to think about materials — what is everything around me made of and why? And how could it be done differently to make it all more doable for the longer term. I started to pay a lot of attention to shipping too—where were things coming from and how did they get here? On a jetski tour to the Statue of Liberty, I got distracted by the barges coming over the horizon. And weather! Clouds had so much more meaning after I learned about global wind and pressure patterns. Same for agriculture, energy, ecology, etc. The sense of empowerment that came from knowing more about how the world around me works was an unexpected benefit.</p>



<p>And it’s true that action is the antidote to depression. The community of people working towards climate mitigation and adaptation are so inspiring. They really make you think that change can happen and that you can—<em>in fact, you must</em>—be a part of it, in small ways and big. And the future of clean energy powered cities and sustainable agriculture and so on has so many other beneficial side effects that its crazy that we aren’t there already. A climate change resilient future is not one of deprivation and de-growth, at least not in the ways that matter.</p>



<p>So I knew I had to work on climate. But it’s odd, as someone 4 years out of a 6 year PhD, to try to work in a totally new field. I felt crazy knowing that there are people who are as expert in climate topics as I am in my niche neuro-modeling field, and yet I’m trying to contribute something at all to their work. And what about all my hard-earned neuroscience knowledge? Is it worth it—to me and to the field that trained me—to throw that away to become a novice in a new (though more important) area?</p>



<p>Then I learned about this position at NYU. I am currently a joint assistant professor of Psychology and Data Science. Granted, my computational work on the brain is the main reason for a Data Science title, I saw in that affiliation a chance to grow what had been a side hobby during my postdoc into a proper component of my research. So I am now advertising that, in addition to my work on neuroscience and psychology, my lab does computer vision for climate change. And while that is composed of just one project at the moment, I am excited to grow and work with more partners and students to help solve some of the ML problems people have while trying to save the world.</p>



<p>In some ideal setting, I could just keep working on the neuroscience and psychology and AI questions I find most interesting, without a care for the planet. But the world is far from ideal. There is a <a href="https://youtu.be/R8m_5HDZF7w?t=98">Good Place episode</a> wherein it is revealed just how negatively impactful the simple act of buying a tomato can be on the world. I may want to just do interesting things everyday but my attempts to do that are contributing to the destruction of the planet and humanity. Knowing this makes every bit of time I spend <em>not</em> working on climate a pure <em>indulgence</em>.</p>



<p>Having this attitude makes the normal “stressors” of academic life feel less stressful. Applying to grants, writing papers…getting my grants and papers rejected… It’s all fine! I’m on borrowed time here. The fact that I get to spend any time speculating about the brain and mind is a gift. And I’m paying it forward by putting some effort into making a more sustainable planet, so that us humans can keep speculating on the brain and mind for years to come.</p>



<p>It also turns out that I find the climate work pretty academically stimulating. I just bought a <a href="https://www.guilford.com/books/Introduction-to-Remote-Sensing/Campbell-Wynne-Thomas/9781462549405">textbook on remote sensing</a> and I am <em>itching</em> to dive in. For whatever reason, I love thinking about vision, be it human or computer. Maybe in a different random seed of the universe I’d have been doing this work from the start.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don’t know if any of this will work out. I don’t know if academia is built for this kind of split interest. I don’t even really know how I’ll run my lab yet, logistically, with such different projects going on. But as <a href="https://alexsteffen.substack.com/p/discontinuity-is-the-job">climate futurist and writer Alex Steffen</a> so beautifully informs us, discontinuity is the job. The way things were done in a pre-climate-change-aware era are no indication of how they will be done now. The change is coming, one way or another. And this is one small change I’m making.</p>



<p>I aimed to make my lab logo gently reflect these mixed priorities. I played around with the text-to-image generator <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/">Craiyon</a> and ended up with a prompt along the lines of “brain with a sun in it logo”. One of the outputs was this pretty nice blue and yellow brain that I covered in purple to make it more NYU-y. The more I look at, the more I appreciate how much it represents: the sun and the blue indicate the climate, its placement near the occipital lobe highlights the visual system, and the sun’s reach across the brain captures the concept of attention—another favorite topic of mine. If a simple AI-generated lab logo can make it all work together, then hopefully I can too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-death-immunity-gene-crohns-disease-health">Black Death immunity came at a cost to modern-day health</a></h4>

              
                <p>A genetic variant that appears to have boosted medieval Europeans’ ability to survive the Black Death centuries ago may contribute — albeit in a small way — to an inflammatory disease afflicting people today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers used DNA collected from centuries-old remains to discern the fingerprints that bubonic plague during the Black Death left on Europeans’ immune systems. This devastating wave of disease <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05349-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to spare those who possessed a variant of a gene</a> known as <em>ERAP2</em>, causing it to become more common, researchers report October 19 in <em>Nature</em>. That variant is already known to scientists for slightly increasing the odds of developing Crohn’s disease, in which errant inflammation harms the digestive system.</p>





<p>The results show “how these studies on ancient DNA can help actually understand diseases even now,” says Mihai Netea, an infectious diseases specialist at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, Netherlands, who was not involved with the study. “And the trade-off is also very clear.”</p>



<p>Caused <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-black-death-ancient-dna-bacteria-europe-origin-asia">by the bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em></a>, bubonic plague once killed 60 percent of those infected (<em>SN: 6/15/22</em>). In the ancient world, it caused successive waves of misery, the most devastating of which was the Black Death, often dated from 1346 to 1350, an episode thought to have wiped out at least 25 million people — about a third or more of the European population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By sparing individuals whose immune systems bear certain traits, pathogens such as <em>Y. pestis</em> have shaped the evolution of the human immune system. Studies are teasing out the ways the massive winnowing of the plague altered Europeans’ immune-related genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this most recent study, population geneticist Luis Barreiro of the University of Chicago and colleagues collected samples containing DNA from the remains of 516 people in London and Denmark who died between 1000 and 1800, including those buried during the Black Death. The researchers examined stretches of DNA for immune-related genes and areas associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p>Within those regions, the researchers identified four locations on chromosomes where they saw strong evidence of genetic changes that appeared to have been driven by the Black Death. In follow-up work, one change stood out: an increase in the frequency of a variant of <em>ERAP2</em>. When infected with <em>Y. pestis</em>, immune cells from people with this version of <em>ERAP2</em> more effectively killed the bacteria than cells lacking the variant.&nbsp;Studies of modern populations have linked that same variant to Crohn&#8217;s disease.</p>



<p>While the researchers calculate that the <em>ERAP2</em> variant improved the odds of surviving the Black Death by as much as 40 percent, it only slightly increases the risk for Crohn’s disease. For complex disorders like Crohn’s, “you require probably hundreds, sometimes thousands of genetic variants to actually increase your risk in a significant manner,” Barreiro says.</p>



<p>For some time now, researchers in the field have theorized that adaptations that helped our ancestors fortify their immune systems against infectious diseases can contribute to excessive, damaging immune activity. Earlier studies of plague offer support for this idea. A<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1317723111" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> genetic analysis seeking traces of historical disease in modern Europeans</a> and a study of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/10/4059/6277411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA from the remains of 16th century German plague victims</a> both turned up what appear to be protective changes against the plague that, like the <em>ERAP2</em> variant, are linked with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, this latest discovery suggests that genetic changes that have amped up the human immune response in the past, empowering it to better fight off ancient infections, can come at a cost. “If you turn the heat too much, that leads to disease,” Barreiro says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-siberian-neandertals-social-lives">Ancient DNA unveils Siberian Neandertals’ small-scale social lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>DNA from a group of Neandertals who lived together and a couple of others who lived not far away has yielded the best genetic peek to date into the social worlds of these ancient hominids.</p>



<p>As early as around 59,000 years ago, Neandertal communities in a mountainous part of Central Asia consisted of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05283-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small groups of close relatives and adult female newcomers</a>, researchers report October 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That social scenario comes courtesy of DNA extracted from the teeth and bones of 13 Neandertals found at two caves in the foothills of southern Siberia’s Altai Mountains. Estimates of overall genetic similarity among these Stone Age folks indicate that they formed communities of about 20 individuals, with females often migrating from their home groups to those of their mates, say evolutionary geneticist Laurits Skov of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues.</p>





<p>It’s unknown whether Altai Neandertals’ small-scale lifestyle was unusual, perhaps due to living in a sparsely populated area, or mirrored Neandertal practices elsewhere in Asia and Europe. Large numbers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-first-hominid-modify-environment-forest-grassland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neandertals in Central Europe transformed a forest into grassland</a> around 125,000 years, suggesting they could scale up communities when needed (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>



<p>Skov’s group studied the DNA of 11 Neandertals from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/siberia-cave-contains-clues-about-two-epic-neandertal-treks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chagyrskaya Cave</a> and two Neandertals from Okladnikov Cave (<em>SN: 1/27/20</em>). The Chagyrskaya individuals included a father and his teenage daughter as well as an adult female and an 8- to 12-year-old boy, who was possibly her nephew or grandson.</p>



<p>In the Chagyrskaya group, mitochondrial DNA, typically inherited from the mother, displayed greater diversity than DNA from the Y chromosome, which is inherited only by males. The enhanced mitochondrial DNA variety suggests that adult females frequently moved into that community while the males stayed put, the researchers suspect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/10/oa-weeks-past/">OA Weeks past, but not forgotten</a></h4>

              
                <p>Open Access (OA) Week is a time that&rsquo;s dear to our hearts at PLOS. PLOS is a proud co-founder of OA Week. Back in 2008, PLOS alumna Donna Okubo, helped to organize an <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2008/08/participate-in-open-access-day-and-help-celebrate-our-5th-birthday/">OA Day</a>, together with representatives from <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc">SPARC</a> and <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>. Based on the success of that event, the group decided to expand OA Day to a full week the following year. OA Week is also an unofficial birthday of sorts, coinciding as it does with the first issues of our first journals: <em>PLOS Biology</em> in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/issue?id=10.1371/issue.pbio.v01.i01">October 2003</a>, and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/issue?id=10.1371/issue.pmed.v01.i01">October 2004</a> (plus <em>PLOS NTDs</em> in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/issue?id=10.1371/issue.pntd.v01.i01">October 2007</a>, and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/10/plos-global-public-health-publishes-first-papers/">October 2021</a>).</p>



<p>The Open movement has grown and changed a lot over the past 14 years. Through it all PLOS has remained at the forefront of Open, exemplifying the themes of each celebration&mdash;almost like they were tailor-made, just for us. Let&rsquo;s take a look back at highlights from those past celebrations, and a look ahead at where we think the Open movement is headed next.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2009</strong></h4>



<p><em>The first OA Week!</em></p>



<p>Following on the success of OA Day in 2008, in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2009/10/open-access-week/">2009</a> <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/">Open Access Directory</a>, <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>, <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc">SPARC</a>, <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>, <a href="http://www.eifl.net/cps/sections/home">eIFL (Electronic Information for Libraries)</a> and <a href="http://www.openoasis.org/">OASIS</a> came together to organize the first ever OA Week! At the time, PLOS was just eight years old. <em>PLOS ONE had </em>just been honored with the ALPSP Publishing Innovation Award.<em> PLOS Medicine</em> had just published the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097">PRISMA guidelines</a> for reporting systematic reviews. Everyone still thought we were crazy.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2012</strong></h4>



<p><em>The first OA Week with a theme&mdash;Open by Default</em></p>



<p>Skipping ahead a few years to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2012/10/oa-week/">2012</a>, Open Access was moving into the mainstream. <em>PLOS ONE</em> had published over 40,000 articles. Universities like Harvard, UCSF, the University of Oslo, and others implemented new Open Access recommendations and policies. The scientific publishing establishment of North America and Europe had begun to realize Open was here to stay, and new journals began to proliferate. Nature&rsquo;s <em>Scientific Reports </em>turned a year old. PLOS alumni founded new OA journals <em>eLife </em>and <em>PeerJ</em>. At PLOS, though our Open Data policy was still almost two years away, our advocacy team was already out there advocating for the next phase of the Open movement: free and open data.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2014</strong></h4>



<p><em>Theme&mdash;Generation Open</em></p>



<p>The 2014 theme, Generation Open, celebrated the rising enthusiasm for Open Access, and began to look ahead at what comes after simple &ldquo;access.&rdquo; For PLOS, the answer at that point was data. The <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">PLOS Open Data Policy</a> officially went into effect in March of 2014 requiring that all data underlying the conclusions in a research article be made publicly available upon publication, either as a Supporting Information (SI) file or in a data repository. The measure was designed to support reproducibility, demonstrate credibility, and enable future meta-analysis. This new policy signaled the beginning of PLOS&rsquo; shift in focus to Open Science.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2015</strong></h4>



<p><em>Theme&mdash;Open for Collaboration</em></p>



<p>Research is becoming increasingly cross-disciplinary and complex, and as a result, researchers are collaborating more&mdash;not in a traditional hierarchical lab structure, but as part of a team, with equal partners tackling different aspects of the work. In 2015, PLOS took two big steps to represent authorship in a way that more accurately reflects the realities of scholarly contributions: <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2015/10/collaboration-improves-recognition-credit/">ORCID</a>, a unique identifier which differentiate researchers from one another, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2015/10/collaboration-improves-recognition-credit/">CRediT taxonomy</a>, which describes each authors&rsquo; contributions to the study in detail.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2017</strong></h4>



<p><em>Theme&mdash;Open in Order To&hellip;</em></p>



<p>OA Week 2017 was all about how Openness supports and advances the <strong>goals and values of research</strong>&mdash;not just openness for the sake of openness. PLOS was ready to help facilitate, with options like direct transfers from bioRxiv to PLOS journal submission systems, hyperlinks from article methods sections to publicly post protocols on protocols.io, the chance to publish sooner with uncorrected page proofs, and more.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2019</strong></h4>



<p><em>Theme&mdash;Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge</em></p>



<p>2019 was the year of the reviewer at PLOS. We implemented optional, opt-in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">Published Peer Review History</a>. In this model, reviews decide whether to sign reviews, while authors decide whether to publish their decision letters (including peer reviews) and author responses, resulting in four possible degrees of openness in peer review. We also enabled <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/">ORCID for peer reviewers</a>, enabling reviewers to claim credit for review work with ease, and without disclosing their identities.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2020 and 2021</strong></h4>



<p><em>Themes&mdash;Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion </em>and <em>It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity</em></p>



<p>Over the next few years, OA Week continued to focus its attention on equity in science and science communication. In 2020 PLOS made progress on both fronts, with the introduction of a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/">transgender author name change policy</a>, and our public commitment to impliment <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">DEI standards</a> in the running of our journals. <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, our new journal <a href="https://vimeo.com/600587106">founded on the principles of global inclusion</a>, was warmly received. We also introduced a new non-APC publishing model option named and designed for <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks before OA Week 2021, PLOS won the <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/news/winners-announced-alpsp-awards-september-2021/275591">ALPSP Award for Innovation in Publishing</a>, for our Community Action Publishing Model&mdash;a funding model designed to eliminate author fees for Open Access journals and create a more equitable Open Access publication system. Also in 2021, PLOS introduced our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">Inclusion in Global Research Policy</a>, developed in collaboration with researchers, and aimed at preventing practices known as &ldquo;parachute&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial&rdquo; research, in which scientists travel to conduct research in under-resourced communities, relying on local experts without acknowledging their contributions.</p>



<h4><strong>OA Week 2022 (We&rsquo;re still at it!)</strong></h4>



<p><em>Theme&mdash;Open for Climate Justice</em></p>



<p>OA Week 2022 examines the climate crisis&mdash;an area that has been a particular concentration for PLOS over the past several years. In 2021 we announced that PLOS would be adding to its portfolio for the first time in over 10 years, with a special emphasis on environmental research. Earlier this year, three of our brand new journals&mdash;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/"><em>PLOS Water</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a>&mdash;proudly published their first articles. Each new publication is, of course, fully Open Access, fully machine readable, and supported by Open Data, with CRediT and ORCID integration. In addition, each author had access to Open Science tools like preprints, Published Peer Review History, and more.</p>



<h2>Where is Open Science headed next?</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;d like more data. In particular, we&rsquo;d like quantitative insight into the levels and trends in adoption of Open Science practices, the differences across fields and regions, the impact of the solutions we&rsquo;ve created together with our communities, and the barriers to adoption. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re implementing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a>, in partnership with DataSeer.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about his recent work
on &quot;Novel Computational Methods for Predicting Transitions in Spatiotemporal
Neurodynamics between Attention and Mind-wandering&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Abstract of related work:</p>
<p>We introduce new techniques to the analysis of neural spatiotemporal
dynamics via applying -machine reconstruction to
electroencephalography (EEG) microstate sequences. Microstates are
short duration quasi-stable states of the dynamically changing
electrical field topographies recorded via an array of electrodes from
the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The sequence
of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. -machines are
discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities
on different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG
microstate). They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an
optimally predictive manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics
emulating the behaviour of the source. Here we present experiments
using both simulations and empirical data supporting the value of
associating these discrete dynamical systems with mental states (e.g.
mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical
populations can then be further characterized by properties of these
dynamical systems, including: i) statistical complexity (determined by
the number of states of the corresponding -automaton); ii) entropy
rate; iii) characteristic sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic
grammars); iv) duration, persistence and stability of dynamical
patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as Krohn-Rhodes complexity or
holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The potential
applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being
interventions, human-machine interface, and others on both subject-
specific and group/population-level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-stars-space-starlight-stardust-astronomy">For the first time, astronomers saw dust in space being pushed by starlight</a></h4>

              
                <p>A pair of stars in our galaxy is revealing how light pushes around matter. It’s the first time anyone has directly seen how the pressure of light from stars changes the flow of dust in space.</p>



<p>Such radiation pressure influences how dust clears from the regions near young stars and guides the formation of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stellar-winds-how-planetary-nebulae-stunning-shapes">gas clouds around dying stars</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). The dust pattern surrounding a stellar pair 5,600 light-years away in the Cygnus constellation is providing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05155-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rare laboratory to observe the effect in action</a>, astronomer Yinuo Han and colleagues report in the Oct. 13 <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Astronomers have long known that the dust emerging from the star WR 140 and its companion is formed by gas from these two stars colliding and condensing into soot. But images of the pair taken over the course of 16 years show that the dust is accelerating as it travels away from the stars.</p>



<p>Dust initially departs the stars at about 6.5 million kilometers per hour, the researchers report, and over the course of a year accelerates to nearly 10 million km/h. At that speed, the dust could make the trip from our sun to Earth in a mere 15 hours.</p>



<p>The revelation came from comparing the positions of concentric dust shells year to year and deducing a speed.&nbsp;The researchers’ calculations show that the force accelerating the dust is the pressure exerted by light radiated from the stars, says Han, of the University of Cambridge. “Radiation pressure [becomes apparent] only when we put all the images next to each other.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only are those layers of dust feeling light’s push, they also extend out farther than any telescope could see — until this year. Images from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, depict <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01812-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of the dusty layers around WR 140 and its companion</a> than ever seen before, Han and another team report October 12 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>At first glance, the intricate patterns surrounding the stars resemble a gigantic spider web. But the researchers’ analysis reveals that they are actually enormous, expanding, cone-shaped dust shells. They’re nested inside each other, with a new one forming every eight years as the stars complete another journey around their orbits. In the new images, the shells look like sections of rings because we observe them from the side, Han says.  </p>

Han/Univ. of Cambridge</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The patterns don’t completely surround the stars because the distance between the stars changes as they orbit one another. When the stars are far apart, the density of the colliding gas is too low to condense to dust — an effect the researchers expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What surprised them is that the gas doesn’t condense well when the stars are closest together either. That suggests there’s a “Goldilocks zone” for dust formation: Dust forms only when the separation between the stars is just right, creating a series of concentric dust shells rippling away from the duo.</p>



<p>“Their Goldilocks zone is a new idea,” says astrophysicist Andy Pollock of the University of Sheffield in England, who was not part of either study. “A similar sort of thing happens in my field of X-rays.”</p>



<p>In his work, Pollock has observed that WR 140 and its partner emit more X-rays as the stars approach each other, but then fewer as they get very close together, suggesting there’s a Goldilocks zone for X-rays coming from the stars as well. “It would be interesting to see if there&#8217;s any connection” between the two types of Goldilocks zones, he says. “All of this must somehow fit together.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-young-adult-crisis-derailment">The pandemic shows us how crises derail young adults’ lives for decades</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ninna Ragasa was 24 years old when doctors discovered a mass on the left hemisphere of her brain. Further imaging revealed that Ragasa had an arteriovenous malformation, a tangle of blood vessels that disrupt the flow of oxygen to the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doctors suggested removing the mass to avoid the possibility of it rupturing, a potentially fatal outcome. Ragasa, a graduate student in interior design at the Pratt Institute in New York City, worried that the brain surgery would hurt her mobility and her career aspirations.</p>





<p>“Being a designer came easily to me,” says Ragasa, who is a friend of mine.</p>



<p>But the procedure went smoothly, and Ragasa returned to her life at Pratt. Then a year or so after the surgery, Ragasa started falling. At first, she blamed her hard-work, hard-party lifestyle and cut back on drinks. But she kept falling. So she switched from spike heels to chunky boots and then to flip flops. Nothing helped. One day Ragasa fell getting off the subway and had to crawl to her mother’s house.</p>



<p>Scans revealed that Ragasa’s brain had swelled after the procedure, causing her to gradually lose mobility along the right side of her body. Ragasa could no longer handle the physical demands of being an art student, such as building models and drawing. So she dropped out of school and found a job that came with medical insurance to pay for her physical therapy treatments. She felt, she says, totally lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of us get derailed at some point in our lives. We may get sick like Ragasa, divorced, laid off or lose a loved one. Our age when calamity strikes can profoundly influence our response to the event, research suggests, with young adults particularly vulnerable to getting thrown off course. That’s partially because when the rites of passage that mark the transition from childhood to adulthood are delayed or lost, young adults can feel unmoored and increasingly uncertain about the future — a point driven home by this cohort’s plummeting well-being during the ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Researchers have not always treated young adulthood as markedly different from other adult years. But it’s now well established that the<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cognitive-neuroscientist-warns-us-justice-system-harms-teen-brains"> human brain</a> matures well into one’s 20s (<em>SN</em>: 5/22/19). And social and economic changes in recent generations mean that the once linear path from living in one’s parents’ home to moving out and starting one’s own family has elongated and become considerably more jagged. And for years, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">climate change</a> has added mounting uncertainty to the already fraught mix (<em>SN: </em>8/18/21). The pandemic, in other words, did not cause the mental health crisis among young adults, but merely accelerated existing trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ages 18 to 25 constitute an intense time of exploration in love, work and worldview. This age band should be treated as <a href="http://www.jeffreyarnett.com/ARNETT_Emerging_Adulthood_theory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a unique developmental period</a>, distinct from either being a child or a full-fledged adult, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett of Clark University in Worcester, Ma., wrote in a seminal 2000 paper in <em>American Psychologist.</em> “Emerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life&#8217;s possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pandemic has forced us to ask: What happens when that “scope of independent exploration of life’s possibilities” gets stalled or even curtailed?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The evidence so far suggests that the fallout for young adults could be dire. Instead of maturing, this group’s personalities have become <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-young-adults-personality-development">more juvenile</a>, I reported last month (<em>SN: </em>9/28/22). In general, those under age 30 have become less conscientious, less agreeable and more neurotic. Compared with older adults, young adults have also reported <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211042109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher levels</a> of anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness during the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A survey of roughly 2,600 U.S. adults taken in January 2022, showed that members of this group have distorted the U-curve. This somewhat controversial theory holds that well-being, including happiness and health, are high in early and later life but low in middle age. In this view, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2795626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despair</a>, once reserved for middle age, has, it seems, become the badge of youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/human-flourishing/202208/why-young-peoples-mental-well-being-is-in-such-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left part of the ‘U’</a> has essentially completely flattened,” wrote study coauthor and Harvard University epidemiologist Tyler VanderWeele in <em>Psychology Today. </em>“Young people … report being less happy and less healthy; having less meaning, greater struggles with character, and poor relationships; and [being] less financially stable compared to their older counterparts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decisions made during young adulthood can also have profound knock-on effects. Temporarily delaying going to college at the pandemic’s onset, for instance, could become a permanent decision, thereby radically shifting the trajectory of one’s life.</p>



<p>Some young adults will recover from this event without much trouble, but others may struggle, says personality psychologist Rodica Damian of the University of Houston. “Sometimes when something happens during a critical development period, there is a snowball effect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Damian’s comment reminded me of a conversation I had more than a year ago with developmental psychologist Anthony Burrow of Cornell University. Rather presciently, shortly before the pandemic hit, Burrow had begun characterizing a phenomenon he referred to as “derailment.” Derailment, Burrow told me, refers to people’s feeling that their life has been thrown off course. That feeling can lead people to lose their sense of identity, to struggle to answer the question: <em>Who am I?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>“Derailment is a subjective sense that who you were cannot be reconciled with who you are,” Burrow says. “That train was heading in one direction on those tracks, but can no longer advance on that track.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to gauge derailment during the pandemic is to ask ourselves: “Am I still the same person as I was pre-pandemic?” Burrow says. “It’s a basic question with profound implications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>People in the United States who feel derailed struggle with anxiety, depression and reduced feelings of well-being, Burrow and his team reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.</em> Moreover, those <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30080063/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feelings of derailment</a> are associated with depressive symptoms a year or more down the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Burrow’s work also points to ways to get our metaphorical trains back on track. In that same study, he found that journaling — having people write a narrative that stitches together their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">past and present selves</a> — can help them regain that sense of continuity and reestablish goals for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other research suggests that adopting a more flexible <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938291/pdf/10902_2021_Article_375.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Asian mindset</a> could help people cope with a life that veers off course. Derailed Japanese individuals, that is, do not show the same drop in well-being observed as Westerners, researchers reported in 2021 in the <em>Journal of Happiness Studies. </em>The researchers suspect that the difference lies in thinking styles. While Westerners tend to believe life should follow a linear course, Japanese people tend to believe life is dialectic, or full of contradictions and in constant flux. Derailments, as such, are to be expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ragasa, who moved to the United States from the Philippines as a child, understands that flux. But losing her identity in her 20s, at a time when she felt physically and emotionally invincible, left her reeling. She eventually moved to Vermont and had a son.</p>



<p>Still, she took years to accept that the old art track she was on was gone forever. “I had to mourn it and let it go,” she says. Now, she says, she has begun the arduous process of finding a new track. “I still feel lost,” she says. “I have to figure out who I am now.”</p>

<p>The abstract for the talk is&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>Graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely available and have been used with
great success to accelerate scientific computing in the last decade. These
advances, however, are often not available to researchers interested in
simulating spiking neural networks, but lacking the technical knowledge to
write the necessary low-level code. Writing low-level code is not necessary
when using the popular Brian simulator, which provides a framework to generate
efficient <span class="caps">CPU</span> code from high-level model definitions in Python. Here, we
present Brian2CUDA, an open-source software that extends the Brian simulator
with a <span class="caps">GPU</span> backend. Our implementation generates efficient code for the
numerical integration of neuronal states and for the propagation of synaptic
events on GPUs, making use of their massively parallel arithmetic capabilities.
We benchmark the performance improvements of our software for several model
types and find that it can accelerate simulations by up to three orders of
magnitude compared to Brian&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span> backend. Currently, Brian2CUDA is the only
package that supports Brian&#8217;s full feature set on GPUs, including arbitrary
neuron and synapse models, plasticity rules, and heterogeneous delays. When
comparing its performance with Brian2GeNN, another <span class="caps">GPU</span>-based backend for the
Brian simulator with fewer features, we find that Brian2CUDA gives comparable
speedups, while being typically slower for small and faster for large networks.
By combining the flexibility of the Brian simulator with the simulation speed
of GPUs, Brian2CUDA enables researchers to efficiently simulate spiking neural
networks with minimal effort and thereby makes the advancements of <span class="caps">GPU</span>
computing available to a larger audience of&nbsp;neuroscientists.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybee-mental-number-line-order-left-right">Honeybees order numbers from left to right, a study claims</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like many humans, honeybees seem to prefer their numbers ordered from left to right.</p>



<p>Honeybees trained to recognize a specific number tend to fly left when given two side-by-side options of a smaller number and right when the options represent a larger number, a new study claims. The finding suggests that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2203584119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honeybees have a “mental number line”</a> and that this association has biological roots, researchers report October 17 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>While some scientists agree that the study makes a compelling case for a mental number line in honeybees, others argue that the new work is an oversimplification of complex human behavior.</p>



<p>Many humans have a mental number line that often puts smaller numbers on the left and bigger numbers on the right — if asked to organize several bunches of grapes by size, you’d likely line them up by increasing number of grapes from left to right. Whether this association is present at birth or learned later in life has long been a subject of debate.</p>



<p>Previous work has shown that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honeybees can count</a>, and that they even understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bees-join-exclusive-crew-animals-get-concept-zero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the concept of zero</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/18</em>). “When you realize all these facts, an obvious question [is whether honeybees have] the so-called mental number line,” says Martin Giurfa, a biologist at the Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France. Working from home during COVID-19 lockdowns, Giurfa tested 134 honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) on their number-ordering abilities using a design developed with researchers who had done <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicks-show-left-right-number-bias" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar experiments with chicks</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human babies</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/15</em>).</p>



<p>First, Giurfa had to teach his bee pupils to recognize numbers. Using sugar water, he lured honeybees into a testing chamber built from a repurposed wine box. For each bee, he hung a panel on the back of the box with a certain number of symbols on it — one, three or five — and fed them the sugar water so they’d learn to associate the number with food. By varying what the symbols looked like between visits, he ensured the bees were learning the number itself and not certain shapes or arrangements.</p>



<p>After 30 trips to the box, it was time for a test: Giurfa removed the training panel and set up two, mirror-image panels, one on the left wall of the box and one on the right. These new panels either had the same number of symbols as the training panel, fewer symbols or more.</p>



<p>Which panel did the bees fly to — left or right? “It depends on your reference number,” Giurfa says. Of the bees trained on “one,” 72 percent flew to the “three” panel to the right, but of the bees trained on “five,” 73 percent went to the “three” panel to the left. “That’s exactly the concept of the mental number line,” Giurfa says. “You align numbers based on your reference.” If the test number was the same as the training number, the bees showed no preference for left or right.</p>



<p>These experiments “make a very compelling case” for a mental number line in honeybees, says Felicity Muth, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved with the study. “They have a number of controls that really rule out any of the alternative explanations I can think of.”</p>



<p>Giurfa believes these results show that mental number lines, or at least some component of them, are present across the animal kingdom. However, not everyone is convinced.</p>



<p>&#8220;The oversimplification of complex human concepts, such as that of ‘number line,’ must be avoided, since they severely distort the reality of the phenomena that make them possible,” says Rafael Núñez, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Núñez, who coauthored <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article critical of the earlier chick study</a>, thinks animal research should address why bees and chicks would have inborn mental number lines while some human groups, like <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those he’s studied in Papua New Guinea</a>, don’t. Giurfa acknowledges that culture plays a role in explaining why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-number-line-space-map-different-directions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not every adult naturally orders numbers from left to right</a>, but feels that the proof is there for a biological underpinning (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>This study stops short of explaining why the brains of bees, chicks and babies have all converged on the same left-to-right number ordering but does offer a possible answer — their asymmetrical brains. All three have brains that process information differently on the left and right sides. “It might be an inherent property to these lateralized brain systems,” Giurfa says.</p>



<p>A shared system for organizing numbers, if truly widespread, would highlight how surprisingly similar animal minds can be to our own. Though some cognitive powers seem to be uniquely human, Giurfa thinks there is danger in dismissing the abilities of animals. “We are different from animals in some aspects,” he says, “but we are very similar in others. Denying this similarity is not what will help us understand what we are.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seabirds-typhoons-shearwaters-survival">Some seabirds survive typhoons by flying into them</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some seabirds don’t just survive storms. They ride them.</p>



<p>Streaked shearwaters nesting on islands off Japan <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212925119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes head straight toward passing typhoons</a>, where they fly near the eye of the storm for hours at a time, researchers report in the Oct. 11 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. This strange behavior — not reported in any other bird species — might help streaked shearwaters (<em>Calonectris leucomelas</em>) survive strong storms.</p>



<p>Birds and other animals living in areas with hurricanes and typhoons have adopted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/what-happens-animals-hurricane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies to weather these deadly storms</a> (<em>SN: 10/2/15</em>). &nbsp;In recent years, a few studies using GPS trackers have revealed that some ocean-dwelling birds — such as the frigatebird (<em>Fregata minor</em>) — will take <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41481-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive detours to avoid cyclones</a>.</p>





<p>This is an understandable strategy for birds that spend most of their time at sea where “there is literally nowhere to hide,” says Emily Shepard, a behavior ecologist at Swansea University in Wales. To find out whether shearwaters also avoid storms, she and her colleagues used 11 years of tracking data from GPS locators attached to the wings of 75 birds nesting on Awashima Island in Japan.</p>



<p>By combining this information with data on wind speeds during typhoons, the researchers discovered that shearwaters that were caught out in the open ocean when a storm blew in would ride tailwinds around the edges of the storm. However, others that found themselves sandwiched between land and the eye of a strong cyclone would sometimes veer off their usual flight patterns and head toward the center of the storm.</p>

<h3>Flight path</h3>



<p>As Typhoon Cimaron moved across the Sea of Japan (black track) in August 2018, GPS trackers monitored the movements of 32 streaked shearwaters (<em>Calonectris leucomelas</em>) just off the coast of Japan. The tracking data show three birds (seen here in red and teal) flew toward the eye of the storm through some of the highest winds. Two other birds (light green) began heading toward the eye as the storm swept past.</p>

Lempidakis <em>et al/PNAS</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure></div></div>



<p>Of the 75 monitored shearwaters, 13 flew to within 60 kilometers of the eye — an area Shepherd calls the “eye socket,” where the winds were strongest — for up to eight hours, tracking the cyclone as it headed northward. “It was one of those moments where we couldn’t believe what we were seeing,” Shepard says. “We had a few predictions for how they might behave, but this was not one of them.”</p>



<p>The shearwaters were more likely to head for the eye during stronger storms, soaring on winds as swift as 75 kilometers per hour. This suggest that the birds might be following the eye to avoid being blown inland, where they risk crashing onto land or being hit by flying debris, Shepard says.</p>



<p>While this is the first time this behavior has been spotted in any bird species, flying with the winds could be a common tactic for preserving energy during cyclones, says Andrew Farnsworth, an ornithologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study. “It might seem counterintuitive,” he says. “But from the perspective of bird behavior, it makes a lot of sense.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-variants-fall-surge">A swarm of sneaky omicron variants could cause a COVID-19 surge this fall</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fall and winter have not been kind to us over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>In 2020, cases of COVID-19 began to climb in October. And at this time last year, we were in the calm before the storm, so to speak, with delta-driven case counts slowly dipping before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">the omicron variant began its road to global domination</a> at the end of November (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>). What will happen in our third pandemic winter, as omicron continues to evolve and many people ditch their masks?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Only time will tell. But already there are some warning signs that we could be faced with yet another wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. For one, cases and hospitalizations are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/10/07/1127017062/early-signs-a-new-u-s-covid-surge-could-be-on-its-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing in some European countries</a>, including the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>What happens across the pond usually portends what will happen in the United States. At the national level and in most states, cases are still going down. But experts worry that may not hold true for long, as temperatures drop and more people gather indoors where the coronavirus is more likely to spread. Some Northeastern states, for instance, have seen a sharp increase in coronavirus levels in wastewater, suggesting there has been an uptick in transmission even if it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">not yet reflected in official case counts</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>There’s also a wild card this year, complicating matters. New versions of omicron abound. How might they shift the pandemic’s near future?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a hard question to answer. On one hand, we’re in a very different place than we were two years ago, or even last year, with more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-drugs-treatments-latest-news">treatments on hand</a> and an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">omicron-specific booster</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/22; SN: 9/2/22).</em> But the coronavirus has been known to throw us a few curveballs. Experts expect that winter will usher in yet another wave, but what it will look like and how high it will crest is unclear.</p>



<p>“Although we can feel good that we are going in the right direction, we can’t let our guard down,” said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci at an <a href="https://centerforhealthjournalism.org/content/covid-monkeypox-conversation-dr-anthony-fauci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 4 webinar</a> held by the University of Southern California Annenberg Center for Health Journalism in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>There is some good(ish) news: Most people have been exposed to the virus, whether through vaccination or — the less-desirable route — an infection, or both. That means our immune systems have the virus’s mug shot on hand. Our antibodies and T cells are trained to kick into high gear if the coronavirus trips any alarm bells as it enters our noses, throats or lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>These immune barriers can dampen the virus’s ability to spread among people, as well as protect many from becoming seriously ill. As a result, fewer people may end up in the hospital or dying compared with previous years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then there’s the bad news: Over the last year, the omicron variant has adopted a few disguises in the form of mutations that help the virus hide from our immune systems. Over the summer, a version called BA.5 rose to dominance, pushing out its relatives BA.2 and BA.2.12.1. Now, researchers are keeping tabs on a new alphanumeric motley crew of omicron versions.</p>



<p>It is possible that a new worrisome variant could suddenly appear and outcompete all its relatives, as the delta and omicron variants did in 2021. The next name on the list would be “pi.”</p>



<p>But another — perhaps more likely — possibility is that over the next few months, our attention won’t be focused on a single lineage that sweeps the world but on a swarm of new variants. That’s thanks in part to the arms race between our immune systems and the virus.</p>



<p>Now that so many people have some kind of protection, compared with in 2020 or early 2021, the coronavirus must constantly change in ways that poke holes in those defenses in order to spread. Some variants circulating now have independently <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired the same mutations,</a> imparting similar abilities to dodge antibodies in lab tests, researchers report in a preliminary study posted October 4 at bioRxiv.org. With multiple variants using the same tactics to get around people’s immune systems, it can be tough for a single variant to come out on top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the newest omicron versions, BQ.1.1 and BA.2.75.2, are <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly adept at dodging some individual antibodies</a> taken from people who had recovered from a BA.2 or BA.5 infection, the researchers found. That means some people may be more susceptible to another infection if the new versions, which are <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so far present at low levels in the United States</a>, spread widely this fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officials have already taken some steps to tackle this ever-changing virus. This fall, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna released tweaked versions of their mRNA vaccines that tackle both the original version of the coronavirus and omicron to give immune systems a refresher course. But few of these updated shots are making it into arms. Half of U.S. adults say they have heard <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little to nothing</a> about COVID-19 boosters, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released September 30. And so far, only around <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percent of people</a> age 12 or older have gotten the new jabs. (On October 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed off on</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1012-COVID-19-Vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bivalent boosters</a> for 5- to 11-year-olds.)</p>



<p>What’s more, omicron’s continued evolution means that vulnerable people are fast losing COVID-19 treatment options. The October 4 study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that the last stronghold of antibody drugs that are used to treat or protect high-risk patients — therapies called bebtelovimab and Evusheld — didn’t recognize some of the new variants when tested in lab dishes. And on October 3, the FDA warned that Evusheld, which is used as a preexposure treatment to protect immunocompromised people, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-releases-important-information-about-risk-covid-19-due-certain-variants-not-neutralized-evusheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t work for all variants</a>. The drug still offers protection against many of the currently circulating variants, the FDA said, as does the antiviral Paxlovid. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unknown that we’re facing this winter is how much other respiratory infections might add on to an already COVID-heavy burden. Flu season in Australia, usually a bellwether for those of us north of the equator, was back after a two-year hiatus and got an earlier than usual start. Experts are once again <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">warning about a possible “twindemic”</a> in the Northern Hemisphere, with both influenza and the coronavirus making people ill (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). Not to mention, there are myriad other infections that most people haven’t been exposed to over the last couple of years thanks to masking and social distancing.</p>



<p>That’s not to say everyone needs to prepare for yet another lonely winter. But it’s a sobering reminder that taking extra precautions such as testing before social gatherings and masking — especially around vulnerable people — would be wise, even as we get on with our lives. And that reminds me: I need to order more masks.</p>

<p>Robots with social behaviors have been proposed as a potential solution to ease people&rsquo;s loneliness and the challenges of aging. Given the difficulty of creating robots that behave like humans, and the known benefits of the bond between owners and their dogs, some researchers are exploring the possibility of developing dog-inspired robots that can form similar bonds with humans. However, this endeavor requires a deeper understanding of specific dog behaviors that facilitate human-dog bonds.</p>



<h3><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></h3>



<p>To gain deeper insight into human&mdash;dog bonds, Riddoch and colleagues conducted a survey study of 153 dog owners. They asked the participants open-ended questions about which dog behaviors they felt were especially important in establishing and maintaining their bond with their dog.</p>



<p>Owners described a wide range of key behaviors, such as nudging the owner with a paw or looking back at the owner on walks, which appeared to facilitate such perceptions as the dog being protective or checking in with the owner. In analyzing the responses, the researchers identified 7 core categories of behaviors that owners felt were important: attunement, communication, consistency and predictability, physical affection, positivity and enthusiasm, proximity, and shared activities.</p>

<h3><strong>Future Research</strong></h3>



<p>Meanwhile, other research could further investigate the dog&mdash;human bond, such as by exploring variations in preferences for dog behaviors among people with different backgrounds and demographics.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The authors add: &ldquo;Using a qualitative approach enabled us to gain a deep and nuanced understanding of the things people find so endearing about our canine companions. While it won&rsquo;t be easy to model most of these behaviors on robots, this work offers new and exciting insights for those working to develop pet-like technologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Oil on the waters </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/oil-waters-modest-progress-cleanup-technology"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 14, 1972</p>



<p>[In the late 1960s], about the best means of cleaning up oil was to put straw on it, then scoop up the oily straw by hand or with pitchforks. Now industry … has devised an arsenal of oil cleanup chemicals. Thin-layer chemicals can be used to herd oil together and to thicken it…. Chemicals are available as absorbents too. Still other chemicals … disperse oil throughout the water. Other chemicals show promise as oil-burning agents.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Chemicals are the norm today, but the future of oil-cleanup technology may well be microbial. In recent years, researchers have shown that soil microbes broke down some of the oil from the 2010 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-munching-microbes-cleaning-gulf-marshes-faster-expected">Deepwater Horizon spill</a> in the Gulf of Mexico (<em>SN Online: 6/26/15</em>). And electrical bacteria, which channel electricity through their threadlike bodies, could help by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrical-bacteria-may-help-clean-oil-spills-and-curb-methane-emissions">turning oil munchers’ waste into fuel for the microbes</a>, scientists reported (<em>SN: 7/16/22&nbsp;&amp; 7/30/22, p.&nbsp;24</em>). Microbial mops aren’t yet ready for prime time, so chemical dispersants, fire and spongelike sorbents remain key tools in cleanup kits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-eye-nebula-3d-model-rings-jets">A 3-D model of the Cat’s Eye nebula shows rings sculpted by jets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly 3,000 light-years from Earth sits one of the most complex and least understood nebulae, a whirling landscape of gas and dust left in the wake of a star’s death throes. A new computer visualization reveals the 3-D structure of the Cat’s Eye nebula and hints at how not one, but a pair of dying stars sculpted its complexity.</p>



<p>The digital reconstruction, based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope, reveals two symmetric rings around the nebula’s edges. The rings were probably formed by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/516/2/2711/6696946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spinning jet of charged gas that was launched from two stars</a> in the nebula’s center, Ryan Clairmont and colleagues report in the October <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em><em>.</em></p>





<p>“I realized there hasn’t been a comprehensive study of the structure of the nebula since the early ’90s,” says Clairmont, an undergraduate at Stanford University. Last year, while a high school student in San Diego, he reached out to a couple of astrophysicists at a scientific imaging company called Ilumbra who had written software to reconstruct the 3-D structure of astronomical objects.</p>



<p>The team combined Hubble images with ground-based observations of light in several wavelengths, which revealed the motions of the nebula’s gas. Figuring out which parts were moving toward and away from Earth helped reveal its 3-D structure.</p>



<p>The team identified two partial rings to either side of the nebula’s center. The rings’ symmetry and unfinished nature suggest they are the remains of a plasma jet launched from the heart of the nebula, then snuffed out before it could complete a full circle. Such jets are usually formed through an interaction between two stars orbiting one another, says Ilumbra partner Wolfgang Steffen, who is based in Kaiserslautern, Germany.</p>



<p>The work <a href="https://projectboard.world/isef/finalist-booth/phys038---evolution-of-the-cats-eye-nebula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Clairmont a prize at the 2021 International Science and Engineering Fair</a>, an annual competition run by the Society for Science, which publishes <em>Science News</em>. Steffen was skeptical about the tight deadline — when Clairmont reached out, he had just two months to complete the project.</p>



<p>“I said that’s impossible! Not even Ph.D. students or anybody has tried that before,” Steffen says. “He did it brilliantly. He pulled it all off and more than we expected.”</p>

<h2><strong>Retraction specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is a retraction still seen in the academic community as a potentially career-ending/negative event for an author? Is this view changing?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is indeed still an issue, possibly in some countries more than others. We hope that the general view will change, and that those in positions to decide on sanctions, promotions, tenure decisions, and funding will consider case details rather than take a blanket view on retractions. Not all retractions are the same. There are cases of blatant and purposeful academic misconduct, which should have a negative effect on the perpetrator&rsquo;s career, but even in these cases there may be co-authors who were uninvolved in and unaware of the misconduct. There are also cases that stem from misunderstandings about authorship or data ownership, reporting errors and data unavailability, or honest errors. In some of these cases, a retraction may be an indicator of a training gap. Punishing retractions uniformly, without considering context, may not get to the root of the issue, helps to perpetuate stigma around retractions, and may deter researchers from stepping forward when they become aware of major concerns. Authors who proactively reach out to request retraction when they discover an error with their paper should be applauded rather than punished. </span><b>Is this view changing? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional and funding body representatives would be better placed than publishers to answer this, although publishers can do their part by providing clear information in retraction notices as to the reasons for retraction, and by notifying the relevant parties in cases where an institutional investigation may be warranted. </span></p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you think questions/concerns raised on places like pubpeer should be anonymous and without any accompanying declaration of Conflicts of Interests?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong>&nbsp; It is helpful to give readers the option of listing their name or posting anonymously according to their personal preference. Anonymity can help readers to express concerns without fear of reprisal, particularly in cases where one raises concerns about work by a colleague, collaborator, or researcher who may contribute to one&rsquo;s own career (e.g. via grant review). On the other hand, if a reader is comfortable providing their name &ndash; whether on a public site such as Pubpeer or in a personal communication to the journal/publisher &ndash; then they can obtain public credit for their observations (if they self-identify publicly), and the journal/publisher can follow up with them directly to ask for any clarifications and provide an update when the case is resolved. I am a proponent of transparently declaring potential conflicts of interest, but I appreciate that in some cases these interests may be identifying. At PLOS, we follow up on concerns about our content whether or not the person raising them has potential conflicts. Importantly, we focus our investigations on the issues, article content, and evidence (e.g. primary data), not on the person who raised the concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: How much evidence do journals need to raise questions about scientific integrity of data?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch: </strong>We investigate every claim that calls into question the integrity of any paper we publish, but we need readers to provide specific details as to the nature of the concerns and which results are in question. In cases involving data integrity concerns, if a reader has already done an analysis or made an observation that supports their concerns, then providing details of the analysis and/or findings can greatly aid in our assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Journal-specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is there a time limitation post publication to file a grievance with a Journal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>No. However, some universities and research institutions have time limits as to when they will investigate concerns, and this can present a barrier to journal-level work in some cases.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why do journals refuse the self-citation and consider it as plagiarism?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> We do not refuse self-citation, i.e. citation of one&rsquo;s previous works. However, re-using previously published content without citing the original source is misleading and in some cases may present copyright concerns. Also, authors should not preferentially cite their own works over others, rather they should discuss the relevant literature in a balanced manner that accurately represents the current state of the field, giving due attribution to all key contributors.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not publish in an Appendix anonymized reviewer comments and author responses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> While the standard in the field has historically been to hold peer review as confidential, some publishers and other stakeholders have recently taken steps toward opening up peer review and providing transparency as to the article assessment process. Since 2019, PLOS has offered authors the option of publishing peer review history (review reports and decision letters) alongside accepted research articles. We use a separate tab on article pages for peer review history rather than an Appendix. This allows interested readers to navigate easily through the various documents. While we encourage this transparency with regard to article assessment, it is not mandatory. For additional discussion of transparent peer review, see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/08/transparency-credit-and-peer-review/">here</a> and<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/"> here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not routinely provide the public with the possibility of evaluating scientific conclusions through links to the evidence on which conclusions are based?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This is one of the primary objectives of the open data movement which has made great strides over the past decade. PLOS has a Data Availability policy, which was updated in 2014 to require that authors make publicly available the minimal dataset underlying an article&rsquo;s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think the timeliness concerns are related to the workforce crisis in peer review?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; I am answering this under the assumption that &lsquo;timeliness concerns&rsquo; refer to concerns about the timeliness of research publication, i.e. the time required for submissions to undergo peer review process. There are several factors that contribute to this, including difficulties securing peer reviewers who are suitable, willing, and available to contribute to the process. This could be improved by having increasingly effective tools to help editors find suitable reviewers, and by having peer review contributions formally recognized or even required by tenure and promotion committees and hiring managers. Reviewers for PLOS have the option of linking peer review contributions via their ORCID profiles in cases where they are willing to self-identify as reviewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: What are some ways to encourage the inclusion of a Limitations section in every paper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This could be encouraged through training and reinforcement. Institutions and established investigators could provide (or even require) research reporting training for early career researchers, and one aspect of this training could be to emphasize the importance of discussing limitations as a standard section within each research article. This training can then be reinforced through peer review: as part of their evaluation, reviewers and handling editors should consider whether a manuscript adequately addresses a study&rsquo;s limitations and assumptions, and request revisions to add or improve upon this where needed. If researchers themselves have been trained to recognize the importance of this section, they will look for it in the articles they evaluate as reviewers. Journals could also include a section on Limitations in their submission guidelines, but ultimately it will be the handling editors and reviewers who evaluate the scientific content of each submission and provide feedback on this type of reporting issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you feel that there needs to be more of an effort to educate/reinforce an understanding of the process of peer review to increase trust in results?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; To increase trust in results, it may be more effective to focus resources on (a) improving adoption of open data practices, (b) emphasizing the importance of critically evaluating primary research literature, (c) encouraging reproducibility efforts and publication of both confirmatory and contradictory results, and (d) ensuring that news articles and other public discussions accurately summarize the findings without over-hyping or overstating the study&rsquo;s results. Increasing awareness and understanding of peer review &ndash; including its strengths and limitations &ndash; may help by informing how the general audience approaches research reports. For example, this may help readers better appreciate the difference between peer-reviewed work that has been vetted by experts in the field and non-peer-reviewed articles (including pre-prints) that may not have been critically assessed before posting/publication.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Questions related to news and promotion:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think that journal press offices should proactively flag their (high-profile) retractions to journalists as well to ensure trust in science?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Dave Knutson, Sr. Manager, Communications: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, but with a caveat: Only if the journal publicized the paper when it was originally published. They have a responsibility to correct the public record. However, for journals like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, publicly calling out every retraction would end up being white noise to the public. </span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: On what basis do journalists decide what topics to cover or publicize?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson::</strong> This may not seem satisfying, but it&rsquo;s years of honing one&rsquo;s news judgment. Journalists are constantly asking themselves: What does my audience need to know? And that question differs for every outlet. A reporter for the LA Times will answer that question differently than a journalist affiliated with the BBC. That said, here are some other considerations: Timeliness (is it happening now?), Progress (is it new?), Emotion (is there a human element?), Consequence (how many people will it affect/impact?), Proximity (is this a local story?), Conflict (are there differing opinions?) and is it unusual.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What do you think about the role that university press offices play in disseminating hyped up science?</strong></p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p><b>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Press officers have a key role in communicating science accurately. Research (for example, </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168217"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) suggests that when press releases contain &ldquo;hyping&rdquo; language &ndash; unwarranted casual claims, explicit health advice, and so on &ndash; subsequent news coverage is more likely also to contain these exaggerations. Meanwhile, inclusion of appropriate caveats and limitations in press releases is linked with their increased inclusion in news coverage. Since the more cautious, accurate press releases are not associated with reduced news coverage, there&rsquo;s no reason for press officers not to communicate with measured language and messages that we&rsquo;re confident will stand up to scrutiny &ndash; and that&rsquo;s certainly our aim at PLOS. Although university press officers in particular are under increasing pressure to &ldquo;market&rdquo; their institution and its research, I&rsquo;ve also found all those I work with to be dedicated to prioritizing communication that accurately reflects the science &ndash; which is as it should be.</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: Is there a difference between promoting preprints and promoting unpublished research presented at e.g. conferences?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager: </strong>Preprints and conference presentations are similar in that both may include research which has not (yet!) been peer-reviewed. Both are intended for an audience of researchers &ndash; for example, to share results early with colleagues &ndash; who are well-qualified to evaluate the science. At PLOS, we recommend against active promotion of either type of unpublished research, instead advising that authors and press officers wait until after peer review. The main difference between preprints and conference presentations in this respect is a practical one: while only conference attendees will see presentations, preprint servers are generally open to everyone, making it more likely that journalists will reach out to authors. We always recommend that if researchers choose to engage with such requests, they stress that their work is still undergoing peer review &ndash; and may be subject to change as a result.</p>



<h2><strong>Random questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: How can journal editors ensure that studies conducted in low resource contexts do not have author teams excluding local scientists? This erodes local trust</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson:</strong> We agree and last year announced this <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy </a>regarding inclusion in global research. You can also read this editorial in <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004099">PLOS Medicine</a></em>.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The effort to enhance access often doesn&rsquo;t get acknowledged or rewarded in the promotion/tenure process. Is that a barrier to the work you&rsquo;re trying to do?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Dan Morgan, Director of Communications and Community Relations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS, and any publisher or organization committed to Open Science and Open Access would love to see Open publishing and research practices acknowledged and rewarded more. That would certainly be a key driver in an activity (scholarly communication) driven by acknowledgement and progress. However, we also believe authors choose Open practices as a matter of scientific integrity, and not just reward, especially when they are minor behavioral shifts with meaningful reputational and scientific benefits. If authors believe there is an Open Science practice that is discouraged, or an Open Science practice that is not worth the effort UNLESS it is rewarded, we would love to hear about it so we can shine a light on the best ways the Open Science community can help!</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: What are your thoughts on single-blinded review processes? How can we ensure high quality and non conflicting peer-reviews?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team: </strong>PLOS uses a single-anonymized peer review model in which reviewers know authors&rsquo; identities by default, but reviewer identities remain hidden. We also offer reviewers the opportunity to sign their reviews if they wish to do so (about 18% choose to sign across all submissions and journals).</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen a single-anonymized review as our default (over double-anonymized) for several reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Hiding author identities prevents the disclosure of COIs, and its effectiveness at limiting bias in peer review is questionable, since studies suggest reviewers can guess the identities of authors (or think they can)</li><li>Research suggests that, in cases where double-anonymized peer review is optional, reviewers are more critical of authors who choose to conceal their identities&ndash;introducing perhaps a new form of bias</li><li>Single-anonymized review with the option to sign allows reviewers to provide an honest critique without fear of retribution, while at the same time giving them the flexibility to share their identity when they feel comfortable doing so</li></ul>



<p>We do not necessarily see conflicting or contradictory reviews as a bad thing. Indeed, gathering insight from different perspectives is one of the great benefits of having more than one expert reviewer. Such discrepancies can indicate that something in the article is open to interpretation and requires clarification, or they may result from differences in the reviewers&rsquo; specific expertise. Identifying and understanding these issues is valuable to the assessment and selection process. We ask our editors to take any differences in reviewer feedback into account during decision-making, and to indicate which changes they agree with and would expect to see in a revision.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing:</strong></h2>



<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank all of our panelists for sharing their expertise with us. It was a rich discussion, which led to a lot of thought provoking questions. We hope this debate continues far beyond Peer Review Week.

<h2>arXiv Giving Week, October 24 &#8211; 30, 2022</h2>
<p>A researcher once told us that arXiv was &#8220;like air.&#8221; In other words, totally necessary, free&#8230; and easy to take for granted. arXiv is not free to operate, and we rely on the generosity of members, donors, and our major funders to cover basic operating costs. We encourage everyone who values arXiv and open access to consider donating. And whether or not you are able to contribute, please consider sharing this request with your colleagues by email or on social media. Just think, if half of arXiv&#8217;s visitors this month donated $5, our annual budget would be covered, with room to breathe.</p>
<p><a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/giving/interior.aspx?sid=1717&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=22315&amp;cid=35778&amp;dids=276&amp;bledit=1&amp;sort=1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-738 size-full" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Donate-Button.png" alt="Donate Button" width="100" height="58" /></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-worm-evolution-missing-link">This ancient worm might be an important evolutionary missing link</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ancient, armored worm may be the key to unraveling the evolutionary history of a diverse collection of marine invertebrates.</p>



<p>Discovered in China, a roughly 520-million-year-old fossil of the newly identified worm, dubbed <em>Wufengella</em>, might be the missing link between three of the phyla that constitute a cadre of sea creatures called lophophorates.</p>



<p>Based on a genetic analysis, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wufengella</em></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is probably the common ancestor</a> that connects brachiopods, bryozoans and phoronid worms, paleontologist Jakob Vinther and colleagues report September 27 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“We had been speculating that [the common ancestor] may have been some wormy animal that had plates on its back,” says Vinther, of the University of Bristol in England. “But we never had the animal.”</p>



<p>Roughly half a billion years ago, nearly all major animal groups burst onto the scene in a flurry of evolutionary diversification during what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Cambrian explosion</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>). During this time, lophophorates experienced a rapid growth of species, which has obscured the group’s evolutionary history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3118298" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118298">This <em>Wufengella</em> fossil, found in China, is roughly 520 million years old and sports several features common to sea creatures known as lophophorates.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118298">Jakob Vinther and Luke Parry</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One thing that ties together the different phyla of the group is their tentacle-like feeding tubes known as lophophores. But beyond that commonality, the phyla are all quite different. Brachiopods are shelled animals that at first glance resemble clams. Bryozoans — commonly known as moss animals — are microscopic sedentary critters that live in corallike colonies. And phoronids, or horseshoe worms, are unsegmented, soft-bodied creatures that live in stationary, tubelike structures. (More recently, some researchers have determined that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-oddball-invertebrate-finds-its-place-tree-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyoliths</a> — an extinct animal known by their conical shells (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>) — are also lophophorates because of the tentacled organ that surrounds their mouth.)</p>



<p><em>Wufengella</em> doesn’t belong to any of these phyla, Vinther and his colleagues found. But the critter has characteristics similar to those of brachiopods, horseshoe worms or bryozoans: a series of asymmetric, armored back plates, a wormlike body and bristles that stick out from lobes surrounding its body.</p>





<p>The fossil is a “great find,” says Gonzalo Giribet, an invertebrate zoologist at Harvard University who was not involved in the research. Still, the scientists’ analysis does not confirm that <em>Wufengella</em> is the long-sought missing link, he cautions, but rather suggests it.</p>



<p>Some researchers had hypothesized that lophophorates’ common ancestor would be a stationary creature that sat on the seafloor and fed only through tubes, similar to its modern kin. The <em>Wufengella</em> fossil could refute this idea; the animal’s body plan suggests instead that it crawled around, the researchers say.<a></a></p>



<p>A fossil like <em>Wufengella </em>had long been high on Vinther’s bucket list of fossils that he and his colleagues hoped to find. But “we always thought, ‘Well, we probably will never see that in real life,’” he says. Typically, such a creature would have spent its life in shallow water. Organisms don’t tend to preserve well there, decaying faster due to exposure to lots of oxygen. Vinther suggests that the <em>Wufengella</em> that his team found probably washed out to deep water in a storm.</p>



<p>Now that the researchers have found one <em>Wufengella</em>, they hope to find more, in part to see if there are other varieties. And perhaps the team could identify even more distant ancestors further back on the tree of life that might connect lophophorates with other animal groups such as mollusks, Vinther says, further fleshing out how life on Earth is connected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mesopotamia-city-marsh-islands-drone-lagash-iraq">Drone photos reveal an early Mesopotamian city made of marsh islands</a></h4>

              
                <p>A ground-penetrating eye in the sky has helped to rehydrate an ancient southern Mesopotamian city, tagging it as what amounted to a Venice of the Fertile Crescent. Identifying the watery nature of this early metropolis has important implications for how urban life flourished nearly 5,000 years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where modern-day Iraq lies.</p>



<p>Remote-sensing data, mostly gathered by a specially equipped drone, indicate that a vast urban settlement called Lagash largely consisted of four marsh islands connected by waterways, says anthropological archaeologist Emily Hammer of the University of Pennsylvania. These findings add crucial details to an emerging view that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2022.101458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southern Mesopotamian cities did not, as traditionally thought, expand outward from temple</a> and administrative districts into irrigated farmlands that were encircled by a single city wall, Hammer reports in the December <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>“There could have been multiple evolving ways for Lagash to be a city of marsh islands as human occupation and environmental change reshaped the landscape,” Hammer says.</p>



<p>Because Lagash had no geographical or ritual center, each city sector developed distinctive economic practices on an individual marsh island, much like the later Italian city of Venice, she suspects. For instance, waterways or canals crisscrossed one marsh island, where fishing and collection of reeds for construction may have predominated.</p>



<p>Two other Lagash marsh islands display evidence of having been bordered by gated walls that enclosed carefully laid out city streets and areas with large kilns, suggesting these sectors were built in stages and may have been the first to be settled. Crop growing and activities such as pottery making may have occurred there.</p>



<p>Drone photographs of what were probably harbors on each marsh island suggest that boat travel connected city sectors. Remains of what may have been footbridges appear in and adjacent to waterways between marsh islands, a possibility that further excavations can explore.</p>



<p>Lagash, which formed the core of one of the world’s earliest states, was founded between about 4,900 and 4,600 years ago. Residents abandoned the site, now known as Tell al-Hiba, around 3,600 years ago, past digs show. It was first excavated more than 40 years ago.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Hidden city</h3>



<p>Drone photos taken across a massive site in southern Iraq revealed that buried structures, shown in yellow, from the ancient Mesopotamian city of Lagash clustered in four sectors that had probably been marsh islands. Walls, shown in red, surrounded two large sectors. Now-dry waterways, shown in dark blue, connected sectors and crisscrossed one sector, far right.</p>

<p>Previous analyses of the timing of ancient wetlands expansions in southern Iraq conducted by anthropological archaeologist Jennifer Pournelle of the University of South Carolina in Columbia indicated that Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities were built on raised mounds in marshes. Based on satellite images, archaeologist Elizabeth Stone of Stony Brook University in New York has proposed that Lagash consisted of around 33 marsh islands, many of them quite small.</p>



<p>Drone photos provided a more detailed look at Lagash’s buried structures than possible with satellite images, Hammer says. Guided by initial remote-sensing data gathered from ground level, a drone spent six weeks in 2019 taking high-resolution photographs of much of the site’s surface. Soil moisture and salt absorption from recent heavy rains helped the drone’s technology detect remnants of buildings, walls, streets, waterways and other city features buried near ground level.</p>



<p>Drone data enabled Hammer to narrow down densely inhabited parts of the ancient city to three islands, she says. A possibility exists that those islands were part of delta channels extending toward the Persian Gulf. A smaller, fourth island was dominated by a large temple.</p>



<p>Hammer’s drone probe of Lagash “confirms the idea of settled islands interconnected by watercourses,” says University of Chicago archaeologist Augusta McMahon, one of three co–field directors of ongoing excavations at the site.</p>



<p>Drone evidence of contrasting neighborhoods on different marsh islands, some looking planned and others more haphazardly arranged, reflect waves of immigration into Lagash between around 4,600 and 4,350 years ago, McMahon suggests. Excavated material indicates that new arrivals included residents of nearby and distant villages, mobile herders looking to settle down and slave laborers captured from neighboring city-states.</p>



<p>Dense clusters of residences and other buildings across much of Lagash suggest that tens of thousands of people lived there during its heyday, Hammer says. At that time, the city covered an estimated 4 to 6 square kilometers, nearly the area of Chicago.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dawn-city">northern Mesopotamian cities from around 6,000 years</a> ago, which were not located in marshes, contained separate city sectors (<em>SN: 2/5/08</em>). But Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities likely exploited water transport and trade among closely spaced settlements, enabling unprecedented growth, says archaeologist Guillermo Algaze of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Lagash stands out as an early southern Mesopotamian city frozen in time, Hammer says. Nearby cities continued to be inhabited for a thousand years or more after Lagash’s abandonment, when the region had become less watery and sectors of longer-lasting cities had expanded and merged. At Lagash, “we have a rare opportunity to see what other ancient cities in the region looked like earlier in time,” Hammer says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-mummies-fossils-paleontology">Dinosaur ‘mummies’ may not be rare flukes after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>It might be easier for dinosaurs to “mummify” than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Unhealed bite marks on fossilized dinosaur skin suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the animal’s carcass was scavenged before being covered in sediment</a>, researchers report October 12 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. The finding challenges the traditional view that burial very soon after death is required for dinosaur “mummies” to naturally form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new research centers on Dakota, an <em>Edmontosaurus</em> fossil unearthed in North Dakota in 1999. About 67 million years ago, Dakota was a roughly 12-meter-long, duck-billed dinosaur that ate plants. Today, Dakota’s fossilized limbs and tail still contain large areas of well-preserved, fossilized scaly skin, a striking example of dinosaur “mummification.”</p>





<p>The creature isn&#8217;t a true mummy because its skin has turned into rock, rather than being preserved as actual skin. Researchers have come to refer to such fossils with exquisitely preserved skin and other soft tissues as mummies.</p>



<p>In 2018, paleontologist Clint Boyd of the North Dakota Geological Survey in Bismarck and colleagues began a new phase of cleaning up and examining the dinosaur fossil. The team had found what looked like tears in the tail skin and puncture holes on the animal’s right front foot. To investigate what may have caused the skin marks, the researchers teamed up with Stephanie Drumheller, a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, to remove extra rocky material around the marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The holes in the skin — particularly those on the front limb — are a close match for bite wounds from prehistoric relatives of modern-day crocodiles, the researchers say. “This is the first time that’s been seen in dinosaurian soft tissues,” Drumheller says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the marks on the tail are larger than those on the front limb, the team thinks that at least two carnivores munched on the <em>Edmontosaurus</em> carcass, probably as scavengers because the wounds didn&#8217;t heal. But scavenging doesn’t fit into the traditional view of mummification.</p>



<p>“This assumption of rapid burial has been baked into the explanation for mummies for a while,” Drumheller says. That clearly wasn’t the case for Dakota. If scavengers had enough time to snack on its body, then the deceased dino had been out in the open for a while.</p>



<p>Observing Dakota’s deflated skin envelope, shrink-wrapped to the underlying bone with no muscle or other organs, Drumheller had an unexpected “eureka moment,” she says. “I had seen something like this before. It just wasn&#8217;t in the paleontological literature. It was in the forensics literature.”</p>



<p>When some smaller modern scavengers like raccoons feed on the internal organs of a larger carcass, the scavengers rip open the carcass’s body. The forensics research showed that this hole gives any gasses and fluids from further decomposition an escape route, allowing the remaining skin to dry out. Burial could happen afterward.</p>



<p>The researchers “make a very good point,” says Raymond Rogers, a researcher at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., who studies how organisms decay and fossilize and wasn&#8217;t involved in the research. “It would be very unlikely for a carcass to achieve advanced stages of desiccation and also experience rapid burial. These two generally presumed prerequisites for mummification seem to be somewhat incompatible.”</p>



<p>Fossilization of soft tissues — like skin or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ancient-horseshoe-crab-brain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fleshy-comb-first-found-dinosaur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fleshy head combs</a> — is uncommon, but not unheard of (<em>SN: 8/20/21</em>; <em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).&nbsp;“If [soft tissue] requires some spectacular confluence of weird events to get it fossilized at all, it&#8217;s far more common than then you would expect if that was the case,” Drumheller says. Perhaps, then, mummies originating from common carcass fates could explain this.</p>



<p>But while dry, “jerkylike” skin could survive long enough to be buried, the conditions involved aren’t necessarily common, says Evan Thomas Saitta, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>“I still suspect that this actual process is a very precise sequence of events, where if you get the timing wrong, you end up without a mummy dinosaur,” he says.</p>



<p>Understanding that sequence of events, and just how common it is, requires figuring out how fossilization proceeds after a mummy’s burial. This is an area of research that Boyd says he’s interested in looking into next.</p>



<p>“Is it just the same fossilization process as for the bones?” he asks. “Or do we also need a different set of geochemical conditions to then fossilize the skin?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-nerve-cell-rat-brain-organoi">Clumps of human nerve cells thrived in rat brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>To coax human nerve cells in a laboratory to thrive, there are three magic words: location, location, location.</p>



<p>Many experiments grow human nerve cells in lab dishes. But a new study enlists some real estate that’s a bit more unconventional: the brain of a rat. Implanted clusters of human <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05277-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurons grow bigger and more complex</a> than their cohorts grown in dishes, researchers report online October 12 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the human cells also appear functional, albeit in very limited ways. The implanted human cells can both receive signals from rat cells and influence the rats’ behavior, connections that “demonstrate more substantial integration of the transplanted neurons,” says Arnold Kriegstein, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is a significant advance.”</p>





<p>Over the last decade, scientists have been building increasingly complex brain organoids, 3-D clusters of cells derived from stem cells that grow and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-build-human-brain">mimic the human brain</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/18</em>). These organoids don’t re-create the full complexity of human neurons that develop in an actual brain. But they can be windows into an otherwise inscrutable process — human brain development, and how it can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-human-organoids-personalized-cluster-cells-study-disorders">go awry</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/21</em>). “Even if they’re not entirely perfect, [these models] are surrogates for human cells in a way that animal cells are not,” Kriegstein says. “And that’s really exciting.”</p>



<p>To push these cells closer to their full potential, Sergiu Pasca, a neuroscientist at the Stanford School of Medicine, and colleagues surgically implanted human cerebral organoids into the brains of newborn rat pups. Along with their hosts, the human organoids began to grow. Three months later, the organoids were about nine times their starting volume, ultimately making up about a third of one side of the rat’s cortex, the outer layer of the brain. “It pushes the rat cells aside,” Pasca says. “It grows as a unit.”</p>



<p>These human cells flourished because rats’ brains offer perks that lab dishes can’t, such as blood supply, a precise mix of nutrients and stimulation from nearby cells. This environmental support coaxed individual human neurons to grow bigger — six times as large by one measure — than the same sort of cells grown in dishes. Cells grown in the rat brains were also more complex, with more elaborate branching patterns and more cell connections called synapses.</p>

<p>The cells looked more mature, but Pasca and his colleagues wanted to know if the neurons would behave that way, too. Tests of electrical properties showed that implanted neurons behaved more similarly to cells that develop in human brains than cells grown in dishes.</p>



<p>Over months of growth, these human neurons made connections with their rat host cells. The human organoids were implanted in the somatosensory cortex, a part of the rat brain that handles whisker input. When researchers puffed air at the whiskers, some of the human cells responded.</p>



<p>What’s more, the human cells could influence the behavior of the rat. In further experiments, the researchers genetically tweaked the organoids to respond to blue light. Prompted by a flash of light, the neurons fired signals, and researchers rewarded the rats with water. Soon, the rats learned to move to the water spout when their human organoid cells sent signals.</p>



<p>In behavioral tests, rats with human implants didn’t show signs of higher intelligence or memory; in fact, researchers were more concerned with deficits. The human organoids were nudging out their hosts’ brains, after all. “Will there be memory deficits? Will there be motor deficits? Will there be seizures?” Pasca asked. But after extensive tests, including behavior tests, EEGs and MRIs, “we could not find differences,” Pasca says.<br><br>Other experiments included nerve cells from people with a genetic disorder called Timothy syndrome, a severe developmental disorder that affects brain growth. Growing organoids created with these patients’ cells in rats’ brains might reveal differences that other techniques would not, the researchers reasoned. Sure enough, neurons in these organoids had less complex message-receiving dendrites than those from organoids derived from people without the syndrome.</p>



<p>Organoids made from patient-specific cells could one day even serve as test subjects for treatments, Pasca says. “Challenging disorders will require bold approaches,” he says. “We will need to build human models that recapitulate more aspects of the human brain to study these uniquely human conditions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">NASA’s DART mission successfully shoved an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>It worked! Humanity has, for the first time, purposely moved a celestial object.</p>



<p>As a test of a potential asteroid-deflection scheme, NASA’s DART spacecraft shortened the orbit of asteroid Dimorphos by 32 minutes — a far greater change than astronomers expected.</p>



<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">rammed into the tiny asteroid</a> at about 22,500 kilometers per hour on September 26 (<em>SN: 9/26/22</em>). The goal was to move Dimorphos slightly closer to the larger asteroid it orbits, Didymos.</p>





<p>Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose any threat to Earth. DART’s mission was to help scientists figure out if a similar impact could nudge a potentially hazardous asteroid out of harm’s way before it hits our planet.</p>



<p>The experiment was a smashing success. Before the impact, Dimorphos orbited Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroid-s-motion-in-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the orbit was 11 hours and 23 minutes</a>, NASA announced October 11 in a news briefing.</p>

At closest approach, LICIACube was about 59 kilometers from the asteroids.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118281">ASI, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For the first time ever, humanity has changed the orbit of a planetary body,” said NASA planetary science division director Lori Glaze.</p>



<p>Four telescopes in Chile and South Africa observed the asteroids every night after the impact. The telescopes can’t see the asteroids separately, but they can detect periodic changes in brightness as the asteroids eclipse each other. All four telescopes saw eclipses consistent with an 11-hour, 23-minute orbit. The result was confirmed by two planetary radar facilities, which bounced radio waves off the asteroids to measure their orbits directly, said Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>The minimum change for the DART team to declare success was 73 seconds — a hurdle the mission overshot by more than 30 minutes. The team thinks the spectacular plume of debris that the impactor kicked up gave the mission extra oomph. The impact itself gave some momentum to the asteroid, but the debris flying off in the other direction pushed it even more — like a temporary rocket engine.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting and promising result for planetary defense,” Chabot said. But the change in orbital period was just 4 percent. “It just gave it a small nudge,” she said. So knowing an asteroid is coming is crucial to future success. For something similar to work on an asteroid headed for Earth, “you’d want to do it years in advance,” Chabot said. An upcoming space telescope called <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/near-earth-object-surveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Near-Earth Object Surveyor</a> is one of many projects intended to give that early warning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy">The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac90ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, </a>&nbsp;astronomers report in the Oct. 1<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.</p>





<p>Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723</a>, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.</p>



<p>For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/globular-star-cluster-surprising-few-heavy-elements">wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters</a>, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (<em>SN: 10/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">cosmic dawn</a>,” when stars were first able to form at all (<em>SN: 3/4/22</em>)?</p>



<p>Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg" alt="galaxy cluster SMACS 0723" class="wp-image-3118215" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-585x383.jpg 585w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-284x186.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118215">Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118215">L. Mowla <em>et al</em>/<em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.</p>



<p>“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.</p>



<p>In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.</p>



<p>Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.</p>



<p>Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”</p>
