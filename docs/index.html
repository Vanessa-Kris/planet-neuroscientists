<h4>And other consequences of rewarding quantity, not quality</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8DNJNjcUxIbe9xYMJI95Zg.jpeg" />Credit: Pixabay/holdentrils</figure><p>Name me the exceptional things you do once every five days. Not the basics of your ablutions, your plumbing, and stuffing your cake-hole with, um, cake. Not the daily cycle of home-work-home-TV. But the extra-ordinary things, the things that take that little extra effort. Watching a film at the cinema; playing sport; entertaining friends? Bathing the elephant; crocheting a teddy bear; continuing construction of your Lego cerebellum granule cell layer?</p><p>How about publishing a scientific paper? A singular work of deep scholarship, analysis, or experiment, publishing a scientific paper is an exceptional thing by anyone’s standards. A recent report in <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8">has revealed</a> a select group of scientists who published one paper every five days for at least a year. One paper every five days.</p><p>That means each of these scientists was listed among the authors on at least 72 papers in a single calendar year. And these were not the thousand-plus lists of authors on papers from particle physics, not those gigantic teams of atom-smashers at CERN. These were papers about research into the effects of genes within large populations, or tracking human health over our lifespan, or neurology. Research that some would consider everyday, run-of-the-mill science.</p><p>There are many possible reactions to this hyper-productive cadre. Some would feel the sting of inadequacy, contemplating how they sweated and bled on the torturous path to build one paper, and wondering how they took such a long and winding road when there exist scientists who can apparently produce effortlessly. Others would interpret the same contemplation of their own experience as awe, placing such evidently extraordinary scientific talents on a pedestal.</p><p>The sensible reaction is of the absurd. At that prodigious rate, the scientists who authored more than 72 papers a year are unlikely even to have read all of them. Let alone contributed directly to the work inside, writing a few words or providing some key idea. Let alone doing some meaningful science in their construction.</p><p>At this point, you may be permitted to think “what the fork!?” The mere existence of papers whose authors haven’t even read them is the big red flag that the exponential increase in scientific output is showing no signs of slowing down. Rough estimates claim somewhere between one to two million scientific papers are published every year. That’s 5470 every single day.</p><p>Which begs the question: who are these papers for? Who are those one paper every 5 days for, if even their own authors have not read them?</p><p>Possibly, no one.</p><p>There is a nihilistic version of this answer, which runs as follows. Papers exist as the productive unit of science. Measuring science by its papers reduces it to a time-and-motion study of counting the number of papers and proclaiming brilliance, to the weigh-in of a fishing competition where the heaviest stack of papers is proclaimed the winner. Potted biographies of famous scientists routinely say “Professor X has authored over 300 scientific articles”. And you wonder: really? (And also: how did he fit all that in with Magneto wiping his hard drive every five minutes?). The counting is what counts. Not the content, not the ideas, just the mere existence.</p><p>The less nihilistic version of “no one” is that papers need not have an audience. Indeed, reading many of them, it becomes plain that the authors forget someone else is supposed to read these things, as they dive into their personal patois, piling noun upon noun upon noun until your brain is begging for an adverb, an adjective, hell even a pronoun would do.</p><p>Rather, papers need not have an audience right now, but one day. For there are two types of scientific paper. There are those that give a shove to knowledge: they prove something right (we should all go in this direction); they prove something wrong (stop going in this direction); or they tell of a new method everyone should know about and use immediately. The kind of papers that make the mainstream news. (More accurately, papers dressed up to look like these kinds of shoves to knowledge make the news). These are the papers meant to be read right now. But they are few in number compared to the total outpouring of papers.</p><p>Most papers are archival knowledge. Scientists find something out, make a record of it, and publish it as a paper. Then future scientists can build on it, use it, when there is a reason to. When it becomes apparent, for example, that knowing how a tiny piece of bacterial DNA fends off a virus is the basis for a technique that edits genes in literally anything’s DNA (CRISPR there).</p><p>The archival knowledge idea might be less nihilistic, but it just pushes the problem into the future. Yes, we’d like to know what we already know; we’d like to not repeat the same ideas and experiments. But there is too much archival knowledge to imbibe. It’s like asking for a shot of single-malt whiskey, and getting a firehose of Jack Daniels in your face.</p><p>Take dopamine. I like dopamine, and I’d like to know more about it. PubMed tells me that last year alone there were 4586 papers published on dopamine (in 2017). If I narrow that down to specifically dopamine and reward? 495 papers last year. And apparently five papers have so far been published on this in the future — 2019 (ah, academic publishing there, still so wedded to pre-digital tradition that papers which already exist have to be assigned a monthly “issue” of the journal in which they will formally appear. Despite that journal not having published on dead-tree pulp for a decade. Or ever.)</p><p>I don’t know about you, but the prospect of reading 495 papers on dopamine and reward does not fill my heart with joy. Mainly a dull ache. And explicit tests of dopamine’s role in reward are just a tiny part of that story. Other things we’d like to know include how the neuron itself behaves; what its inputs are; where its outputs go; its responses to things that aren’t reward; its role in Parkinson’s disease; etcetera, etcetera. The archival knowledge about dopamine is growing faster than anyone could possibly comprehend.</p><p>Also I’d like to read something that isn’t about dopamine. About how reward is encoded in prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, perhaps. About habit learning. About reinforcement learning. About cross-validated principal components analysis, because I’m just that cool. About Poppy, her hamster Wilberforce, and their starry-eyed misadventures in DoofusVille avoiding the clutches of Reginald the Malingerer and his hoard of ruffians.</p><p>Neuroscience has no privileged position in The Flood of papers. In his biography of the insanely prolific mathematician Paul Erdos, Paul Hoffman calculated that close to a quarter of a million mathematical theorems were being published every year. Scientists have nothing on the productivity of mathematicians; but we’re drowning all the same.</p><p>Contemplating The Flood leads us to some interesting conclusions.</p><p>No one person can link together the existing web of literature about a single topic. And that web may never stop growing. It’s at the point where a single author of 72 papers a year cannot even link together their own papers.</p><p>Which means there is no single person who will know “the answer” to a given complex problem. So “the answer” can come in one of two guises.</p><p>The first is a computational model of the problem. We see this epitomised in climate research. Huge computer models of the Earth’s climate synthesise an extraordinary amount of data, and bring together a vast array of individual bits of knowledge — about cycles of glacial melt and run-off, of reflections and trapping of sunlight, of feedback between carbon dioxide, temperature, and foliage, to name but a few. The model itself becomes the culmination of a vast research enterprise.</p><p>Running those models gives us answers to complex problems: they might answer the questions of how temperature depends on carbon dioxide, of where those temperature changes will hit hardest and first, and of what changes to the Earth’s environment will stop those temperature changes from careening out of control. And building these models tell us what we <strong>don’t</strong> know, of where we need to fill in the gaps to make the models better, leaner, smarter.</p><p>The second guise is an AI. Groan. But the idea that an AI will someday “know” the answer should come as no surprise. After all, we already use machine-learning extensively to make sense of data-sets that are too big for one person to comb through. And what bigger data-set is there than the collective scientific knowledge of humanity? (Answer: Lego’s database of all possible permutations of small plastic bricks that make money).</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06617-5">It’s already happening</a>. Do you not use Google or PubMed to search the literature? People are already using machine-learning to do systematic literature searches (Iris.ai, Semantic Scholar), to find links between research findings, and show them in a comprehensible form. These are fancy classifiers, learning to group together published work and data-sets by key words. Developments in language processing are beginning to let the machines link findings together to suggest hypotheses, like linking gene expression changes to mental disorders. The next step after that will be to have the machines write the literature reviews, synthesising existing knowledge into a form we mere mortals can understand, and pointing out to us what we don’t know.</p><p>Building a machine to tell us what we don’t know is exactly what <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/05/journal-of-neuroscience-methods-paper.html">Jessica and Bradley Voytek did</a>. Scraping 3.5 million abstracts from PubMed, and linking them by key-words for brain regions, disorders, and cognitive functions, they built a model of neuroscientific knowledge. This model naturally has a hierarchy: “cortex”, “thalamus”, and “striatum” are all children of “brain”, for example. Which opened up a simple but effective hypothesis generator: find two concepts that share a parent, but have not been linked together in the existing literature. That pair of concepts are then candidates for linking together. (One can imagine generalising this even to a flat web of links, by seeking a pair of concepts that are each strongly associated with a third concept, but not (yet) strongly associated with each other.) Here is a dumb machine that already gives answers no human could possibly find on their own.</p><p>And as The Flood grows then, even in narrow disciplines, the machines will be the only ones who know all the links, the only ones that can put together the big picture. So even if we never develop a true AI that can by itself infer new hypotheses and create new ideas, even if that sci-fi scientist is off the table, we will still become dependent on dumb AI for the “answers”.</p><p>If you don’t like these far-flung futures, the paper-every-5-days people still teach us a couple of valuable lessons for the here and now. For one, complaining about your work not being cited is churlish. Literatures are vast, people miss stuff, give them a break. Don’t complain, collaborate: point others to work they may have missed, and explain why it is relevant, and how it might inform their future work.</p><p>Ultimately they teach us that much of what we publish is worthless. I think we can safely say that any paper whose own authors haven’t read it is unlikely to contain ground-breaking information. The lesson to us all is that we should learn to ask: who am I publishing this paper for?</p><p><em>Want more?

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/new-born-615751_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Dr. Stuart Fischbein, MD, FACOG: </strong></p>
<p>I was trained in an era and a hospital that did not see properly selected breech birth as high risk. I have supported this option my entire 32-year career. In 2010, for reasons having nothing to do with outcomes, my hospital system chose to ban vaginal breech birth as well as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). There was no hearing, no discussion, no review of the literature, and certainly no concern for our ethical obligation to offer reasonable choices to our clients and to allow them the option of informed consent and refusal.</p>
<p>Previously, I had been collaborating with and assisting midwives for three decades as a back-up physician for home birth transports. In 2010, I left the hospital and began my home birth career. Unbound by rigid protocols put in place by committees and risk managers, I was free to individualize my care.</p>
<blockquote><p>We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%.</p></blockquote>
<p>During my years in home birth practice, I became aware that we obstetricians project a lot of anxiety onto the women we care for. In healthy women, pregnancy is a normal physiological bodily function that works best when the women are in a safe, private environment. Midwives are experts at normal birth and, in my experience, their model of care leads to better outcomes and higher rates of satisfaction. We, as obstetricians, can learn much from them. A collaborative model, as I have adopted in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our recent study</a>, can lead to better outcomes with less intervention.</p>
<p>Most breech studies compare vaginal breech birth (VBB) to planned cesarean section. We chose to compare VBB to a similar cohort planning vaginal cephalic birth. Selection criteria for breech were more rigid than for cephalic, but outcomes were similar in both groups. Although our numbers were too small to capture rare adverse events, intrapartum transports and perineal integrity were much more related to parity than to presenting part.</p>
<p>While breech birth at home may not be the ideal for most, it remains the <em>only</em> choice for many women in this country other than cesarean for breech birth. We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%. To not offer VBB to these women is professionally irresponsible. Even primiparous breech mothers had a 76% success rate at home. This information deserves a place in informed consent discussions.</p>
<p>Our efforts should not be put into restricting choice but into honoring our ethical obligations to the women we serve. We can support this goal by learning and then teaching the skills that make our profession unique, by supporting colleagues who offer vaginal breech birth, and by advocating for more robust breech training &amp; education from our professional societies.</p>
<p><strong>Rixa Freeze, PhD:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence since the Term Breech Trial is clear that the short-term risks of VBB to the baby are small—sometimes even identical to planned cesarean section (see infographic below).</p>
<p>And we cannot forget the long-term risks of cesarean section to the baby and the short- and long-term risks to the mother. Despite this evidence, VBB is nearly impossible to obtain in the United States. For many women, the <em>only</em> option for a vaginal breech birth is at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our study</a> is the largest of its kind on breech birth at home. Larger datasets exist, but they do not include information about provider skill level, selection criteria, type of breech presentation, or whether the breech presentation was diagnosed before the onset of labor—all factors we addressed in our study.</p>
<p>We found that breech birth at home leads to high rates of vaginal birth and good maternal outcomes (including postpartum transfers, blood loss, and perineal integrity). However, with only 50 breech presentations at the onset of labor, our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about uncommon adverse neonatal outcomes.</p>
<p>We need more high-quality data on home breech outcomes. What if we could analyze 500 home breech births rather than 50?</p>
<p>We are doing women enormous harm by taking away their bodily autonomy when their baby is breech. In theory, state and federal laws support the principle of informed consent and informed refusal, and nearly every hospital has a patient’s bill of rights that ensures consent before medical procedures. Yet we throw these legal and ethical rights away when a baby turns bottom-first.</p>
<p>We can do better. We owe it to the women we care for. Women should not be forced to leave the hospital in order to exercise their right to informed consent. Every woman with a breech baby deserves access to skilled providers <em>in her own community</em> who can support her, whether she chooses a planned cesarean section or a vaginal breech birth.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outrage: It’s absolutely everywhere. Today’s world, particularly the version of it blasted into our brains by social media, offers endless fodder, from big, simmering outrages (climate change and many powerful institutions’ refusal to do anything about it) to smaller quotidian ones (every day, someone, somewhere does something offensive that comes to Twitter’s attention, leading to a gleeful pile-on).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part because of rising awareness of the adverse consequences of unfettered digital-age outrage, and of journalistic treatments like </span><em><a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/april-2015/powerful-crazy-cruel">So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed</a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Jon Ronson (which I interviewed him about </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/jon-ronson-on-monica-lewinsky-and-cybershaming.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outrage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become a particularly potent dirty word in recent years. Outrage, the thinking goes, is an overly emotional response to a confusing world, and drives people to nasty excesses, from simple online shaming to death threats or actual violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a new paper argues that the concept of outrage has gotten too bad a rap and that its upsides, especially as a motivator of collective action and costly helping, have been overlooked. Writing  </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302249"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trends in Cognitive Sciences</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the psychologists Victoria Spring, Daryl Cameron and Mina Cikara detail important questions about outrage that have yet to be answered, and they highlight how certain findings – especially from the “intergroup relations” literature, in contrast to the mostly negative findings from moral psychology – suggest it can serve a useful purpose. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35155"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They cite two experiments, for example, in which “both naturally occurring outrage (about an ongoing conflict) and induced outrage (manipulated via video footage about the conflict) predict[ed] greater support for nonviolent peacemaking policies relative to ‘induced hope’ and ‘neutral’ emotion manipulations. Similarly, women who read that the majority of men harbour hostile sexist beliefs (versus benevolent sexist beliefs or gender-unrelated beliefs) exhibit[ed] increased anger and fury, which predict[ed] intentions to participate—and actual participation—in collective action for equal salaries. By contrast, reappraisal, aimed at reducing negative emotions such as outrage, reduce[d] participants’ reported intentions to engage in political action.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s all fair enough. But arguing that researchers — or anyone else — focus too much on the downsides of outrage feels like an uphill battle to fight in 2018. There are endless, endless examples of online outrage spreading out of control, doing damage most people would view as disproportionate. In 2015, for example, </span><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/victim-of-a-scary-web-shaming-speaks-out.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote about</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a woman who was driven from her home as a result of death threats after she made a failed and offensive joke about a slain law enforcement officer — and as Ronson and others have documented, there are a million stories like this one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, few people would deny that outrage is an important impulse for helping to make the world a better place, and for dealing with those who breach important norms. But there are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aspects of human nature that have fundamentally important purposes, but which can also go haywire in certain contexts — especially given that most of us are now living in situations far removed from those in which our ancestors lived and evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, well, cheeseburgers: Humans have evolved tendencies to seek out high-calorie foods. This tendency helped keep us alive during the evolutionary history that brought us to now. For most of that history, scarcity was the norm — a double bacon cheeseburger, to a European or African peasant hundreds of years ago, would have been a caloric bonanza the likes of which they had never before seen and might never see again. Today, of course, in much of the developed world we’re lucky not to face this sort of paucity of calories. In fact, the situation has improved so much that many of us face the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problem: too many calories, too easily consumed (you can buy a double bacon cheeseburger for just a few pounds, if that, whenever you want). That’s part of the reason countries like the UK and the United States have certain health problems: Many people consume far more calories than they should, because there’s so much affordable energy-rich food everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To argue that researchers or anyone else are failing to see the positive sides of outrage, in 2018, feels a bit like arguing that people are failing to see the positive sides of our desire for rich and fatty foods. It’s true, at a basic level, that it’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re drawn to calories: Without that drive, we wouldn’t survive. But in 2018, for those fortunate to live in food-secure places, no one is wanting for calories, and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">surfeit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of calories is the more important and societally relevant problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, we have so many opportunities, every moment of every day, to express outrage, and so many opportunities to accidentally contribute to disproportionate anger directed at faceless, distant strangers, that it feels as though social media, 24-hour news, and other media innovations are taking a fundamentally important human drive — the ability to get outraged at norm breaches — and blowing it up into something ugly and maladaptive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring and her coauthors conclude their paper by writing that “we hope to promote a more complete view of outrage—as an emotion that might lead to interpersonal antagonism, but that may also act as a lever for activism on a societal scale.” And that’s a worthy goal: There’s a sturdy body of literature showing that emotion, in general, is more likely to get people to act in prosocial ways than dryer, more empirical appeals — there’s a deep truth behind the well-worn </span><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” But that same feeling of righteous anger that can, in one case, lead people to donate to the less fortunate can, in the next, turn those same people against (to take one example) innocent migrants seeking a better life. Outrage is big and messy and hard to contain — we need it, on a fundamental level, but we should never forget its many dangers and the many ways in which it can lead to negative and inhumane outcomes.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-fossil-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Due to our close connection to the land we live on, as well as the daily interactions we have with domesticates and wildlife around us, we may often forget that collectively, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals represent less than half of the ‘leaves’ of the vertebrate tree of life.</p>
<p>Indeed, over 50% of living species of vertebrates are ray-finned bony fishes (Actinopterygii), a clade that has been around for almost half a billion years. Despite being masked by an overall fish-like appearance, actinopterygians comprise fossil and living evolutionary lineages that are, in loose evolutionary terms, as distinct as those of frogs and humans.</p>
<blockquote><p> </p>
<p>†Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet the origins of major ray-fin lineages remain obscure. The assignment of early actinopterygian fossils to the correct branch of the tree of life remains an obstacle to acquiring a more complete picture of vertebrate evolution, and its course through major extinction events.</p>
<p>Typically, ray-finned fossils are found crushed in two dimensions by overlying sediments. This does not allow the observation of tremendously important internal skeletal features (e.g. the braincase, sensory structures and gill bones). Luckily, on rare occasions, carcasses were encrusted quickly in pebble-shaped nodules that secured their three-dimensional preservation, protecting the integrity of internal structures.</p>
<p>Classical investigations, from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, of the internal anatomy of 3D early actinopterygians still form the core of our knowledge on the subject. Early works have employed destructive techniques, such as serial grinding, to describe internal features. As one can imagine, these results were of limited accuracy and are non-reproducible, since the original specimens were destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>The latest Palaeozoic–Mesozoic †Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life. They were the first to evolve the typical ‘ambush predator’ (torpedo-like) body shape, which is nowadays encountered in gars, or needlefish.</p>
<p>Destructive investigations of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes, conducted in the 1920s, pointed towards a close relationship with modern paddlefishes and sturgeons (which are best known for their delicious eggs ‒ caviar). Although widely accepted, this hypothesized close relationship rested on weak anatomical arguments.</p>
<p>In this work, we revisited the internal anatomy of †Saurichthyiformes by employing computed X-ray microtomography on 3D fossils of two species of †<em>Saurichthys</em> from the Early Triassic of Nepal and East Greenland.  This method is non-destructive, and results in high-resolution digital models that can be easily studied from different angles, enabling accurate comparisons with other animals.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10597" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10597 size-large" height="324" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichtys-Skull-1024x518.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Different stages of study of the skull of †Saurichthys from East Greenland. From external anatomical interpretation (top), to digital reconstruction of X-ray tomograms (bottom). Scale bar = 1cm.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We digitally reconstructed internal skeletal structures, such as the braincase, jaws, and gills. We also visualized the spaces that were, in life, occupied by the brain, cranial nerves and blood vessels, as well as the inner ear. This allowed us to infer the shape and/or course of the actual soft-tissue structures. Our reconstructions led to new anatomical discoveries, but also revealed critical flaws in classical works.</p>
<p>Amongst our new discoveries is the presence of large empty spaces in the snout. Additionally, we found that a bone (dermohyal), which was previously thought to be missing in †<em>Saurichthys</em>, was actually fused to another bone (hyomandibula). Both features are primitive. Interestingly, we found that the gill-cover bone architecture of †<em>Saurichthys</em> is very similar to that of modern sturgeons and paddlefishes.</p>
<p>To put this new anatomical knowledge in its evolutionary context, we compared †<em>Saurichthys</em> with a variety of fossil and living ray-finned fishes. With the help of specialized algorithms, we analyzed a large dataset of morphological characters from dozens of bony fishes, in order to trace evolutionary affinities on the basis of anatomical similarities.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10658" style="width: 241px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10658" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-Brain-231x300.png" width="231" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Tomographic renderings of brain, osseus labyrinth and nasobasal canal endocasts of †Saurichthys sp. (NHMD_157546_A)</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Image taken from Article</div></figure>
<p>Contrasting historical phylogenetic hypotheses, the evolutionary trees produced by our analyses do not recover †Saurichthyiformes as closely related to sturgeons and paddlefishes, implying that many of their similarities have likely evolved independently (convergently). However, the lack of internal skeletal data for many other early actinopterygians precludes a clear picture of the early ray-fin tree of life.</p>
<p>There will always be too many fossil fishes out there and not enough time (and resources) to study them.  It might even seem that this work only scratches the surface of early actinopterygian evolution. Yet, through works like this, we are able to better locate specific morphological characters and also fossil species that are responsible for ‘reshuffling’ the branches of the largest partition of the vertebrate tree of life.</p>
<p>The unprecedented anatomical knowledge of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes will doubtlessly form a solid basis for further comparisons with new fossils. Moreover, our research highlights the fact that established classical interpretations of actinopterygian anatomy need to be critically reappraised in light of new material and modern methods of anatomical imaging.</p>

<p>The head of a brown lion. Multiple tiny, green, spinning Catherine wheels with red edges. Colourful fragments of artillery soldiers and figures in uniform and action. Unfamiliar faces of well-groomed men… These are just a few of the hallucinations reported by a group of people with macular degeneration (MD), a common cause of vision loss in people aged over 40.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>About 40 per cent of people with MD – who lose vision in the centre of their visual field but whose peripheral vision is generally unaffected – develop Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), reporting hallucinations that vary from simple flashes of light and shapes to faces, animals and even complex scenes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It has been suggested that CBS might arise as a result of over-responsiveness – “hyper-excitability” – of certain visual regions of the cortex, after they are deprived of normal retinal input. But whether this really is the case –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and why some people with reduced vision or blindness develop them, while others don’t – has not been clear. Now <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31142-4">new work</a> by a team of psychologists at the University of Queensland, Australia, led by David Painter, and published in <i>Current Biology</i>, offers some answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35158"></span></p>
<p>Painter and his team studied eight people with MD and Charles Bonnet syndrome (whose regular hallucinations include those listed at the start of this post); eight age- and gender-matched people with MD but without CBS; and eight matched controls with healthy eyes.</p>
<p>The researchers presented the participants with a series of red and green flickering chequerboard patterns, to stimulate the intact peripheral region of their retinas. Using EEG (electroencephalography)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to monitor the participants’ brain activity, the researchers found a much bigger response to the flickering patterns in the early vision processing regions of the cortex in the people with MD who also have CBS, compared with both the other groups.</p>
<p>None of the CBS participants reported experiencing hallucinations during the study, so hyper-excitability of these visual processing regions does not automatically trigger hallucinations, but does seem to be a feature of the brains of people who are susceptible to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The precise triggers for hallucinations in people with CBS vary. They include low light levels, or watching TV or riding in a car. Exactly how these triggers might interact with the over-responsiveness of the visual cortex to generate hallucinations is yet to be explored.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unlike people with schizophrenia, individuals with CBS usually have no trouble recognising that their hallucinations are not real, and most don’t find them distressing. However a minority do, and further research may lead to treatments, write Painter and his colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Based on our findings, future treatments could aim to down-regulate cortical hyperexcitability in CBS,” they write,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“perhaps through repeated application of non-invasive brain stimulation protocols that induce long-lasting plastic changes in underlying cortical networks.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<strong>Can psychology help your cooking taste better?</strong> Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com">Ginny Smith</a> hears about the importance of food presentation, pairing and sequencing, and how our perception of food is a multi-sensory experience. She and her friends conduct a taste test using “sonic seasonings” that you can also try at home.</p>
<p>Our guests, in order of appearance, are: <a href="https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=zellnerd">Professor Debra Zellner</a> at MontClaire State University and <a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/charles-spence">Professor Charles Spence</a> at Oxford University.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>In recent years, researchers have sought to look under the hood to understand <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/30/psychotherapy-has-drug-like-effect-on-the-brain/">the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy</a>. Not only can such understanding help us hone in on the precise processes that are being acted upon in therapy, thus helping us focus on these gains, they could also show where pharmacological interventions might be complementary, and where they could directly obstruct the therapeutic work. Now a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492717303323?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">systematic review and meta-analysis</a> in <i>Psychiatry Research</i>: <i>Neuroimaging</i> has outlined all we know so far about how therapy changes the depressed brain, and it suggests key changes occur in emotional processing areas.</p>
<p><span id="more-35105"></span></p>
<p>An international team, led by Cynthia Fu and first-author Anjali Sankar at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience in London and the University of East London, conducted a search of the brain imaging literature, looking specifically for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>studies that uncovered the brain changes associated with recovery from depression following various forms of psychotherapy, including CBT and psychodynamic psychotherapy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The 17 papers they gathered hinted at some consistent patterns, such as decreased amygdala activity after therapy when looking at both emotional and more neutral stimuli, but there were also occasional results that were harder to square – for instance one study showed more activation in hippocampal areas while another study found less activation in the very same region. This inconsistency is to be expected for a still-young domain of investigation, especially when different labs are experimenting with different study designs, so shouldn’t be over-interpreted.</p>
<p>Where the review is most valuable is through the use of a meta-analysis of five studies that asked volunteers with depression to look at emotional images in the brain scanner before and after they had undertaken psychotherapy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This showed that, after CBT, patients with major depression showed less activation in the left precentral gyrus. This area is in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>is involved in thinking and reflective processes. People who are depressed exhibit more activity in this area during emotional tasks, which appears to reflect their tendency to over-process and ruminate on thoughts and worries. As such, the reduction in prefrontal cortex activity after therapy may indicate the effectiveness of therapy in discouraging such negative cognitive styles – taking things for what they are rather than using them as a springboard into contemplating a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Another finding was that, after CBT or psychodynamic psychotherapy, patients showed more activation in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the left rostral (pregenual) anterior cingulate (see image above; healthy controls did not show this change, suggesting it was not simply due to the passage of time or practice effects at the image-viewing task). This brain area is strongly connected with core emotion processing regions, including having a suppressing effect on activity in the amygdala. Evidence already suggests that the connections between the anterior cingulate and the amygdala are weaker in major depression, explaining why emotions may feel more overwhelming. So it appears that one of the effects of psychotherapy may be the re-establishment of this damaged connection. The meta-analysis can’t tell us exactly how, but one possibility is through practices such as “cognitive re-appraisal” – finding new ways of interpreting difficult experiences.</p>
<p>Fu and Sankar and the rest of their team emphasise that we’re still in early days of making sense of the relationships between brain changes and clinical response, especially the extent of improvement – for instance, how much does an increase in pleasure in life relate to changes in a particular brain region? They note <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033745">a study from 2012</a> that took this approach, finding that extent of improvement on a depression inventory correlated with the activity change in the anterior cingulate cortex, reinforcing that this may be a key brain region worthy of further examination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, we’re still chipping away at the gargantuan task of mapping how the process of therapy plays out in the neural tissue that sits within our skulls. It’s an endeavour worth continuing – as Sankar and colleagues explain, “Understanding the mechanisms of treatments on brain activity has the potential for developing diagnostic biomarkers and identifying new targets for beneficial forms of treatment”.</p>

A new Open Letter against Plan S appeared on the internet. Presently over 600 scientists are protesting against what they see as a bit totalitarian Open Access initiative by Robert-Jan Smits and his partners from Science Europe. Among the Open Letter signatories are many early career researchers and tenured academics, including two Nobelists.

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In temporal information processing, both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play essential roles. In particular, for interval timing learning, the cerebellum exhibits temporally localized activity around the onset of the unconditioned stimulus, whereas the basal ganglia represents the passage of time by their ramping-up activity from the onset of the conditioned stimulus to that of the unconditioned stimulus. We present a unified computational model of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia for the interval timing learning task. We report that our model reproduces the localized activity in the cerebellum and the gradual increase of the activity in the basal ganglia. These results suggest that the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play different roles in temporal information processing.</p>

<p>In 2016, the unexpected outcome of two votes shook the world: the UK voting to leave the European Union, and the US electing President Donald Trump. Even the pollsters got it wrong – for example, based on the latest polling data, the <i>New York Times</i> gave Clinton an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html">85 per cent chance</a> of winning just the day before the election.</p>
<p>Accurate polling is important for a number of reasons. Poll results influence politicians’ campaign strategies and fundraising efforts; affect market prices and business forecasts; and they can impact voters’ perceptions and even turnout. So, when the polls are wide of the mark – as they were so badly in 2016 – many outcomes are being sent astray by misleading information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But polling is not as simple as just asking a lot of people who they intend to vote for. Polls are often biased by who is motivated enough to respond, and people can be overly-optimistic about the likelihood they will actually vote.</p>
<p>Another factor, outlined by Andy Brownback and Aaron Novotny of the University of Arkansas in their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804318301174">recent paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Experimental and Behavioural Economics</i>, is people feeling the need to conceal their true voting intentions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35133"></span></p>
<p>Socially desirable responding (SDR) can occur when people feel their position is socially unacceptable, like voting against an ethnic minority or female politician, or when revealing their views on sensitive issues such as immigration and same-sex marriage. For instance, it’s plausible that some people told pollsters they were going to vote for Clinton, while actually intending to vote for Trump.</p>
<p>To explore whether this was really happening, Brownback and Novotny conducted three experiments during the 2016 presidential campaign, including a telephone survey of 800 people of voting age in Arkansas, and a survey of almost 2000 US voters on Mechanical Turk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their ingenious method to tease out participants’ true or “implicit” preferences involved presenting those in the “implicit” condition with four statements around hot-button issues like gun control and climate change. The statements were balanced to reflect both conservative and liberal views, such that participants were unlikely to agree with all four. For example, people who agreed with “I think the threat of global warming is exaggerated” tended not to agree with “I prefer presidential candidates who oppose the NRA”, and vice versa. There was also a critical fifth statement, either “I often find myself agreeing with Donald Trump” or “I often find myself agreeing with Hillary Clinton”. In this implicit condition, participants were simply asked to give a total number, from 0 to 5, regarding how many statements they agreed with – the idea being that they would feel their preference for Trump or Clinton was hidden within their overall tally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants’ scores in the implicit condition were later contrasted with the scores of participants in an “explicit” condition, in which they rated how many of the exact same policy statements they agreed with,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and then, completely separately, they answered either, “Do you often find yourself agreeing with Donald Trump, yes or no?” or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you often find yourself agreeing with Hillary Clinton, yes or no?”. In this explicit condition, their candidate preference was totally transparent (more like in a typical poll), and their answer to this final question was added to the number of policy statements they agreed with. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This meant that participants in both conditions had a score out of 5. Because participants in the implicit condition were able to indicate they agreed with Trump without admitting so overtly, then if socially desirable responding was occurring, we would expect the total number of statements agreed with to be higher when Trump featured in the implicit condition than the explicit condition.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the researchers found with the results suggesting people were more likely to express agreement with Trump in the implicit condition, and more likely to agree with Clinton in the explicit condition. Interestingly, the researchers found that there was no significant effect of political ideology, so those with more conservative views weren’t more likely to show socially desirable responding than those with liberal views (based on six questions about economic ideology, covering topics like taxation, government spending and immigration). However, party affiliation did have an effect: registered Democrats in particular were more likely to suggest agreement with Trump in the implicit condition. Party identification, then, seems more important in producing this social desirability effect than the political beliefs that presumably underpin that choice. This is important, because it means socially desirable responding exacerbates the differences between the two parties, suggesting voters in each camp have less in common than they actually do.</p>
<p>While finding evidence of socially desirable responding in polling is interesting, it is unclear how this implicit test method could be used for more accurate polls in future, as the data it produces is too noisy. However, another group of researchers has tried a different approach with more obvious practical implications: asking people who their social circle are voting for. We know that when one person votes, their immediate family and friends are <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Connected-Surprising-Networks-Friends-Everything/dp/0316036137/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">15 per cent more likely</a> to vote too, and it’s likely voting choices are influenced in a similar way.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0302-y">recent paper</a> in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>, Mirta Galesic at the Santa Fe Institute and Max Plank Institute, and colleagues, tested this hypothesis not only with regards to the 2016 US election, but also the 2017 presidential election in France. They found that, in both cases, asking people if and how their social circle intended to vote was a more accurate predictor of the outcome than when participants only provided their own intentions or their prediction of who would win. In fact, in one poll, the researchers found that the social circle question was almost twice as accurate as reporting one’s own intentions (82 per cent vs. 46 per cent) in the five key swing states that lost Clinton the election. Asking about participants’ social circles means they don’t have to reveal their own potentially embarrassing preferences, and it indirectly increases the sample size of the poll itself.</p>
<p>This study was also able to track social influence over time, as the researchers started polling both personal intentions and social circle intentions in July and continued weekly until after the US voted in November. One week before the election, more participants said they would vote for Clinton than Trump. Yet, as early as September, these polls accurately predicted Trump’s win as people reported a swing towards him in their social circles. Not only that, but people who reported an intention to vote differently from their social circle were much more likely to change their own position at the last minute.</p>
<p>Another pattern the researchers observed is how participants’ social circles become echo chambers. In August, supporters of both candidates reported that only around two-thirds of their social circle agreed with them. By November, Trump supporters had become much more homogenised, with 40 per cent reporting that 90 per cent or more of their circle now also supported Trump, relative to only 30 per cent of Clinton supporters saying the same. This could be for a number of reasons: switching support from third parties, deciding to vote when they originally weren’t going to, or even freezing out people who disagreed with their political views.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These complementary strands of research both demonstrate flaws in traditional polling, and ways of addressing them in future. It seems likely that people represent their preferences in a socially desirable light, but it would be difficult to use the statement list methodology to predict an election outcome. Asking about a person’s social circle is a much more effective way of obtaining more accurate results, and also sheds light on other social processes at work. Hopefully this will be adopted more widely going forward, to improve polling accuracy and avoid any last-minute surprises.</p>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) announces that Dr. Gloria Choi is the second biennial Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient. Choi is an Assistant Professor at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. Her research focuses on olfaction and social cues, as well as neuroimmunology and neural circuits. </p>
<p>“I am honored and deeply grateful. Being recognized as the Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award winner adds to my motivation to continue striving for good, exciting and important scientific research,” said Dr. Choi.</p>
<p>Dr. Choi received her Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Neurobiology &amp; Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY, in the laboratory of Nobel Prize-winning researcher Richard Axel. As the 2018 Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient, she will be honored with a special presentation and will give a talk at MPFI’s national Sunposium conference, which takes place March 4-6, 2019 in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p><span class="">“Gloria Choi’s achievements continue to push the boundaries of neuroscience forward, and her ability to bring her full focus, creativity, and intellectual curiosity to a question is being recognized through accolades that include being named one of </span><i class="">Cell </i><span class="">journal’s</span><i class=""> </i><span class="">40 top researchers under 40,” wrote Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute, who nominated Choi for this award. Desimone went on to say that Choi is a “creative and collaborative researcher who is certainly an inspiration to other young scientists.”</span></p>
<p>The Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award is given biennially to recognize a young neuroscience investigator for significant contributions to the scientific community through collaboration, creativity, and curiosity-driven research. In addition to recognizing exceptional achievements, it also serves to support research, inspire young scientists, promote cooperation, and acknowledge the outstanding legacy that Dr. Peter Gruss built throughout his honorable career at the Max Planck Society.</p>

<p>The idea that the language that you speak influences how you think about and experience the world (the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a>) has a long and storied history. A lot of research into the issue has focused on colour perception, and evidence has accumulated that people <span class="Apple-converted-space">whose native languages have different colour categories don’t see the world in quite the same way.</span></p>
<p>Now in a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618782181">new paper</a>, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, Martin Maier and Rasha Abdel Rahman at the Humboldt University of Berlin report that by affecting visual processing at an early stage, such linguistic differences can even determine whether someone will see a coloured shape – or they won’t. “Our native language is thus one of the forces that determine what we consciously perceive,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35102"></span></p>
<p>The wavelengths of light that we perceive as colours form a smooth continuum, but crucially, the colour categories that people use to divide up this spectrum <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/">vary between languages</a>. Maier and Abdel-Rahman studied native Greek-, Russian- and German-speakers for whom these categories differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In both Greek and Russian, there is a dedicated category-word for “light blue” and another for “dark blue” but no specific word for “blue” as a broader category. In German (as in English), people can use qualifiers to refer to “light blue”, “navy blue” or “sky blue”, and so on, but there are no dedicated category words for these shades. On the other hand, in German (also as in English) there is a dedicated word “blue” (blau in German) to cover all the shades of blue. However, Russian, Greek and German alike have a dedicated category word for referring to all shades of “green”, just as we do in English.</p>
<p>Earlier work already showed that having a category term for something – whether it’s an object or a colour – speeds up a person’s ability to identify that item among a host of others. Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between light and dark blue colour patches than English-speakers, for example. Maier and Abdel-Rahman wanted to go further and see whether linguistic colour categories would influence the likelihood of speakers of different languages becoming conscious of something at all.</p>
<p>Maier and Abdel-Rahman first tested 28 native Greek-speakers. In each trial, they were presented with a rapid series of 13 coloured stimuli, made up of geometric shapes against a differently-coloured background. The participants were asked to look out for a grey semi-circle, which always appeared at some point on every trial. The grey semi-circle was simply there to grab the participant’s attention – to make it more touch-and-go as to whether they’d notice any ensuing triangle at all. The critical test was whether participants spotted a coloured triangle when it appeared (which it did in 80 per cent of trials) and whether that varied according to its colour relative to the background.</p>
<p>Crucially, the triangle was either light blue against a dark blue background circle; light green against a dark green circle; or light or dark blue against either a light or dark green background circle. At the end of each trial, the participants were asked “how much” of a triangle they had seen – nothing at all, a slight or strong impression, or a “complete” triangle.</p>
<p>Maier and Abdel-Rahman found that, as they’d expected, the Greek-speakers were more likely to see a triangle when it was light against dark blue (or vice versa) than when it was light green against dark green (or vice versa). This is consistent with the idea that having fundamental linguistic categories for the two types of blue made it more likely that these triangles made it into the participants’ conscious perception.</p>
<p>When the researchers repeated the study with 29 German speakers, they found no difference in detection rates for blue against blue versus green against green triangles. But when they next ran the study on native Russian-speakers (who share the same colour categories as Greek-speakers), they replicated the hit rate pattern they had observed for the Greek-speakers – the Russian-speakers were more likely to perceive the triangle in the blue contrast condition compared with the green contrast condition, just as the researchers expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For the studies on Greek- and German-speakers, Maier and Abdel-Rahman also used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare their participants’ brain activity during the visual tasks. The EEG results supported the idea that native language influences a very early, automatic stage of visual processing – an idea that some other researchers have disputed in the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The present results show for the first time that … our native language – and the color categories we apply within it – can influence whether we consciously perceive a stimulus or not,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The differences in blue vs. green detection rates between Greek/Russian and German participants were not big in statistical terms. Still, “language… seems to play an active role in perception and helps to optimise it in the long run,” the researchers concluded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Part of this group, PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer shares a joint announcement. </em></p>
<p>Transparency in reporting benefits scientific communication on many levels. While specific needs and expectations vary across fields, the effective use of research findings relies on the availability of core information about research materials, data, and analysis. These are the underlying principles that led to the design of the <u><a href="https://cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines/">TOP guidelines</a></u>, which outline a framework that over 1,000 journals and publishers have elected to follow.</p>
<p>In September 2017, the second major TOP guidelines workshop hosted by the <u><a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a></u> led to a <u><a href="https://osf.io/ph3zn/">position paper</a></u> suggesting a standardized approach for reporting, provisionally entitled the TOP Statement.</p>
<p>Based on discussions at that meeting and at the 2017 Peer Review Congress, in December 2017 we convened a working group of journal editors and experts to support this overall effort by developing a minimal set of reporting standards for research in the life sciences. This framework could both inform the TOP statement and serve in other contexts where better reporting can improve reproducibility.</p>
<p>In this “minimal standards” working group, we aim to draw from the collective experience of journals implementing a range of different approaches designed to enhance reporting and reproducibility (e.g. <u><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31072-8">STAR Methods</a></u>), existing life science checklists (e.g. the <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852">Nature Research reporting summary)</a></u>, and results of recent meta-research studying the efficacy of such interventions (e.g. <u><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187245">Macleod et al. 2017</a></u>; <u><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183591">Han et al. 2017</a></u>); to devise a set of minimal expectations that journals could agree to ask their authors to meet.</p>
<p>An advantage of aligning on minimal standards is consistency in policies and expectations across journals, which is beneficial for authors as they prepare papers for publication and for reviewers as they assess them. We also hope that other major stakeholders engaged in the research cycle, including institutional review bodies and funders, will see the value of agreeing on this type of reporting standard as a minimal expectation, as broad-based endorsement from an early stage in the research life cycle would provide important support for overall adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>The working group will provide three key deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>      A “minimal standards” framework setting out minimal expectations across four core areas of materials (including data and code), design, analysis and reporting (MDAR)</li>
<li>      A “minimal standards” checklist intended to operationalize the framework by serving as an implementation tool to aid authors in complying with journal policies, and editors and reviewers in assessing reporting and compliance with policies</li>
<li>      An “elaboration” document or user guide providing context for the “minimal standards” framework and checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>While all three outputs are intended to provide tools to help journals, researchers and other stakeholders with adoption of the minimal standards framework, we do not intend to be prescriptive about the precise mechanism of implementation and we anticipate that in many cases they will be used as a yardstick within the context of an existing reporting system. Nevertheless, we hope these tools will provide a consolidated view to help raise reporting standards across the life sciences.</p>
<p>We anticipate completing draft versions of these tools by spring 2019.  We also hope to work with a wider group of journals, as well as funders, institutions, and researchers to gather feedback and seek consensus towards defining and applying these minimal standards.  As part of this feedback stage, we will conduct a “community pilot” involving interested journals to test application of the tools we provide within the context of their procedures and community. Editors or publishers who are interested in participating are encouraged to contact Veronique Kiermer and Sowmya Swaminathan for more information.</p>
<p>In the current working group, we have focused our efforts on life science papers because of extensive previous activity in this field in devising reporting standards for research and publication.  However, once the life science guidelines are in place we hope that we and others will be able to extend this effort to other areas of science and devise similar tools for other fields.  Ultimately, we believe that a shared understanding of expectations and clear information about experimental and analytical procedures have the potential to benefit many different areas of research as we all work towards greater transparency and the support that it provides for the progress of science.</p>
<p>We are posting this notification across multiple venues to maximize communication and outreach, to give as many people as possible an opportunity to influence our thinking.  We welcome comments and suggestions within the context of any of these posts or in other venues.  If you have additional questions about our work, would like to be informed of progress, or would like to volunteer to provide input, please contact Veronique Kiermer and Sowmya Swaminathan.</p>

<p>Debate about how much a person’s character can and can’t change have occupied psychologists for decades, but a growing consensus is beginning to emerge. While our traits are relatively stable, they are not fixed.</p>
<p>Change is often passive – that is, experience leaves its mark on personality. But excitingly, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/27/you-can-change-your-personality-at-will/">initial findings</a> suggest that we can also change ourselves.</p>
<p>What prior research has so far not addressed, however, is whether simply desiring to change is enough (perhaps by triggering automatic, subtle shifts in our identity and behaviour), or whether we must take deliberate, active steps to change. A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-53132-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> explores this question. The results show once again that wilful personality change is possible, but they also indicate that the mere desire to change is not sufficient. In fact, failing to support one’s goals with concrete action appears to backfire, leading to personality drift in the opposite direction to what was desired.</p>
<p><span id="more-35109"></span></p>
<p>Nathan Hudson at Southern Methodist University and his colleagues recruited 377 psychology students to take part in a 15-week study. At the start the students were told about the “Big Five” personality traits recognised by contemporary mainstream psychology (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) and invited to select any they would like to try to change across the duration of the study. The students chose an average of two traits, most often to lower their Neuroticism (i.e. to be more emotionally stable) or increase their Extraversion; the least popular desired change was to become higher in Agreeableness.</p>
<p>At the study start and through each week of the study, the students completed a 60-item personality test. Also, at the start of every week they selected a maximum of four challenges to try to complete to help them change their personality in the ways they wanted. These challenges, which varied in difficulty, came from a pool of 50 proposed by eleven personality experts. Mostly they involved concrete tasks that reflected acting in ways consistent with the traits that the students wanted to change.</p>
<p>For instance, an easy Extraversion challenge was to say “hello” to a cashier whereas a hard Extraversion challenge was to volunteer to take a leadership role, such as on a class project. An easy Openness challenge was to read a news story about a foreign country; a harder equivalent was to seek out someone with a different opinion and ask them questions to better understand their perspective.</p>
<p>At the end of the week the students logged whether they had achieved the challenges they’d set themselves. The challenge system was adaptive so that it proposed progressively harder challenges to students who were successful during the preceding week (or if students selected the same challenge again, the required frequency was increased). To aid motivation, a reward badge system appeared on-screen when students logged successfully completed challenges.</p>
<p>Consistent with recent personality change theory, the more trait-consistent behavioural challenges that the students successfully completed, the more their personality traits shifted over the course of the study in the direction that they desired (challenge difficulty didn’t seem to make any difference to this key finding).</p>
<p>“The single largest implication of our study,” said Hudson and his team, “is that actively engaging in behaviours designed to change one’s personality traits does, in fact, predict greater amounts of trait growth across time.”</p>
<p>However, accepting but not attaining challenges was associated with trait change in the opposite direction to what was desired. This has important implications for anyone considering embarking on the challenge of changing their personality. “Whether or not volitional change is an advisable pursuit may depend entirely on one’s chances of successfully attaining desired changes” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Hudson’s team doesn’t know for sure why unattained challenges backfired in this way. One possibility is that failing to complete selected challenges was demoralising and led participants to re-evaluate their personality traits in a harsher light. For instance, an introvert who failed to meet the challenge of introducing themselves to a stranger might have adjusted their self-concept to consider themselves even more of an introvert than they had done before.</p>
<p>The study has a number of obvious drawbacks including the use of psychology students (who may have knowledge or expectations that differ from the general public); a reliance on the self-rating of personality; and a correlational design that means it is not possible to attribute the cause of personality change to the completed challenges.</p>
<p>These issues can be addressed by future research that could also look into such questions as which behavioural challenges are most effective at eliciting trait change. For now the main finding is clear and important – as the researchers put it, “Merely desiring change and formulating plans is not enough; it is necessary to follow through.”</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Anna Dumitriu and Alex May (Visiting Research Fellows: Artists in Residence in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire) will discuss their latest projects “ArchaeaBot” and “BioCompuation Bots” and demonstrate some of these new robotic artworks.</p>
<p>“ArchaeaBot: A Post Singularity and Post Climate Change Life-form” takes the form of an underwater robotic installation that explores what ‘life’ might mean in a post singularity, post climate change future. The project is based on new research about archaea (the oldest life forms on Earth) combined with machine learning &amp; artificial intelligence to create the ‘ultimate’ species for the end of the world as we know it. The project has made in collaboration with researcher/cryomicroscopist Amanda Wilson as part of the EU FET Open H2020 funded MARA project based in the Beeby Lab at Imperial College London, and with Professor Daniel Polani from the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire. The project is supported through an EMAP/EMARE artists’ residency at LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in Spain via funding from Creative Europe and with generous support from Arts Council England.</p>

<p>“BioCompuation Bots” are a brand-new series of artworks made collaboration with Professor Volker Steuber from the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire and artistically respond directly to research projects being undertaken within the university and with international collaborators in order to engage the public and international research community:</p>
<p>Two mouse-like quadruped robots explore research into controlling Petit Mal epilepsy using LEDs embedded in the brain that can ‘reset’ genetically modified cells before a fit occurs. In the research a complex data set was analysed to work out the perfect moment to turn on the fit stopping LED, in the artwork audiences use a blue torch to reset the robot’s ‘brains’ and ‘unfreeze’ them from their virtual fit. Also in collaboration with Dr Freek Hoebeek at Erasmus University in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Another robot on tracked wheels roams around searching for smells that appeal to it and focusses on a kind of perfume designed to appeal to it. Senses such as smell are widely considered to be uniquely related to biological life and closely related to our understanding of consciousness, an assumption that this artwork throws into question. The robot explores artificial nose research being undertaken at the university with Dr Michael Schmucker.</p>

The Swedish Linköping University (LiU) finished their first investigation of the affair of Ashutosh Tiwari and his ongoing predatory conferences. The bureaucrats, busy covering their own professional failures, found that nobody among the grown-up men they investigated was actually responsible for their own behaviour. Not even Tiwari, who would have been LiU professor now where it not for my reporting.

<p>Among the many paradoxes of human nature is this: while many of us spend great time and energy trying to avoid negative emotions, like fear and disgust, there are others who, in an apparent act of emotional masochism, pay good money deliberately seeking out those same unpleasant feelings. Like the visitors to the <em>Basement</em> immersive theatre attraction at the <a href="https://www.scarehouse.com">ScareHouse</a> in Pittsburgh, who spend $31 to “enjoy” being hooded, mildly electrocuted, stabbed (in a simulated fashion), and locked in a coffin, among other delights.</p>
<p>A team of researchers, led by Margee Kerr at the University of Pittsburgh, believe they may have resolved the paradox, although they caution that their findings are exploratory. For their <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51113-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion</em>, they set up a temporary EEG (electroencephalography) lab in a closet in the <em>Basement</em> attraction and found evidence that for many people who willingly submit themselves to an intensely frightening experience, the reward is a boost to their mood and energy, accompanied by a reduction in their neural reactivity. Taken together these effects could be indicative of a beneficial recalibration of their emotions – after you have been scared witless, the mundane travails of life are a breeze.</p>
<p><span id="more-35098"></span></p>
<p>The researchers successfully recruited 262 volunteers who had already purchased tickets to enter the <em>Basement</em> at Pittsburgh’s ScareHouse. They asked them to fill out psychology questionnaires before and after the experience. And for around 80 of them, the researchers also performed successful pre- and post-<em>Basement</em>-visit scans of their brain activity during a range of tasks, including looking at unpleasant pictures, erotic pictures, and ruminating.</p>
<p>Overall, the participants reported being in a more positive emotional state after the horror experience than before – that is, more wonderful and less awful. Those volunteers who were more stressed, tired or bored beforehand showed the greatest emotional benefits, and they tended to rate the horror experience as more intense and thrilling. Another finding was that fewer people reported feeling anxious after the <em>Basement</em> visit than before (challenging the received wisdom that fear breeds anxiety, and supporting the idea that it is anticipation that fuels anxiety, and the resolution of that anticipation fosters relief). Also, fewer people felt tired after the horror experience, indicative of an energising effect.</p>
<p>A major caveat to this research is that it’s based not on the effects any scary experience, but on a deliberately self-inflicted bout of horror – what the researchers call VANE or a Voluntary Arousing Negative Experience.  This seems key because it establishes the context for the fright experience and it’s telling that it was the volunteers who felt happier before their horror visit who were more likely to say afterwards that they felt they’d challenged their fears and learned something about themselves (in turn, people who felt they’d benefited in these ways were also more likely to rate the horror experience as thrilling, intense, uncomfortable, revolting, and scary).</p>
<p>One interpretation of these subjective effects is that they reflect a kind of recalibration of the emotions, which results in feeling better, similar to how we can recalibrate our physical senses. For instance, if your house feels cold, then if you go and stand outside in the snow in shirt-sleeves, your house will feel pleasantly warm when you come back inside. This may be how fun-scary experiences work for some people – after an episode of intense, controlled horror, the return to normal life feels much more pleasant.</p>
<p>This recalibration account appeared to be supported by the readings of the participants’ brain activity, which were dialled down after the horror experience, similar to the documented effects of mindfulness meditation on brain activity. Looking at specific brain wave frequencies, the researchers observed decreased gamma and theta reactivity in volunteers after they had visited the horror <em>Basement</em>, which could suggest “less engaged processing of environmental stressors”, they said.</p>
<p>Also, those volunteers who said they felt wonderful after the horror visit showed less gamma frequencies when asked to ruminate, which “could reflect … perhaps not [being] as compelled by thoughts that previously served to increase their stress”.</p>
<p>Overall, Kerr and her team said that the appeal of intense, voluntary horror experiences is similar to that of thrilling sports: “Within the context of safety and control, guests allow themselves to ‘lean in’ to the fear-inducing experience and reach higher levels of psychological and undefended physiological arousal than in day-to-day experiences.”</p>
<p>Though they said their new findings certainly need replicating (the exploratory nature of the research meant there were many statistical comparisons which increases the risk of apparently meaningful patterns arising by chance), the researchers also suggested they could have some interesting clinical implications.</p>
<p>In the therapeutic context, the closest parallel to voluntarily scaring oneself is exposure therapy, in which the client is gradually exposed to the source of their phobia. The researchers said it could be useful to explore how adding a fun or thrilling framing to exposure therapy might make it a more pleasant and rewarding experience. Conversely, for client groups who are struggling with a lack of emotion and feeling, such as can occur in depression, voluntary scary-fun experiences might offer a way to boost a person’s energy and arousal.</p>
<p>“This study could suggest that inducing high arousal via exposure to negative stimuli may be a substrate for a generation of interventions that do not work to proximally decrease, but rather to increase, arousal in people whose goal is to increase positive affect and feel ‘wonderful’,” the researchers concluded.</p>

<p>Depression is a chronic, recurrent, lifelong condition. Well, that’s the current orthodox view – but it is overstated, argues a team of psychologists led by Jonathan Rottenberg at the University of South Florida. “A significant subset of people recover and thrive after depression, yet research on such individuals has been rare,” they write in their <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618769868">recent paper</a> in <i>Perspectives on Psychological Science</i>. They propose a definition for “high functioning after depression” (HFAD); argue that the advice given to people with depression need not be so gloomy; and lay out key areas for future research.</p>
<p><span id="more-35086"></span></p>
<p>The “gloomy” view of depression is relatively recent, the researchers argue. Just a generation or two ago, conventional wisdom held that depression was the opposite – transient and self-limiting. “But what if neither the older orthodoxy nor the new view of depression fully captures the truth?”, Rottenberg and his colleagues ask. “What if, instead, two variants of depression operate simultaneously – a grim chronically-recurring, lifelong variant, and a relatively benign, time-limited variant?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Long-term studies certainly suggest that a substantial population of people are affected by a burdensome, recurrent form of the disorder. But Rottenberg’s team cite three studies finding that an average of 40 to 50 per cent of people who suffer an episode of depression don’t go on to experience another (for example, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/div-classtitlethe-long-term-course-of-depressive-disorders-in-the-lundby-studydiv/0E61F1332D07D51C31B92CA5B4EAB6BA">this study</a> in Sweden) – but overall these individuals have been little studied. “This omission, and the field’s lack of focus on good outcomes after depression more broadly, virtually guarantees an unduly pessimistic impression of depression’s course”, Rottenberg and co write – and this is an impression they would like to see changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>HFAD has been overlooked in part, they argue, because researchers, influenced by the current view, have focused on finding factors associated with chronicity and recurrence. Also, people with recurrent depression are highly likely to be over-represented in depression studies simply because, when researchers put a call out for subjects with depression, these people are statistically more likely to be suffering at the time, and so to be recruited.</p>
<p>To be categorised as experiencing HFAD requires more than simply remitting or recovering from the symptoms of major depression for at least a year, Rottenberg and his colleagues add. An individual must also have achieved “high end-state functioning” – doing well at work and home and socially, and reporting “robust” wellbeing – feeling satisfied with life and enjoying high levels of self-acceptance, for instance.</p>
<p>With such powers of recovery, what leads people who exhibit HFAD to become depressed in the first place? “One hypothesis might be that HFAD represents a more psychosocial form of depression that is more likely to be precipitated by environmental adversity, such as death, a break up of a romantic relationship or a job loss,” the team suggest.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is the case clearly needs exploring. And they point to other big questions. For instance: Are people who are HFAD more likely to have sought help while they were depressed? Does depression itself play a role in triggering  the long-term improvement seen in HFAD? (Something similar has been proposed <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/22/for-some-experiencing-trauma-may-act-as-a-form-of-cognitive-training-that-increases-their-mental-control/">for trauma</a>). Can we apply what is learnt about HFAD to enhance clinical interventions?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What does HFAD tell us about thriving after other mental disorders?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are clearly a lot of questions. But here, at least, is a framework for finding potentially useful answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“One reason HFAD needs to be discussed,” the researchers write, “is that it is part of the truth, which patients and the broader public are owed. It would be odd if an oncologist did not tell a cancer patient his or her chances of achieving lifetime remission. We submit that a depressed patient also deserves to know. The public deserves to know as well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Certis’ Orthotopic Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) provides a cost-effective model for developing new drugs to battle all types of cancers. Using the orthotopic technique, Certis <span style="font-size: 1rem;">scientists take a very small specimen of the human patient’s tumor and surgically implant it into the corresponding anatomic location (pancreas, liver, lung, etc.) in immunodeficient mice. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies contract with </span>Certis to develop custom mouse models to test against all types of solid tumors to determine the effectiveness of new drugs they are developing.</p>
<p>“Our primary objective is to save and extend lives,” said Peter Ellman, CEO at Certis Oncology. “To help us achieve this goal, Science Exchange is providing us with the reach and support to expedite the availability of our pre-clinical and tumor banking services to companies around the world that are developing new cancer drugs.”</p>
<p>“Certis’s Orthotopic PDX technique has proven to rapidly grow individual patient tumors in mice at a high rate,” said Elizabeth Iorns , Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “The orthotopic models more accurately replicate human tumor growth, metastasis and response to therapy, making it more immediately clinically relevant than other models. Success with drug testing on these mice can help determine which drugs are suitable for human clinical trials.”</p>

<p>Let’s start with a quick multiple-choice test about multiple-choice tests: when designing them, should you a) avoid using complex questions, b) have lots of potential answers for each question, c) all of the above or d) none of the above? The correct answer is (a), though as we’ll see, this was not a very well-crafted multiple-choice question.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The issue of how best to design multiple-choice questions is important since they have been popular in both education and business settings for many years now. This is due to them being quick to administer and easy to mark and grade. Furthermore, many students often report preferring them over other test formats.</p>
<p>As well as being a useful assessment tool, if they are well-designed they can also aid learning. This is because of the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/29/episode-13-how-to-study-and-learn-more-effectively/">Testing Effect</a> – the way that retrieving knowledge helps consolidate it in memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Thankfully in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368118301426">recent paper</a> in <i>Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition</i> Andrew Butler of Washington University in St. Louis has reviewed the parallel literatures on how best to design multiple-choice tests for learning and assessment, and from this he’s recommended six evidence-based tips: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35078"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using complex questions or answer formats. When things are too complex, it leads to misunderstandings and students guessing the answer. By keeping the format simple, it makes it a more reliable assessment of what the students do or don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Create questions that focus on specific parts of knowledge or thought processes that you want to assess. For example, questions could focus on retrieval of a specific fact, contrasting two concepts, or applying a theory to a new situation.</li>
<li>Avoid using “None of the Above” and/or “All of the above” as potential answers. The main issue with “None of the Above” is that if it is the correct answer, then the test-taker has been exposed to numerous false answers. This therefore represents a missed opportunity to reinforce what the correct answer was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> “</span>All of the Above” may be helpful when it is the correct answer because, as Butler explains, “the test taker is only exposed to the correct information”, but may do more harm than good if it is the incorrect answer because of exposure to false answers.</li>
<li>Be economical with the number of answer options. The topic will have a bearing on the optimal number to offer, but three potential answers usually provides enough difficulty whilst also being time efficient. Excessive potential answers may be problematic if the main aim is to enhance learning, as it will “expose test takers to a lot of incorrect information, [which] is worrisome because they could potentially learn it”.</li>
<li>Ensure the answer choice is “moderately difficult”. If it is too easy or too hard then little will be learnt. Butler states that “the ideal difficulty level is a bit higher than the midpoint between chance and perfect performance”.</li>
<li>Ensure you provide feedback on the correct answers. When giving feedback to students, Butler notes that “one important caveat is that the effectiveness of feedback depends upon students being motivated to process it and their motivation tends to decrease over time”. Therefore, if feedback is delayed, it would be wise to take steps to ensure that students are “required or incentivized to process it”.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper has useful implications for anyone designing multiple-choice tests. Butler notes that more research is still needed, however. For example, one area that shows promise is having students assign a confidence rating to their answer, as this helps measure partial knowledge. However, the exact format for doing this is still being studied.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Grumpy-Cat-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Inter-species companionship, such as keeping pets, is an ancient practice for humans indicating a significant value obtained from the relationship. Historically, humans demonstrated this value by sharing resources such as food and shelter with their animal companions. Today, value is reflected monetarily. One worldwide 2017 study estimate suggested that <a href="https://globalpets.community/article/global-pet-industry-facts-and-figures">humans spent $109 billion on pet care goods</a> and services. Although we can track the economic value of our animal companions, how people mentally conceptualize their animal companions remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>To better understand how we conceptualize popular pets such as cats and dogs, Hoffman and colleagues’ <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0228-1?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Psychology-Behavior-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_OCT2018_National_Cat_Day">recent article</a> in <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a> reports findings from a survey aimed at determining how we conceptualize these animal companions.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-10629 aligncenter" height="265" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Cat-and-dog-300x176.jpeg" width="452" />
<p>Hoffman and colleagues’ online survey, utilized open ended questions with a free-elicitation methodology to capture respondents’ most salient concepts (i.e. characteristics and emotions) when asked what they think about cats and dogs. The free-elicitation method allows respondents to answer with any words or phrases that come to mind when asked the open-ended question: “Which aspects come to mind when you think of cats?”.</p>
<p>Researchers regarded the most salient concepts to be the ones most frequently associated with the overall conceptualization of the animals and therefore more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>This pattern differed in cats in that independent of ownership or planned ownership the highest reported attributes only included “personality” and “love”.</p></blockquote>
<p>The multitude of unique responses were then categorized for analysis. Synonymous words (e.g. “friendly”, “kind”, and “warm-hearted”) used in responses were grouped together. Groups of words with similar conceptual meaning were further categorized. For example, “stubborn”, “proud,” and “integrity” were grouped under the personality/mentality category. Respondents were also grouped depending on whether they owned pets, and if they did not, whether they were thinking about owning.</p>
<p>When conceptualizing dogs, respondents – independent of ownership or planned ownership – all responded with the same top attributes, namely: “friendship”, “love”, “companionship”, “joy”, and “loyalty.” This pattern differed in cats in that independent of ownership or planned ownership the highest reported attributes only included “personality” and “love”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, individuals who did not plan on owning a dog or cat ranked the attribute of “nuisance” higher than owners and potential owners.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10632 alignleft" height="265" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/cat-in-box-300x265.jpg" width="300" />
<p>The results of this research not only demonstrate that people conceptualize cats and dogs in different ways, but that our conceptualizations can transcend the type of relationship a person has with a pet. People associate dogs with attributes related to “friendship”, love”, “companionship”, “joy”, and “loyalty” while they associate cats with attributes related to “personality” and “love”.</p>
<p>The ways in which people conceptualize cats is particularly interesting. The top two attributes of “love” and “personality” were at least 30% more likely to be considered important than the attribute ranked third (companionship). Furthermore, “social interaction” was one of the least important attributes. These findings reflect a seemingly conflicting view of the relationship between cats and humans in that concepts of love can be independent of concepts such as companionship and social interaction.</p>
<p>The one top value that both cats and dogs shared was “love”. Perhaps this is the greatest rationalization for the exorbitant value we place on our two most popular animal companions. The economic expenses we devote to them seems to be justified by the reciprocated emotional value obtained from these companion animals.</p>
<p>So, for this year’s National Cat Day think about the ancient Egyptians, Japanese culture, and the entire world’s obsession with cat videos. Cats have been adored and viewed sacred for centuries and they have provided us with the most valuable gifts of all: love.</p>

Much of French media and academia, and certainly also the international plant science community now debates a hot conspiracy theory: what if Olivier Voinnet is actually innocent, a visionary genius who fell prey to a conspiracy of fraudulent colleagues and scheming bureaucrats? I discuss here the widespread dishonesty and data manipulation among Voinnet's co-authors and peers. Is French research culture to blame?

<p>In a <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00310.2018">2018 study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Applied Physiology</em>, researchers at Liverpool John Moores University in England claim sitting for too long reduces blood flow to the brain.</p>
<h2>The Brain Needs Blood Flow</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to overemphasise the importance of maintaining blood flow to the brain. The brain needs adequate oxygen to function, and limiting this oxygen supply can be fatal. Indeed, when blood flow in the brain occurs even in a limited area, the result can be a fatal stroke.</p>
<p>But does sitting too long in one position, as many office workers do, really slow blood flow to the brain? After all, our hearts still beat even when we’re sitting, right?</p>
<p>The research study focused on 15 individuals who already had a desk job. They travelled to the research lab at John Moores on three separate occasions. On one occasion, they were to sit at their desks for four hours, getting up only to go to the loo when necessary. On the second visit, participants were directed to get up every half hour and walk on a treadmill for two minutes. On the last, they were instructed to sit at the desk for two hours, then walk for eight minutes.</p>
<p>The participants’ brain blood flow was measured using specialised headbands containing ultrasound probes that track blood flow through their middle cerebral arteries, one of the main vessels supplying blood to the brain.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, blood flow dropped after the participants were sedentary for four hours. However, when participants stood up and walked about blood flow to the brain returned to normal.</p>
<h2>Two Minute Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the study found a two-minute walk every half hour, was <em>more effective</em> than taking an eight-minute walk every two hours.</p>
<p>This simple finding highlights the importance of incorporating regular mini-breaks into our regular office routine to keep our blood flowing.</p>
<p>This study should serve as a wakeup call to anyone who manages people in an office setting – getting you and your employees up and moving can bring about a productivity boost.</p>
<p>For once, there seems to be a ‘quick fix’!</p>
<p>Simply setting some sort of alarm on their phone or computer to go off every 30 minutes or using an app as a reminder to get up and moving regularly can make employees both happier and more productive.</p>
<h2>Moving Benefits More Than Just Your Brain</h2>
<p>In addition to increasing clear and productivity, we have <a href="https://yourbrainmatters.org.au/brain_health/evidence/physical_activity">ample evidence</a> that moving more may help to ward off the onset of brain disease such as Alzheimer’s disease. While diseases such as Alzheimer’s remain too complex to point to any one specific preventative remedy, it makes sense to do as much as possible to try to avoid the disease.</p>
<p>In addition, getting up and moving regularly helps to immediately mitigate the impact of certain neuromuscular diseases such as arthritis and fibromyalgia. We’re all familiar with the stiff neck that comes with staring at a computer monitor for too long. Taking regular mini walking breaks <a href="https://spineina.com/2017/12/20/conditions-that-cause-neck-pain/">helps ward off stiffness and fatigue</a>, and is a bonus for eye health as well.</p>
<p>Finding ways to move more now can make for a happier and more satisfying life well into our golden years.</p>
<p>So, if you want to improve your productivity and protect your brain health, step away from your desk!</p>

<p>One of the outstanding mysteries of the cerebral cortex is how individual neurons develop the proper synaptic connections to form large-scale, distributed networks. Now, an international team of scientists have gained novel insights from studying spontaneously generated patterns of activity arising from local connections in the early developing visual cortex. These early activity patterns serve as a template for the subsequent development of the long-range neural connections that are a defining feature of mature distributed networks.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0247-5">recently published <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> article</a>, scientists at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Goethe University of Frankfurt, and the University of Minnesota detail how they investigated the visual cortex of the ferret, an ideal model system to explore the early development of networks in the cortex. These are composed of thousands of neurons and are distributed over millimeters of the cortical surface. In the visual cortex, network activity encodes specific features of the visual scene like the orientation of edges and the direction of object motion.</p>
<p>By using calcium imaging techniques, the scientists were able to visualize with unprecedented resolution spontaneous neural activity patterns, i.e. activity patterns that occurred in the absence of visual stimulation. To their great surprise, the spontaneous activity patterns in mature animals were highly correlated between distant populations of neurons – and in fact were so highly correlated that the activity of small populations of neurons could reliably predict coincident network activity patterns millimeters away, and these correlation patterns beautifully predicted the patterns of network activity evoked by visual stimulation.</p>
<p>In their next step, the researchers used this remarkable correspondence of spontaneous and visually-evoked network patterns to find out how these networks developed in the immature brain. By looking at the state of spontaneous activity patterns prior to eye opening, they expected to see a striking difference in the patterns of spontaneous activity because the long-range cortical connections that are thought to be the basis for distributed network activity patterns are absent in the immature cortex. To their surprise, they discovered robust long-range patterns of correlated spontaneous activity prior to eye opening, and found that they extended over distances comparable to what was seen in the mature brain.</p>
<p>Confronted with this paradox, the researchers first considered whether the correlated activity patterns could be spreading through chains of local cortical connections, similar to a forest fire. To test this intriguing possibility, scientists built a computational model of the neural circuitry in the early visual cortex. They found that by using a set of parameters that are consistent with the organization of local cortical connections, the model could precisely reproduce the patterns of spontaneous long-range correlations they had observed experimentally, without the need for long-range connections.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that long-range order in the early developing cortex originates from neural activity driven by short-range connections. In other words, local connections build a network activity scaffold. Following the well-accepted plasticity rule ‘what fires together wires together’, activity mediated by local connections can then guide the subsequent formation of long-range network connections. In a twist of the oft-used phrase, ‘think globally, act locally’, developing cortical circuits act locally to achieve global effects. Future studies will test the prediction that activity dependent plasticity mechanisms shape the structure of long-range connections based on the instructive activity patterns derived from local cortical connections.</p>

<h4>His autobiography will make you laugh, cry, and appreciate the underdogs of the brain</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x03almlrQv4UPSfqV4OFMw.jpeg" />Ben Barres’ autobiography, rabbit for scale. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>There are very few stories like Ben Barres’. There could be more out there, but as it goes, sometimes you need to hear someone else’s story before you can recognize your own.</p><p>It wasn’t until Ben Barres read a local news release written by a trans man that he had ever heard the term “transgender.” At the time, Ben was 43 years old and a tenured neuroscience professor at Stanford. The story was a memoir of sorts, written by a San Francisco trans person and activist, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jamison+green">Jamison Green</a>. It was that four page article that inspired Ben to address a long held discomfort with his body and find a therapist to explore the idea that he too might be transgender.</p><p>Last year, many of us mourned <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/12/neuroscientist-ben-barres-dies-at-63.html">Ben’s passing</a>. Fortunately for the next generation of LGBT folk, he captured his experiences as a trans person in his posthumous memoir, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/autobiography-transgender-scientist"><em>The Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist</em></a>. I suspect that many scientists — LGBT and otherwise — will find his candid depiction of both his own life and scientific journey to be wholly inspiring.</p><p>The candor begins in the memoir’s foreword by Nancy Hopkins, who presents several emails written by Ben to various esteemed members of the scientific community, including NIH Director Francis Collins. Ben was, to put it lightly, livid about the state of gender equality in many scientific institutions. He fought tirelessly for policies to protect women from sexual harassment and refused invitations to institutions with extremely poor gender ratios. “You have a hell of a lot of nerve inviting me after sending that speaker list,” Ben wrote to one (undisclosed) institution.</p><p>In his recollection of his life and scientific trajectory, Ben doesn’t hold anything back. It is a story of many remarkable scientific achievements punctuated by intensely difficult moments, when Ben considered ending his academic career or even worse, his life.</p><p>Thankfully for the cellular underdogs of the brain, glial cells, Ben had incredible mentors and a supportive community. He came out to his friends and family in an email:</p><blockquote>“I’m still going to wear jeans and tee shirts and pretty much be the same person I always have been — it’s just that I’m going to be a lot happier.”</blockquote><p>Chuck Stevens, a scientist at the Salk Institute and a mentor to Ben replied,</p><blockquote>“I have always been fond of the person in there and the gender makes no difference to me — I expect you will find the same with all of your friends. Let me know when to change to ‘Ben.’”</blockquote><p>A few days ago, I ran into Chuck at a UCSD coffee cart and pulled Ben’s autobiography out of my bag to show him the passage. He smiled, “Ben was a wonderful human.” He recounted their exchange to me around his coming out, and shared some other similarly supportive and jovial remarks from other colleagues. One organizer of a Gordon conference apparently joked with Ben that he had thrown off the intended gender ratio — a prescient comment, indeed.</p><p>Much of the memoir is devoted to Ben’s scientific endeavors, and rightfully so. Ben thoughtfully guides the reader through the series of experiments conducted by his trainees. He writes with the precision of a practiced biologist, someone who has spent most of his life thinking about minuscule interactions between tiny molecules and brain cells. There is little conjecture but many thoughtful questions — some answered, some left for future scientists to tackle.</p><p>But when Ben writes about advocacy for gender equality and for more clinically-oriented research training, the passion is palpable. These passages read very differently from the descriptions of his science — they are urgent calls to action that stem from a life lived in the shadow of inequality. Ben has eloquently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/442133a">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5La-ZPjJdM">spoken</a> about gender inequality, but his passages in this book (as well as the example emails in the foreword) are bare, first-hand evidence of Ben’s fury. He lived a very difficult life — he does not want others to have to endure what he endured.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uF_Q5JB69oq9H1XHRKSdVQ.png" />[Image description: Sketch of Ben Barres with the transgender pride flag &amp; astrocytes, by the author]</figure><p>As I suspect many others will feel, I recognized parts of my own story in Ben’s writing. On a plane ride back to San Diego, one passage caught my teary eyes:</p><blockquote>“Many LGBT people in my generation share growing up with a shameful secret and consequent low self-esteem. Perhaps this may drive us to work hard to succeed in order to prove our self-worth.”</blockquote><p>Wow, does this hit home. I grew up in a staunchly Catholic family, and I remember explicitly telling myself that I <em>must </em>do well in school and extracurriculars to make up for my major flaw — being gay. I had to demonstrate my worth through good grades, and hoped that in the end this would outweigh my sinfulness.</p><p>Throughout his memoir, Ben candidly recounts many feelings that will undoubtedly resonate with many in the LGBT community and beyond. His honesty and openness will not go unnoticed.</p><p><em>The Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist</em> can be purchased on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Transgender-Scientist-MIT-Press/dp/0262039117/">Amazon</a> or through <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/autobiography-transgender-scientist">MIT Books</a>.</p><p>If you’d like to learn about LGBT scientists, check out <a href="https://www.500queerscientists.com/">500 Queer Scientists</a>.</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/grimalkina">Catherine Hicks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mspowahs">Ada Powers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ekaleedmiston">Kale Edmiston</a> for their input on this piece.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=57accdd6a476" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/ben-barres-tells-his-story-in-his-own-words-57accdd6a476">Ben Barres tells his story in his own words</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
