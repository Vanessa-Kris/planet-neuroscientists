<p>Loneliness <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">is a “disease”</a>, associated with an increased risk of death equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Strides have been made in understanding what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/">form of loneliness</a> is damaging<i> </i>(a lack of<i> close</i> relationships with other people, rather than a lack of relationships per se), but ways to tackle loneliness are badly needed. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/">new study</a>, available as a preprint on PsyArXiv, reveals a way in which loneliness seems to be maintained and, therefore, a potential route to an intervention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37348"></span></p>
<p>A popular model of loneliness holds that it is maintained by abnormal processing of the social signals – such as smiles and eye contact – that underlie positive social interactions. One consequence of this abnormal processing could be a failure to automatically mimic other people’s facial expressions – a phenomenon that occurs naturally during most social interactions. To investigate for the first time whether this is the case, Andrew Arnold and Piotr Winkielman at the University of California, San Diego conducted a small, preliminary study on 35 student volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students first completed three scales that measured their loneliness, depression and personality. Based on the loneliness results, they were classed as either lonely or not lonely. Next they had electrodes attached to two pairs of their own facial muscles important for generating emotional expressions – regions of the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles in the cheeks, and also the corrugator supercilii (frowning) muscles in the brow. They were then shown video clips of men and women making facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scales that they were given to complete showed that the lonely and non-lonely students were equally good at distinguishing between facial expressions, and there were no group differences in the strength of “negative emotion” ratings to anger, fear and sadness or “positive” ratings to joy. So the lonely people could recognise and understand emotional expressions just as well as the non-lonely group. However, there were important differences in how their <i>own</i> faces responded spontaneously to the video clips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When members of both groups saw videos of people displaying anger, for example, their own brows moved to automatically mimic this expression. But when the expression in the video was of joy, only the “non-lonely” group automatically smiled in response. The participants’ scores on depression and on extraversion bore no relation to this finding. It was loneliness that made the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers checked that the lonely group could deliberately mimic smiles, as well as frowns (which they could). They also found that the lonely group smiled automatically while viewing “non-social” positive images (such as nature scenes) that also made the other group smile. These images didn’t include people (or if they did, their facial expressions weren’t obvious.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that a failure to mimic other people’s smiles automatically could be playing a role in loneliness. A failure to mimic a smile might send an antisocial signal to others, the researchers note, undermining social connections, and leading to social <i>dis</i>connect. “Indeed, this could be one behavioural mechanism that maintains chronic loneliness,” they add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is a small study, and it can’t speak to the causal direction: does loneliness lead to a problem with smile mimicry or is it the other way around? But it does suggest a new target for addressing loneliness, and for further research into the role it might potentially play in real-world encounters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Given the serious problem of loneliness in society and its danger to health, more research on how it presents in everyday social interactions is useful for greater understanding of and treatment of the condition, ourselves and each other,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life <em>in </em>those years?</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?</h2>
<p>“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.</p>
<p>The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367"><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.</p>
<p>“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.</p>
<p>As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.</p>
<h2>The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease</h2>
<p>Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another longevity project, the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.</p>
<p>Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.</p>
<h2>Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.</h2>
<p>Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live <em>with</em> illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.</p>
<p>It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.</p>
<p>Regardless of their age, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289">research</a> indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?</h2>
<p>In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.</p>
<p>Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p>The older you get the happier you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159"><em>The emotion paradox in the aging brain</em></a>, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.</p>
<blockquote><p>When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.</p>

<p>These days, we are exposed to a number of sources of fluoride, including water (naturally occurring or added artificially), food that has been exposed to fluoride (particularly through the use of pesticides) and dental products (toothpaste, mouthwash etc). High levels of fluoride exposure can lead to a number of health problems, for example, skin conditions, such as acne; heart problems; high blood pressure and osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The degree of fluoride exposure can be measured using biomarkers, substances that can be used to examine changes in the body that may lead to health conditions or disease.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11089 alignleft" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/feet-2429438_1920-300x225.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Here, Elekdag-Turk et al, have used toenail and hair samples as biomarkers for fluoride exposure. Toenails and hair are considered to be particularly suitable as they are collected in a non-invasive way and the concentration of the fluoride is believed to represent the average level of fluoride intake and concentration of the trace element on the blood over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Samples from big toenails and hair were taken from participants living in a region with a high concentration of fluoride in drinking water (endemic fluorosis region) and participants living in a region where there Is a low level of fluoride in the drinking water (non-endemic fluorosis region).</p>
<p>Results showed that the mean fluoride concentrations found in both biomarkers were significantly higher in the endemic fluorosis region compared to the endemic fluorosis region. The fluoride assay for big toenails were found to be more accurate than that for hair, leading the authors to conclude that both nail and hair samples can serve as biomarkers for fluoride exposure but bog toenails are better.</p>

<p>The question of whether someone should be assisted in committing suicide due to existential suffering has been brought into sharp relief by the case of Noa Pothoven, who after a number of years suffering mental illness, ended her own life after a request for assisted suicide at a clinic in the Netherlands had been refused. In Switzerland, people can be granted access to assisted suicide as long as they perform the act themselves, are able to make their own decision and they do not have a selfish motivation for doing so.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Switzerland, people can be granted access to assisted suicide as long as they perform the act themselves, are able to make their own decision and they do not have a selfish motivation for doing so.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, existential suffering as a reason for assisted suicide is seen as somewhat controversial, difficult to define and, as yet, there is no consensus on how evaluate and manage it.</p>
<p>Gaignard and Hurt have recently published an article in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> on how care professionals and volunteers from a “right-to-die organization” think about existential suffering being used as a reason for assisted suicide requests. They conducted face-to-face interviews with 26 care professionals. The participants described existential suffering in a number of different ways, sharing stories on physical decline, loneliness, loss of hope and fears of being a financial burden. A common topic was how older and vulnerable people are perceived in society.</p>
<p>Interestingly, only four of the 63 stories discussed referred to a “pure” existential suffering, where the sufferer just felt that life had naturally come to an end. Gaignard and Hurt concluded that a better understanding of existential suffering is needed so to provide a “toolbox” to others so that they can better help those in existential suffering.</p>

<p>Electronic (e) cigarettes are generally perceived to be better for you than conventional cigarettes and have been used by many as a tool when trying to give up smoking. However, there have been a number of cases of nicotine intoxication, a few with fatal consequences.</p>
<p><em>BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology</em> reports a case study describing a near fatal intoxication of an e-liquid including follow-up of the patient once they had recovered.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11090 alignleft" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/steam-668449_1920-300x201.jpg" width="300" />
<p>The patient in question was a 51 year old man who was admitted to the Emergency Department after injecting himself intravenously with e-liquid in a suicide attempt. He was initially very agitated but then fell into a coma, after which he needed mechanical ventilation. The patient then went on to show neurological symptoms, including tetraparesis (muscle weakness) and Myoclonus (involuntary muscle twitches) due to nicotinic syndrome, a condition that develops when the nicotinic receptors in the brain are over-stimulated.</p>
<p>Seven hours after he had injected himself with the e-liquid, the patient began to recover, being able to breath on his own again and gradually regaining consciousness. The patient was subsequently discharged after a psychiatric evaluation and was followed up at an out-patient clinic.</p>
<p>The take home message from this case study is that even a small amount of intravenous e-liquid can lead to acute intoxication and death due to the toxic effects of nicotine. It is hoped that this case may help emergency doctors treat similar cases in the future.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>There are many reasons why media outlets report scientifically misleading information. But one key site at which this sort of misunderstanding takes root is in the press releases that universities issue when one of their researchers has published something that has a chance of garnering some attention. A <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1324-7">new open-access study in BMC Medicine</a> attempts to change this by intervening in the process directly.</p>
<p><span id="more-37345"></span></p>
<p>Press releases are often misleading in many different ways, but a common flaw is their <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/21/how-much-are-readers-misled-by-headlines-that-imply-correlational-findings-are-causal/">tendency to confuse causal and correlational claims</a>. That is, an observational study will find that (to take a hypothetical), the more wine people drink, the more likely they are to be diagnosed with cancer over a given period. A study like this, reported accurately, doesn’t show that drinking wine <i>causes</i> cancer – it shows that wine consumption is <i>associated with </i>cancer diagnoses. It could be some other factor or factors is/are responsible for the link, like maybe people who drink more wine engage in other behaviours that <i>themselves</i> increase the risk of cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Experimental studies, on the other hand, allow for the more confident drawing of causal inferences. If (again hypothetically) you took two otherwise equivalent groups, assigned one to make no lifestyle changes other than beginning to drink more wine, and then tracked differences in long-term cancer diagnoses, it’s more likely any observed group differences were caused by the experimental intervention.</p>
<p>The way that health press releases often present purely correlational evidence as though it is causal is, to an extent, understandable: “Wine Causes Cancer” is more eye-catching than “Researchers Uncover A Correlation Between Wine Consumption And Cancer That May Or May Not Be Causal.” And because journalists often write stories based entirely on press releases, the end result is that news coverage often lacks nuance.</p>
<p>For the new research, a team of psychologists led by Rachel Adams at Cardiff University and including her colleague Christopher Chambers, the author of “The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology: A Manifesto for Reforming the Culture of Scientific Practice”, asked a bunch of university press offices to participate. The press offices sent the team hundreds of their biomedical and health-related press releases before they went out to the public, and Chambers and his colleagues randomly assigned them to different conditions: some they didn’t touch regardless of their contents or accuracy (the control group), whereas for the others they proposed edits that “aligned” the press release’s headline and content with the nature of the evidence (with experimental evidence allowing for stronger causal claims, and purely correlational evidence presented with cautious language). Then they watched the press releases go into the wild, evaluating how often their more careful approach was carried over into any ensuing national and international press stories – and whether the toned down releases led to less media coverage.</p>
<p>The most important takeaways are that news headlines were more accurate when they were written off more accurate press releases (which shows that journalists really are relying heavily on press releases rather than reading the studies themselves). And as judged by the amount of media coverage each press release generated, there was “no evidence of reduced news uptake for press releases whose headlines and main claims aligned to evidence.” Now, press releases should be accurate for accuracy’s own sake, but this does offer some evidence that honest press-release writers won’t be punished, in terms of reduced media coverage, by doing the right thing. This suggests, as Chambers and his team write in their abstract, that “[c]autious claims and explicit caveats about correlational findings may penetrate into news without harming news interest.”</p>
<p>As the research team further point out, what this study can’t answer is the actual effect of misleading versus appropriately hedged media coverage on news consumers themselves – that is, will their behaviour change on the basis of whether or not they are reading accurate health coverage? That’s a question for future research.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating and important to conduct a study like this on press releases related to psychological findings – another area where it’s been fairly standard <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/08/tetris-related-science-reporting-failure.html">for a while</a> for weak or conflicting findings to be presented in a much stronger, more attention-getting manner in press releases, potentially causing harm to readers.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<h2>When does old age begin?</h2>
<p>We can’t seem to make up our minds, and the older we get, the further we move the goalposts marking the last season of our lives.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/06/29/growing-old-in-america-expectations-vs-reality/">2009 survey</a> of Americans asked participants when they believed someone grew ‘old’.</p>
<p>Young folks in their twenties believed said old age began at 60. Those under 50 put the threshold closer to 70, whereas those 65 and above said that the average person does not become old until turning 74.</p>
<p>Getting old wasn’t nearly as bad as people think it will be. Nor was it quite as good.</p>
<p>On the downside, one in four adults ages 65 surveyed reported memory loss. One in five had a serious illness, are no longer sexually active, or often feel sad or depressed, lonely or have trouble paying bills. One in ten felt like a burden.</p>
<p>On the upside, the same group said they have more time for hobbies, travel, volunteer work, and more financial security. Of all the good things about getting old, the best by far, according to older adults, is being able to spend more time with family members.</p>
<h2>“Am I Old? Certainly not!”</h2>
<p>One of my boys said to me recently he couldn’t imagine me as a little girl and how did it feel to finally be “old”. I told him I feel the same now as I did when I was 10.</p>
<p>“Am I Old? Certainly not!” This was the answer survey respondents gave too.</p>
<p>In fact, the older they got, the younger they said they feel. About half of those under 30 said they felt their age. But those who were 75 and older? Just 35% say they feel “old”.</p>
<p>It seems we remain on intimate terms with our much younger selves — I sometimes wonder how ten-year old me suddenly became forty-three?</p>
<h2>We enter the end of our lifespan with our past woven intimately into our biology.</h2>
<p>From birth, our neural architecture is shaped by life’s ups and downs, the decisions we made, the places where we lived, worked and learned, the meaning we’ve derived, and who we loved, gave life to, and travelled with through time. How we spend our early years will determine how we age.</p>
<p>More and more of us are living to into old age, and there has never been a better time in which to do so. Our large clever human brains have bequeathed us with modern medicine and tools with which we manage our reproductive health, avoid maternal and neonatal death, vaccinate against disease, prevent pain, treat infection and some cancers, and perform surgery if required.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, women lived barely long enough to see out their 50s. A baby girl born today can expect to live to see out the first decades of the 22<sup>nd</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the secrets of exceptional longevity</h2>
<p>On February 21, 1875, one year before the Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, cinema, and on a trip to Paris saw the Eiffel tower being built. When she was 13, Jeanne met Vincent Van Gogh; although apparently, she was less than impressed saying he was ”…very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick…”.</p>
<p>In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf, and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and “alert as a hummingbird” till the end. The French called her “la doyenne de l’humanitè” (the elder of humankind) and she still holds <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11520-2_16">the record</a> for the world’s longest ever living human (although this has been recently <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/">challenged</a>).</p>
<p>In April 2017, the latest longevity record holder, Emma Martina Luigia Morano of Vercelli, Italy, died aged 117. Born in November 1899, Morano was the last known living person who was born in the 1800s. According to the Guinness Book of Records, Morano followed the same extraordinary diet for around 90 years: three eggs per day (two raw, one cooked), fresh Italian pasta, and a dish of raw meat. The current longevity crown belongs to Polish Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal, who celebrated his 113th birthday in September 2017.</p>
<h2>Once rare as diamonds, the oldest of the old are the fastest growing sector of our global population.</h2>
<p>If you were born in 1900, the odds of living till age 100 were less than 1 in a million, and few people lived long enough see out the 1950s. For girls born into wealthy countries today, the odds of blowing out 100 candles on a cake are roughly 1 in 50.</p>
<p>Israel Kristal claims he doesn’t know the secret of his long life.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that everything is determined from above and we shall never know the reasons why. There have been smarter, stronger and better-looking men then me who are no longer alive. All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked her secrets, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that … I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes. Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hard work, raw eggs, biking, and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wait. For death and journalists.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Blue Zones lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>In another longevity project, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner together Professor Michel Poulain famously described five ‘<a href="https://www.bluezones.com/">Blue Zones</a>’ around the globe where the residents live to exceptional old age. Despite being very different parts of the world, there are commonalities to the resident’s lifestyles.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their longevity has nothing to do with brute discipline, diets, exercise programs or supplements… In Blue Zones areas around the world, longevity happens to people. It’s the result of the right environment that constantly nudges them into moving more, eating more plants and beans while eating less meat and sugar, socializing with the right people and living out their values. It’s that simple, really.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Residents of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, prioritise friendship and family, and they almost never work extra hours if it means they have to forego a good party. They also foster ‘plan de vida’ or ‘a reason to live’.</li>
<li>In Loma Linda, California, the strong sense of purpose, day of rest, no-smoking policy, and healthy diet practices of the local Seventh Day Adventist community has rubbed off on the health of the whole town.</li>
<li>Residents of the mountainous villages of Sardinia, Italy and the Greek island of Ikaria, nap, fast, grow their own food, and drink wine daily with friends. It’s thought the clean air, warm breezes and rugged terrain of the Mediterranean islands draw locals outdoors to move naturally.</li>
<li>The residents of the Japanese islands of Okinawa, home to the world’s longest living women, are dedicated to family. Okinawans practice ‘Hara hachi bu’, a reminder to stop eating when they’re 80% full, ‘Ikigai’, which roughly translates to “Why I wake up in the morning,” and form ‘Moais’, groups of five friends that remain committed to each other for live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buettner has distilled the lifestyle practices of Blue Zones into lessons for longevity. As he says, to make it to 100 you may have to “win the genetic lottery”, but the average person’s life expectancy can be increased by moving move, prioritising friends, family and social gatherings, eating less, drinking wine, and fostering a sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Sydney Centenarian Study lessons for longevity</h2>
<p>Due to the rarity of extremely old folks, the <a href="https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/research-projects/sydney-centenarian-study">Sydney Centenarian Study</a> has partnered with a consortium of centenarian research teams from around the globe to pool their resources and data to enable more powerful conclusions to be drawn. Their data support the Blue Zones observations.</p>
<p>Charlene Levitan, who once headed up the Sydney Centenarian Study says,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is emerging from the global research is that around 30% of longevity is contributed by genetics. The remaining 70% is to do with our lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, exercise, and remaining socially integrated.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest themes to emerge is related to the personality traits of resilience, adaptability and optimism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of our centenarians will report optimism as a life-long personality characteristic.</p></blockquote>

All you see is a shell with no being inside, a mask covering nothingness. I am no one and no thing. I am the unborn, the non-existent.’</i><br /><br />– from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10943-019-00794-x" target="_blank">Pickering (2019)</a>. </blockquote><br /><a href="https://www.therapytribe.com/listing/dr-judith-pickering-marriage-and-family-therapist-camperdown-new-south-wales-australia-2050/" target="_blank">Dr. Judith Pickering</a> is a psychotherapist and Jungian Analyst in Sydney, Australia. Her patient ‘Eve’ is an “anonymous, fictionalised amalgam of patients suffering disorders of self.”   Eve had a psychotic episode while attending a Tibetan  Buddhist retreat. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“She felt that she was no more than an amoeba-like semblance of pre-life  with no form, no substance, no past, no future, no sense of on-going  being.”</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2ereq31Zfg/XQai7NjZLZI/AAAAAAAAM3A/w6h_6TZWufw7LUZIaWO5-AfVU8bjaIUiQCLcBGAs/s1600/Naegleria%2Bfowleri_brain-eating%2Bamoeba2.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="507" data-original-width="710" height="285" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2ereq31Zfg/XQai7NjZLZI/AAAAAAAAM3A/w6h_6TZWufw7LUZIaWO5-AfVU8bjaIUiQCLcBGAs/s400/Naegleria%2Bfowleri_brain-eating%2Bamoeba2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Eve's fractured sense of self preceded the retreat. In fact, she was drawn to Buddhist philosophy precisely <i>because </i>of its negation of self. In the doctrine of non-being (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta" target="_blank"><i>anātman</i></a>),  “there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul, or essence in living beings.” The tenet of emptiness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81" target="_blank"><i>śūnyatā</i></a>) <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> that “all things are empty [or void] of intrinsic existence”  <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> was problematic as well. When applied and interpreted incorrectly, <i>śūnyatā</i> and <i>anātman </i>can resemble or precipitate disorders of the self.<br /><br />Dr. Pickering noted: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>‘Eve’ is representative of a number of patients suffering both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization" target="_blank">derealisation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization" target="_blank">depersonalisation</a>. They doubt the existence of the outer world (derealisation) and fear that they do not exist. In place of a sense of self, they have but an empty core inside (depersonalisation).</i></blockquote><br />How do you find your way back to your <i>self</i> after that? Will the psychotic episode respond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" target="_blank">neuroleptics</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer" target="_blank">mood stabilizers</a>?<br /><br />The current article takes a decidedly different approach from this blog's usual themes of neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopharmacology. Spirituality, dreams, and the unconscious play an important role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology" target="_blank">Jungian psychology</a>. Pickering mentions the <a href="http://web.sonoma.edu/users/d/daniels/objectrelations.html" target="_blank">Object Relations School</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory" target="_blank">Attachment Theory</a>, Field Theory, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190126041446/http://www.therelationalschool.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Relational School</a>, the Conversational Model, Intersubjectivity Theory and Infant Research.

For example, <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>teaching emptiness or <i>śūnyatā </i>to someone who is not ready can be extremely harmful.</b></span> As well as being detrimental for the student, it puts the teacher at risk of a major ethical infringement... </blockquote><br />I found Dr. Pickering's discussion of <b>Nameless Dread</b> to be especially compelling.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX984nkwjy8/XQbNwj3jHzI/AAAAAAAAM3k/tN7WwofDiZwAFhfoftrG9-chG895xvi_QCLcBGAs/s1600/mask.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="400" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX984nkwjy8/XQbNwj3jHzI/AAAAAAAAM3k/tN7WwofDiZwAFhfoftrG9-chG895xvi_QCLcBGAs/s320/mask.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><br /><b>Nameless Dread</b> <br /><br /><i>I open the door to a white, frozen mask.

<p>If you have healthy vision, there will be a specific region of your brain (in the visual cortex) that responds most strongly whenever you look at faces, and similar regions that are especially responsive to the sight of words or natural scenes. What’s more, in any two people, these face, word and scene regions are located in pretty much the same spot in the brain. However, there is not a specific region for every possible category of visible stimulus – there are no “car” or “shoe” regions, for example (at least, not that have been identified to date). Is that because childhood experience is critical for training the visual cortex – we spend a lot of time looking at faces, say, but not cars? And, if so, in theory, could a lot of childhood time spent looking at a different type of object generate its own dedicated, individual category region?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The answer is “yes”, at least according to an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8">ingenious study</a>, published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour, </i>of people who played a Pokémon game for years of their childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37328"></span></p>
<p>Jesse Gomez led the new study while a graduate student at Stanford University. He was looking for a way to test whether there’s a critical developmental window for the formation of dedicated category regions in the human visual cortex, just as there is in macaque monkeys. He needed a kind of visual stimulus that some adults had been exposed to intensively in childhood but others had not. He thought of how, from about the age of six, he, like many other kids he knew, used to spend countless hours playing a game on his Nintendo Game Boy called Pokémon Red and Blue. It involved identifying hundreds of different Pokémon characters, which look a bit like animals or mythical beasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez realised that if he could find other people who had also started playing the game intensively at about the same age, using the same device, he could explore whether this had influenced the organisation of their visual cortex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He managed to recruit 11 such adults (including himself), and scanned their brains while they were shown images of Pokémon characters, as well as other things, such as faces, corridors and cartoons. Gomez and his colleagues found that within the visual cortex (in the ventral temporal region) of the Pokémon experts, there was a discrete area that was most active when looking at the Pokémon characters. There was no such region in a control group of non-players.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other work has found that the brains of people who become experts at recognising a type of object (like cars) as an adult respond differently to those objects than the brains of novices. But these differences are not in the visual cortex; they’re more often in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attention and decision-making rather than basic visual processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on the work showing the plasticity of the visual cortex in young macaques, “the current finding of a Pokémon-preferring brain region really drives home just how amazing the plasticity of our developing visual system is,” write Daniel Janini and Talia Konkle of Harvard University in a news comment on the paper, published in the same issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Gomez and his colleagues also found that – as with face-processing or word-processing regions – the “Pokemon region” shared a similar location in all of the experts’ brains. They think that the physical size of an object’s image on the retina is important in determining where, in the brain, the category region forms. The image size of a Pokémon character viewed on an old Game Boy screen by children is consistently smaller than that of someone’s face – and a lot smaller than that of a landscape, for instance – which could have a lasting effect on the way visual representations are handled in the adult brain, the researchers think.</p>
<p>As well as being fascinating, the study has potentially important practical implications. “Our data raise the possibility that if people do not share common visual experiences of a stimulus during childhood, either from disease, as is the case in cataracts, or cultural differences in viewing patterns, then an atypical or unique representation of that stimulus may result in adulthood, which has important implications for learning disabilities and social disabilities,” the researchers write. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Consider autism, for example, which is associated with difficulties recognising faces and an aversion to eye contact. If kids with autism grow up looking at faces differently from how most children do, perhaps this explains the <a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/ffa-fusiform-facial-area-neurons-autism-recognition/">observed deficits</a> in the function of the face-sensitive region of their visual cortex, and in turn this could contribute to the social difficulties that autistic children experience. If this account is correct, then finding out how long the window of visual cortical plasticity lasts will be critical for designing effective interventions for autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/06/AT-dementia-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Assistive Technology (AT) includes devices such as electronic medication dispensers, robotic devices, GPS trackers, motion detectors, tablet computers, and wearable sensors. These devices benefit both people living with dementia and their carers:  they allow people living with dementia to remain independent, feel safe, socialize, and do things they enjoy and their carers to provide support, stay in touch, and monitor the welfare of the person with dementia.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<p>As part of <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1169-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our systematic review</a>, we completed a comprehensive search to identify research studies on carers of persons with dementia using AT. We found 56 publications, covering 50 studies, that looked at research from 19 countries. The studies were carried out predominantly in Europe and the USA, with some studies from Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan. Data was collected within these studies by a variety of methods including interviews and focus groups, surveys, video recording, and blog reviews.</p>
<p>The studies involved 2,016 carers, with 1,165 women and 660 men where gender was reported. Carers’ ages ranged from 19-91 years. The carers were from predominantly White backgrounds followed by Hispanic, African American, Asian, and ‘other’ backgrounds. Most of the carers were spouses followed by children and close family members.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>There were large differences in the uses of AT, the outcome measures used, and quality of the studies.</p>
<p>84 types of AT were described within the studies. There is so far no agreed way of describing or classifying AT and this makes it difficult to find the right AT for use by persons with dementia.</p>
<p>The AT were mainly used for leisure and social interaction, supporting memory and orientation, and for improving safety and security of the person with dementia.</p>
<p>The most commonly used AT was for safety and security. Passage and door sensors, cameras, and electronic GPS trackers were the most commonly used AT by carers to keep a person with dementia safe at home. The most widely used AT for leisure and social interaction were simple remote controls for TV and picture button telephones. Electronic clocks and calendars that oriented a person to the date, day, and time were also widely used along with electronic medicine dispensers.</p>
<blockquote><p>AT developers and industry partners should focus on technology that matches the needs of the person requiring the AT.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of the AT in these studies addressed behavioral issues such as aggression or disinhibition, which is quite common in someone who has dementia. The studies also surprisingly did not report on adverse events.</p>
<h3><strong>Carers’ experiences</strong></h3>
<p>When AT is used, carers generally appreciated using AT, but their experience of use varied. Carers’ knowledge and acceptance of AT, competence of the carer to use AT, and ethical issues when using AT were major themes that emerged from the studies.</p>
<p>Carers viewed a person with dementia’s ability to stay at home and their physical safety as more important than their privacy and autonomy. This raises some important ethical issues as carers generally purchase and make installation decisions without consulting the person with dementia.</p>
<p>AT in some instances provided carers with additional personal time which was highly valued and there was a consensus among carers that people with dementia must be involved as much as possible to select and use AT.</p>
<h3><strong>Considerations and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>Installation of AT for use by someone who has dementia is not a one-off event and is an ongoing process. Carers as users of AT often struggle to understand and engage with the AT because of poor understanding, a lack of knowledge of available AT, and lack of on-going support from professionals as well as design flaws in the AT itself.</p>
<p>Carers must be involved when designing, testing, and selecting AT for use by persons with dementia. Consideration should also be given to integrating multiple AT devices to work together.</p>
<p>We recommend the use of a standard person-centered system of classifying and naming AT devices. Healthcare professionals should consider the ability of a carer to ‘problem solve’ before AT prescription and use. AT developers and industry partners should focus on technology that matches the needs of the person requiring the AT, rather than the person being ‘molded’ to match what technology is available, and future research efforts in AT should incorporate a family/carer-centered model.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/K7xVGrRXBzk/">Spreading the Word: PLOS Advances Research Through Media Partnerships</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/06/Media-Partnership-photo-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, PLOS helped more than 2,300 articles receive media coverage in high-profile outlets including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times, the BBC, National Geographic, Scientific American </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How do we do it? For starters, our press team sends out on average one press release per day, garnering the attention of the 1200 journalists on our press list, plus members of the media who haven’t heard of us yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for us to make sure your research gets the recognition it deserves from other researchers, potential funders, and policy makers, our dedicated media team also leverages a robust network of partnerships to connect science and the media. </span></p>
<p><b>Science for non-scientists</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though all PLOS research is Open and accessible to everyone, many readers depend on journalists to distill complex scientific concepts for broader consumption. An important link in the transformation of Research Article to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NY Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cover story are Science Media Centers (SMCs) which work with journalists to get the public access to the best scientific evidence and expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through SMCs, journalists can find “sources” or vetted experts in a given field to help add context to the research they’re reporting on. Some SMCs, such as </span><a href="https://www.sciline.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SciLine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also offer </span><a href="https://www.sciline.org/evidence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fact sheets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> summarizing popular topics that have been reviewed and verified by experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working with SMCs in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany for over a year, for example by providing information that helps SMCs spread the word about PLOS work even further. In Europe, we also collaborate with the</span><a href="https://sciencemediahub.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> European Science Media Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, part of the European Parliament, whose work helps facilitate the transfer of knowledge and training between the European Parliament, the scientific community, and the media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partnership with these organizations is also helping us to shape best practice for communicating research, especially for new scholarly outputs like preprints. </span></p>
<p><b>Leveraging your network and your expertise</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the best place to seek promotion and recognition for your work is your own institution. Already, we work with top-tier institutions such as MIT, Harvard University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, the National Institutes of Health and more to help them promote the amazing research being done by their affiliated PLOS authors. We’re hoping to expand this program further, but even without formal partnership, we encourage all authors to contact their institution’s press office when their research is accepted for publication – your colleagues’ networks can be a huge asset to your career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For authors who are keen to be hands-on in disseminating research, we also recommend contacting our partner </span><a href="https://sciencetrends.com/feature-your-research-on-science-trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This free platform allows authors to write their own “self-directed press release” in under 500 words which is then published on Science Trends and on social media to an audience of 500,000 followers. You can find more information on our </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/press-and-media#loc-talking-about-research-under-embargo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re dedicated to providing the best experience for our authors, pre and post-publication. We’ll continue innovating and promoting your work and we want you to feel empowered to do so as well. Check out our </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/media-toolkit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">media toolkit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for tips on publicizing your work, speaking to the media, and stepping up your social media game.

<h4>How brains learn diseases, and their cures</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/1*slNjzwmTKuHo03_bW86V-Q.png" /></figure><p>My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.</p><p>Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are <em>cells</em>, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.</p><p>Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-to-unlearn-a-disease">epileptic patients report</a> that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-dostoevsky-epilepsy-was-a-matter-of-both-life-and-literature">aura</a>’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.</p><p>SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012372">Rivlin et al., 2013</a>). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517513/">Giaccia, Simon, &amp; Johnson, 2004</a>). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705794">Kemp &amp; Peers, 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728482/">Nei, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821532/">Richerson, 2010</a>). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615">Ling et al., 2001</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897710">P-Codrea, et al., 2005</a>), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468748">Takano et al., 2007</a>). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.</p><p>The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one <em>learned</em> by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.</p><p>The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol><li>Interestingly, SUDEP is more prevalent among males, and males tend to be more sensitive to hypoxia, suffering worse outcomes. This has been found true both in clinical studies and in studies involving multiple animal models (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474588">Hill &amp; Fitch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542909">Mayoral, Omar, &amp; Penn, 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889641">Mirza, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149081">Pérez-Crespo et al., 2005</a>). This sexual dimorphism may be due, in part, to the gene G6PD, an X-linked gene related to oxidative stress, which has been implicated in hypoxia-induced damage (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063801">Chettimada et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225644">Gao, L., et al., 2004</a>). It’s also worth noting that in a rodent model, sleep apnea-induced plasticity of the breathing circuit was normalized with antioxidant treatment, which may similarly show a protective effect in high SUDEP risk patients. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress may play an important role in detecting and preventing SUDEP.</li><li>Some researchers believe that SUDEP is related to another medical mystery, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the best known risk factors for SIDS is prenatal nicotine exposure, and nicotine exposure is known to alter receptor expression in oxygen-sensing neural circuits; therefore both diseases may result from plasticity of the brain areas responsible for controlling breathing.</li><li>SUDEP has also been associated with a variety of genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as well as several anti-convulsive drugs that also make patients prone to arrhythmias (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372310">Klassen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989471/">Glasscock, 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123">So, 2008</a>). However, genes do not deterministically dictate SUDEP risk. Given that genetic tests are costly, and only suggestive of susceptibility, a functional measurement such as apnea would likely be a more effective biomarker.</li></ol><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ced1cb1b3545" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/thoughts-on-a-medical-mystery-ced1cb1b3545">Thoughts on a medical mystery</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You should take just under two-and-a-half minutes to finish reading this blog post. That’s going by the findings of a new review, which has looked at almost 200 studies of reading rates published over the past century to come up with an overall estimate for how quickly we read. And it turns out that that rate is considerably slower than commonly thought.</p>
<p>Of the various estimates of average reading speed bandied around over the years, one of the most commonly cited is 300 words per minute (wpm). However, a number of findings of slower reading rates challenge that statistic, notes Marc Brysbaert from Ghent University in Belgium in his new paper <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/">released as a preprint on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37321"></span></p>
<p>Brysbaert searched for all studies measuring reading rates in participants aged between 17 and 60 and in languages that use the Latin alphabet. The exact nature of the studies varied a lot: for example, in some, participants had to read a long passage before answering multiple choice questions about the text, while in others they read single sentences while their eye movements were measured. But Brysbaert included only those studies in which participants read for fun or comprehension, and excluded others that require memorization or other challenges. Altogether, he found 190 suitable studies conducted between 1901 and 2019, collectively involving 17,887 participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The average reading rate across all these studies turned out to be just 238 wpm – much slower than the popular 300 wpm estimate. However, there was quite a lot of variability between studies, particularly those that used very short passages, where the slowest rate was just over 100 wpm and the fastest nearly 400 wpm. With longer texts, the rates fell more closely around the average, suggesting that longer reading tasks might be a more reliable measure.</p>
<p>Although the number of studies involving non-English languages was too small to draw any firm conclusions, there seemed to be a hint of differences between languages. For example, reading rate in the five Spanish studies was considerably faster than the average, at 278 wpm, while the average rate for the 144 English-only studies was 236 wpm. And while the meta-analysis only included participants under the age of 60, Brysbaert notes that other studies have found that reading rate declines in older age groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Knowing that reading rates are closer to 240 than 300 wpm might seem fairly inconsequential. But it does have real-world implications. These kinds of thresholds are used by educators to determine whether someone is a slow reader and in need of remedial help – so honing in on a precise number is important. “Setting the target reading rate at 300 wpm is unrealistic for the majority of people and likely to result in disappointment of what can be achieved,” writes Brysbaert.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis of past reading-rate estimates is arguably the most interesting part of the new preprint – but in fact the manuscript encompasses a lot more. If you want to find out more about the long history of reading research<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or what the fastest possible reading speed is, go and have a look at the paper. But set aside some time: at more than 19,000 words long, it will take you about 80 minutes to get through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Picture in your mind a futuristic, technologically enhanced human. Perhaps you imagined them with a subcutaneous device in their arm for phone calls and browsing the internet. Maybe they are wearing smart glasses for augmented reality. What I’d wager you didn’t think of is the presence of an artificial sixth digit attached to each hand. However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10306-w">a breakthrough open-access study in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> – the first to study the physiology and sensorimotor mechanics of polydactyly volunteers (people born with extra fingers) – shows the feasibility and practical advantages that would be gained from such an extra appendage. The results also have implications for the medical treatment of polydactyl people, who often have their extra finger removed at birth on the presumption that it will be of no benefit to them.</p>
<p><span id="more-37317"></span></p>
<p>Carsten Mehring and his colleagues conducted various tests with two polydactyly volunteers, a 17-year-old boy and his mother, both born with an extra fully formed finger between their thumb and index finger (known as preaxial polydactyly). The researchers note that polydactyly is “not rare”, with an incidence of around 0.2 per cent in the population. However, fully formed preaxial polydactyly is a rarer subset of that group.</p>
<p>Using MRI of the volunteers’ hands, the researchers established that the extra finger has a saddle joint, similar to a typical thumb, and that it is innervated by its own dedicated nerves. Further tests established that the volunteers had independent control of their extra finger and that they were able to use it to perform a pinch grip with each of their other fingers.</p>
<p>An MRI of the volunteers’ brains further showed that the extra finger was represented in the brain independently of the other fingers. Another test, that involved concealing the extra finger and asking the volunteers’ to identify landmarks on it, showed that they had an accurate mental representation of their extra digit.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers used video motion capture to observe the volunteers manipulating various objects. This showed that the volunteers engaged in a “rich ensemble of movement patterns” and that they frequently used their extra finger in coordination with both their thumb and index finger (it was not simply used as a substitute for these digits). “Taken together these results demonstrate that the movements of the six fingers of our two subjects had increased complexity relative to common five-fingered hands,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>But do these extra movement capabilities provide any functional advantage? Mehring and his team devised a video game that required coordinating key presses to respond to six boxes oscillating progressively faster up and down onscreen. A different key press was required to respond to each of the six boxes, so people with normal five-fingered hands would need two hands to succeed at the task, the researchers note. Critically, the polydactyl volunteers were able to achieve the same impressive game performance with one hand as with two.</p>
<p>Neuroscience and psychology have studied extensively the profound neural consequences for humans of losing a limb or other appendage, including documenting the pain caused by the phantom limb effect (usually explained as due to reorganisation of the brain’s representation of missing part). However, this new study represents the first neuroscientific exploration of having an extra body part, finding “… that the human nervous system is able to develop, embody and control multiple extra degrees of freedom and integrate them into coordinated movements with the other limbs, without any apparent deficits or conflicts in the sensorimotor or mental representations.”</p>
<p>This has immediate implications for the medical response to polydactyl, suggesting the need to “…thoroughly evaluate the functionality of [the extra digit] in polydactyl infants before deciding whether to remove it.” Also, from a cyborg perspective, the results “…suggest that it may be of value to augment normal five-fingered hands with an artificial supernumerary finger,” the researchers said. In fact this new research paves the wave for an entire new research endeavor. “Polydactyl individuals with functional [extra fingers] offer a unique opportunity to investigate the neural control of supernumerary limbs, analyse internal representations of body and the limits of sensorimotor capabilities in humans.”</p>

Eight months after publishing a paper claiming that homeopathy can treat pain in rats, a Springer Nature journal is retracting the work. The move follows swift criticism of the paper in Scientific Reports, which was written by researchers from India and the United Arab Emirates about the use of Toxicodendron pubescens, “popularly known as Rhus … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/06/11/permeable-to-bad-science-journal-retracts-paper-hailed-by-proponents-of-homeopathy/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">“Permeable to bad science:” Journal retracts paper hailed by proponents of homeopathy</span></a>

Over recent years, the traditional Cornish fishing harbor town has become one of the countys most popular holiday destinations, helped in part by the establishment of a chain of business by celebrity chef Rick Stein and the popularity of the local area as a domestic UK holiday choice for people including the Prime Minister David Cameron and his family. However the tourist boom has had a downside for some residents, with second home buyers driving up property prices and forcing some local people away from the town.

<p>Psychologists <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-31075-001">have noticed</a> that aspiring leaders generally pursue one of two different approaches for getting to the top of the social food-chain. Some people exert influence by building up skills or knowledge that command respect and deference from their peers – known as the prestige strategy. Others prefer to rule by fear instead, forcing others to fall into line – the dominance strategy. This dichotomy has even been suggested to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/">account for the vastly different leadership styles</a> of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But many of the studies that have looked at the dynamics of prestige and dominance have done so in artificial social situations, examining groups of strangers brought together for a short time in the lab. So in a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181621">new study published open-access in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i></a>, Charlotte Brand and Alex Mesoudi went out into the world and looked at how hierarchies based on prestige and dominance affected the behaviour of real social groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37311"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 30 community groups from Cornwall, each made up of 5 individuals and ranging from choirs to chess clubs (my favourites include a band known as Falmouth Fish Sea Shanty Collective, and a group of board game creators called Pirates of Penryn).</p>
<p>Each participant completed a 40-item quiz covering topics like art and geography, first individually and then together with their group. The groups were told they had to come to an agreement on each answer, and the group that scored the highest overall would win £500. Finally, each individual cast an anonymous vote for the group member they wanted to represent them in a set of bonus quiz questions which could win them even more money.</p>
<p>Participants also rated each member of their group on prestige (e.g. “Members of your group respect and admire them”), dominance (e.g. “They are willing to use aggressive tactics to get their way”), their likability, and how much influence they had during the quiz and in the group generally. Thankfully for the enduring survival of the groups, these ratings were all anonymous.</p>
<p>Within groups, individuals who had more influence were more likely to be rated as highly prestigious or highly dominant, consistent with previous research suggesting that both strategies can be used to gain status in social groups. Dominance and prestige ratings were not related to each other, again in-line with findings that the two strategies are quite distinct.</p>
<p>But intriguingly, neither dominance nor prestige ratings determined whether someone would be elected to take the bonus quiz – even though prestige in particular is thought to be closely tied to having superior knowledge. Instead, elected representatives tended to be those who had scored highly during the individual quiz, suggesting that the other group members had picked upon their expertise in this specific context, and made a pragmatic decision based on this, rather than being swayed by people’s status in the group more broadly.</p>
<p>These findings contrast with previous studies that suggested prestige has a greater influence over group behaviour. They perhaps illustrate the pitfalls of performing social psychology studies solely in the lab: in natural groups, where individuals have had the chance to interact and establish hierarchies over long periods of time, group dynamics may be quite different to those among strangers who have just met. Of course, a selection of community groups from Cornwall is still not necessarily representative of the wider population, and it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of prestige and dominance in more diverse groups.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to groups in the real world, the authors say, “prestige and dominance may be more domain-specific, or more fixed, than we had anticipated”. For example, group members may have gained their prestige because of a specific skillset – perhaps they were particularly good at singing or making board games – which was less useful for the general knowledge quiz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Zhao explains: “Our work shows that the motion of flapping feathered wings was developed passively and naturally as the dinosaur ran on the ground…although this flapping motion could not lift the dinosaur into the air at that time, the motion of flapping wings may have developed earlier than gliding.”</span></p>

This is the first experimental research supporting anecdotal and survey responses indicating women tend to prefer warmer room temperatures than men, by showing that temperatures can affect both comfort and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors Kajackaite and Chang summarize: “In a large laboratory experiment, over 500 individuals performed a set of cognitive tasks at randomly manipulated indoor temperatures. Consistent with their preferences for temperature, for both math and verbal tasks, women perform better at higher temperatures while men perform better at lower temperatures.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Rachel Dale notes: “This study shows that domestication did not necessarily make dogs more prosocial. Rather, it seems that tolerance and generosity towards group members help to produce high levels of cooperation, as seen in wolves.” </span></p>

<span>A professor in the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">), </span><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0278-8295">Arianna Becerril-García</a><span style="color: black;"> is also the Executive Director of </span><a href="https://www.redalyc.org/home.oa">Redalyc</a><span style="color: black;">, the Network of Scientific Journals from Latin America and the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal. Redalyc is a regional open access portal for the social sciences and humanities that indexes 1,305 local journals and hosts the full texts of more than 650,000 articles.</span></span><span> </span><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s1600/Photo_edited.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="655" data-original-width="679" height="192" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F-jRI72Qsss/XOPBUbxZzlI/AAAAAAAAlJ4/K9dkPUD5q14_1gZ5RIbDCDbovmsevN8SACEwYBhgL/s200/Photo_edited.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>In addition, Becerril-García is the Chair of a new project called </span><span><a href="http://www.amelica.org/en/index.php/que-es-ameli/">AmeliCA</a><span style="color: black;"> (Open Knowledge for Latin America and the Global South). AmeliCA’s goal is to propagate the Redalyc model to the more than 15,000 journals in the region and elsewhere in the Global South.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As Chair of AmeliCA, Becerril-García has become a vocal critic of </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a><span style="color: black;"> – the European OA initiative announced last year by a group of funders that call themselves cOAlition S. While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Heeded and acted upon?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11">rumour on Twitter</a><span style="color: black;"> is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (</span><span><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge">GLOALL</a><span style="color: black;">). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  </span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.</span><br /><a name="more"></a><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (</span><span><a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/">UAEM</a><span style="color: black;">).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – </span><span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">the oligopoly</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (</span><span><a href="https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;Src=IP&amp;Alias=WOK5">Web of Science</a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: black;"> </span></span><span style="color: black;">and <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a></span><span style="color: black;">) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Consequently, researchers are forced to publish in journals owned by commercial publishers who are mainly based outside the region, and in order to make their work open access they now have to pay an APC.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The goal of AmeliCA is to support and consolidate a native model that has operated in Latin America for more than 30 years, a model in which the publishing process is financed in a structured and rooted manner with public resources provided via local universities. This is the starting point and our aim is to demonstrate that different models of scholarly publishing have developed than one controlled by commercial publishers.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What has also been happening in our region recently is that journals that have been locally founded and developed – with public resources – and then internationalised, are being acquired by commercial publishers; there are several examples where the publisher is not an academic publisher anymore. These are journals that were created and consolidated with public resources, and then supported by Redalyc for years in order to attain international visibility.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Our view is that this kind of appropriation, and the considerable restrictions researchers now face in order to share, process and publish their work open access, among many other characteristics of the models used by big commercial publishers, are unacceptable for the development of science.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The commercial strategies that for-profit publishers have adopted for open access are ravenous, exclusionary and unsustainable.

The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>AB-G:</span></b><span> AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span><a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm">BBB definition</a></span><span>” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina.

As you will know, cOAlition S has been struggling to get global buy-in for Plan S, and has attracted criticism in the Global South for attempting to foist a one-size-fits-all Eurocentric model (as you call it) of scholarly publishing on the world. I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement?

Every stakeholder agrees with this other than those who benefit from the way things currently are. The only point of disagreement, as I said, is over how open access is achieved.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>In the South, Redalyc, AmeliCA, CLACSO, <a href="https://www.latindex.org/latindex/inicio">Latindex</a></span><span><span style="color: black;">, and <a href="http://www.lareferencia.info/en/">LaReferencia</a></span><span style="color: black;"> (amongst others) have <a href="http://reuniondeconsorcios.conricyt.mx/index.php/primera-reunion/declaraciones/?lang=en">expressed their strong objection</a></span><span style="color: black;"> to the APC model. And I expressed this clearly and vehemently at São Paolo, so I hope that the final implementation guidelines will demonstrate that cOAlition S has listened to the feedback it has received and is prepared to provide resources for non-profit players. Here I am thinking of non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools. If this happens then our engaging with cOAlition S will have led to something positive.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And if Plan S ends up dismantling the current harmful system for evaluating research and researchers based on the false prestige bestowed on publications by the Impact Factor – as called for by the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a>)</span><span><span style="color: black;"> – there is no doubt that the South would benefit.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>As to any PR benefits the São Paulo Statement may have: I wouldn’t like to think the meeting was only undertaken for media purposes.

Plan S and the general public know AmeliCA’s principles and values. We unwaveringly affirm them and will keep working towards them.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: I believe AmeliCA plans to publish a public response to the São Paulo Statement.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>In a world with magic, how much effort do you think it would take to cast a spell to make a frog appear out of nowhere? What about to turn a frog invisible? Or make it levitate? And would it be easier to levitate a frog than a cow?</p>
<p>The researchers John McCoy and Tomer Ullman recently put such questions to hundreds of participants across three studies and found they were in remarkable agreement. The findings, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217513">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217513">PLOS One</a>,</em> suggest that we invoke our intuitive understanding of the physical world – our “folk physics” – to make sense of imaginary worlds. And they help explain why fantasy TV shows and books can lose their magic as soon as it feels like anything goes. “Superman leaps tall buildings in a single bound, but a building takes more sweat than an ant-hill,” the researchers said. “And even for Superman, leaping to Alpha Centauri is simply silly.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37308"></span></p>
<p>In the first of three studies, McCoy and Ullman asked over 200 online participants (aged 18 to 83) to imagine a world in which wizards cast spells and to rank 10 spells in order of how much effort they would require. There was striking agreement across the participants that the easiest spell would be one that changed a frog’s colour and the hardest would be to conjure a frog into existence. In between, from easiest to hardest, the participants ranked the other spells as follows: levitate; teleport; make bigger; turn invisible; turn to stone; split into two frogs; transform to a mouse; and make cease to exist.</p>
<p>A second study with nearly 400 participants was similar but this time some of the participants considered the same spells but applied to a cow, or involving a greater distance than before (for instance, levitating a frog 100 feet off the ground rather than one foot). Also, this time the participants specified how many magic points would be required for each spell (providing a continuous measure of perceived effort), and the researchers converted their estimates to rank the different spells in order of difficulty.</p>
<p>Once again, there was striking agreement among participants in the relative effort required for the different spell types. For instance, the conjure spell was seen as about four times more taxing than the levitate spell. And there was agreement that the same spell type would require more effort when applied to a cow than a frog, and when greater distances were involved.</p>
<p>Across these two studies and a third (a direct replication of the second involving 600 participants), the researchers also assessed the participants’ familiarity with fantasy and magic in books, TV, movies and games. There was no evidence that exposure to fantasy and magic made any difference to participants’ estimates of the difficulty of the spells, ruling out “cultural learning” as an influence on the judgments. “We suggest that the  media does not primarily affect what spells are seen as more difficult, but rather than people bring their intuitive physics to bear when they engage with fiction,” McCoy and Ullman said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the pair note that the spells that were consistently judged most effortful – conjure, and cause to cease to exist – “… violate object permanence and cohesion, which are the earliest developing principles at the core of object understanding.” That is, even babies would have the intuition to recognise that something magical was going on if a frog suddenly appeared or disappeared out of nowhere. At the other extreme, the spells judged easiest, such as changing a frog’s colour or levitating it, “…change only accidental object properties such as location and colour.”</p>
<p>This research was conducted with US participants – it will be interesting to see if and how these findings differ in other cultures. For now, though, the results help explain why fantasy is most enjoyable when it is rooted in reality. The researchers conclude by citing the novelist George Macdonald: “The natural world has its laws, and no man must interfere with them … but they themselves may suggest laws of other kinds, and man may,  if he pleases, invent a little world of his own” – to which McCoy and Ullman add “It seems people’s little worlds do not stray far from home.”</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://www.drtimlomas.com">Tim Lomas</a></p>
<p>The novelist David Foster Wallace famously told a story of two young fish swimming in the sea, whereby an older fish glides by and asks, “how’s the water?”, to which they look at each other in puzzlement and say, “What’s water?” The central point of the parable is that we are constantly immersed in contexts to which we give little thought or consideration, but which nevertheless influence us profoundly. Among the most powerful of such contexts is language. A century of research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis (LHR; also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) has shown that the language we speak profoundly affects our experience and understanding of life, impacting everything from our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/">perception</a> of time and space to the construction of our self-identity.</p>
<p>What might the implications of the LHR be for psychology itself? As a science, the field generally aims to be neutral and objective, and to discover universal truths about the human mind. Yet it is surely consequential that the field mostly conducts its business in English, this being the default language in international journals and conferences. For instance, if a phenomenon has not been identified in English – even if it has in other languages – it is unlikely to be a topic of concern, and may not even “exist” for English-speaking scholars at all.</p>
<p>One way that the field has sought to address this limitation is by “borrowing” words from other languages and cultures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To ascertain the extent of this cross-cultural borrowing, I analysed a sample of words in psychology and recently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1615107">published my results in the Journal of Positive Psychology</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37301"></span></p>
<p>I focused on my own specialism of wellbeing and in particular on a seminal article from positive psychology, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-13324-001">published in American Psychologist</a> in 2000 by Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which inaugurated this emergent field. My approach was to identify the etymology of every word in the main text of the article using the online etymology dictionary <a href="http://www.etymonline.com">www.etymonline.com</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My findings reveal the diverse etymological roots of psychology, and of English more broadly. Of the 1333 distinct lexemes (words and their variants) in the article, ‘native’ English words – belonging either to the Germanic languages from which English emerged, or originating as neologisms in English itself – comprise only 39.4 per cent of the sample. Thus, over 60 per cent of the article’s words are loanwords, borrowed from other languages at some point in the development of English. This is higher than analyses of the percentage of borrowed words in English for other categories of phenomena, such as religion and belief (41 per cent), clothing and grooming (39), the body (14), spatial relations (14) and sense perception (11), and in English as a whole (estimated at between 32 and 41 per cent).</p>
<p>In the <em>American Psychologist</em> text, the largest contributor of loan words is Latin (44.5 per cent) – which frequently arrived via French following the Norman conquest of 1066 – followed by French itself (7 per cent) and Greek (7 per cent), with the remainder provided by modern German (0.7 per cent), Old Norse (0.5 per cent), Italian (0.4 per cent), and Arabic, Dutch, and Scottish (all 0.1 per cent). Moreover, of the words treated as English in origin, 52.1 per cent are neologisms created from other languages (mainly Latin and Greek). If such words were also deemed loanwords (or at least, loan adaptations), the number of borrowed words rises to 70 per cent.</p>
<p>One may wonder <i>why</i> psychology has borrowed so many words. Sometimes borrowing reflects the importation of new psychological theories and practices. One example is “psychoanalysis” (coined by Freud as <i>psychische analyse</i>, before being rendered in French as <i>psychoanalyse</i> then Anglicised in 1906). Other borrowed words articulate phenomena of which English speakers may already have known but not yet named or conceptualised, hence the ready adoption of terms to allow such vocalisation. For instance, behaviours we would identify as altruistic presumably occurred throughout the centuries. However, the term “altruism” was not coined until the 1830s – in French as <i>altruisme</i> by the philosopher August Comte, based on <i>autrui</i>, meaning of or to others – and soon after entered English.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>By borrowing words from other languages, psychology and our understanding of life become more nuanced and enriched. In that respect, psychology would surely do well to go further, and more consciously and actively engage with non-English languages and cultures. Indeed, this is one aim of my own <a href="http://www.drtimlomas.com/lexicography">lexicographic project</a>, which involves collecting <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/28/there-are-at-least-216-foreign-words-for-positive-emotional-states-and-concepts-that-we-dont-have-in-english/">“untranslatable” words relating to wellbeing</a> (i.e., words without an exact equivalent in English). This is an evolving and collaborative work-in-progress, which currently includes nearly 1200 words, around half of which are crowd-sourced suggestions to my website.</p>
<p>A key premise of the project is that the augmentation of English over the centuries has been a haphazard and arbitrary process – shaped especially by conceptual innovation in the “classical” world (particularly Greece around the 5<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE, and the Roman empire between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> centuries), and by the vicissitudes of geopolitical power (notably the invasion by Germanic tribes in the 5<sup>th</sup> century, and the Norman conquest in the 11<sup>th</sup> century). By contrast, English – and psychology too therefore – has largely overlooked the conceptual and lexical innovations made in more distant cultures. There are exceptions though, such as the fruitful engagement by psychology with mindfulness, derived from a Buddhist concept and practice known in Pāli as <i>sati</i>, which illustrates the great value of this kind of cross-cultural engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My project therefore proposes that the field can engage with non-English ideas and practices in a much more inclusive and systematic way (including, of course, through collaboration and co-production with scholars from the cultures in question). Through this and other such endeavours, we can continue to add to the melting pot of ideas, helping the field to continue to develop over the years ahead.</p>

<p>It all starts with <em>upstream</em> releasing a new version.</p>
<p><em>Upstream</em> are the developers of the software. We at <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> (and most
Linux distributions) are <em>downstream</em>: we take developed software, build and
integrate it all, and provide it in easily installable <em>packages</em> to users.</p>
<p>On Fedora, these packages are provided as <code>rpm</code> archives via the
repositories. Other distributions may use other formats.</p>

able to monitor different upstream release methods such as Github, PyPi,
Sourceforge, Gitlab, and so on.  When Anitya detects a new version it first
checks to see what version of this software we are currently providing in

<p>Once the bug has been filed, the next steps require manual work. There are

<p>One of the <a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig">NeuroFedora package maintainers</a> notices the bug and begins
to work on it. All notifications from bugzilla are sent to the <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/neuro-sig@lists.fedoraproject.org/">neuro-sig
mailing list</a>,
so the team is usually always aware of these.</p>
<p>First, we fetch the new source code and test it to see how it has changed in
the new release. Is it a minor release with bug-fixes and enhancements, or is
it a major release where lots of functionality has changed?</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially with development libraries, there are API/ABI changes
that make the new version incompatible with the older ones. In such cases, we
have to see how <em>all</em> other software that depends on these is affected.  This
is documented in the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/">community policy on updating software</a>. The idea is
that when new versions of software are released, as package maintainers, one of
our duties is to ensure that the new versions do not break existing
systems for our users.</p>
<p>If there is software that does not work with the latest versions, we
maintainers try to help developers update their code. Here are some examples
where we've notified maintainers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/145">Neuron: use newer libstdc++</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/113">Neuron: use a more recent SUNDIALS version</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues/627">VXL: use newer openjpeg2</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues/550">VXL: use newer DCMTK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When possible, we do try to provide patches and open pull requests. However,
this depends on how much time we maintainers have and of course, it also
depends on the complexity of the codebase.</p>

<p>In general, <strong>we try to stay as close to upstream as possible</strong>. This page

<p>If everything seems to work fine after we've managed to fix any issues, we
begin to update the Fedora package. The first step here is to update the <em>spec</em>
file. The <em>spec</em> file resides in the package's dist-git repository on
<a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/">https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/</a> where other Fedora tools can access it.
When this has been updated to build the newest release, we queue up a new build
on the <a class="reference external" href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/">Koji build system</a>.</p>
<p><em>spec</em> files provide instructions that tell the <code>rpmbuild</code> tool how to
build the software, and where all its files should go in the <code>rpm</code>
package. More information on the process can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Package_Maintainers#Introduction_to_packaging">here</a>.
You can see a relatively simple <em>spec</em> file for <code>python-indexed_gzip</code> <a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-indexed_gzip/blob/master/f/python-indexed_gzip.spec">here</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nest/blob/master/f/nest.spec">This one</a>
for the <code>nest</code> simulator, however, is a lot more complex since we must
build it with MPI support also. If you want to see a real scary <em>spec</em> file,
though, look at <a class="reference external" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/texlive/blob/master/f/texlive.spec">this one</a> for
the <code>texlive</code> package. It is auto generated from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">texlive</a> sources, but you can imagine how hard it must
be to debug.</p>

<p>The build system handles all our supported arches unless told not to do so.
Currently, the Fedora community supports: <code>x86_64, i686, armv7hl,
aarch64, ppc64le, s390x</code>. More information on these architectures can be found

<h2>4. Quality assurance: the community tests the updated packages</h2>
<p>Once the builds have completed successfully, we push the builds to our <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA">Quality

<div class="figure">

<p>It isn't enough to get the software to build correctly. We must also ensure
that it <em>works</em> correctly.  The pipeline lets community members (including
users) <em>test</em> these updated packages in a <em>staging repository</em>.</p>
<p><em>You can help test these updates.</em> All you need to do is install them, and
provide feedback. This is all explained <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing">here</a>.</p>

<p>If the packages pass the community's battery of automated checks, and testers
provide positive feedback on their functioning, they are then moved from the
staging repositories to the <em>stable</em> repositories where they are available to
all users.</p>

<h2>5. The community uses/develops/extends/shares their work</h2>
<p>When all this is done and the packages available to install via the different
package management tools (<code>dnf</code>/Gnome-software/DNFDragora/Discover),
other community members are able to use, develop, extend, share and do more
with these tools.</p>
<p>I don't like to use the word "users" because unlike let's say Nvidia who is a
"vendor" and provides software to its "users", Fedora is a community with a
large portion of people using our software also helping maintain and develop
it. Everyone who uses Fedora is already a community member, for they help us
achieve our goal---to spread Free/Open source software and awareness about it.
This is perhaps worth a whole post in itself, though.</p>

<div class="section" id="join-the-community">
<h2>Join the community!</h2>
<p>Since community projects aren't profit focussed, instead of money, the resource
we most need is man-power. Each new contributor increases the sum total man-power
possessed by the community and this enables us to work with more software, help
more developers, improve all of this software in general---get more work done.</p>
<p>If you've gotten this far, you would have probably realised that there is quite
a bit of work to be done, and there are ample opportunities where you can help

<p>The question is an old favourite – if you could travel back in time, what advice would you give to your younger self? Yet despite the popularity of this thought experiment, no one has, until now, actually studied what people would tell themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2019.1609401">Reporting their findings in </a><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2019.1609401"><em>The Journal of Social Psychology</em></a> Robin Kowalski and Annie McCord at Clemson University have done just that in two surveys of hundreds of participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. Their findings show that people’s advice to their younger selves is overwhelmingly focused on prior relationships, educational opportunities and personal worth, echoing similar results derived from research into people’s most common regrets in life. Moreover, participants who said they had followed the advice they would give to their younger selves were more likely to say that they had become the kind of person that their younger self would admire. “…[W]e should consult ourselves for advice we would offer to our younger selves,” the researchers said. “The data indicate that there is much to be learned that can facilitate wellbeing and bring us more in line with the person that we would like to be should we follow that advice.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37287"></span></p>
<p>The two studies followed a similar format with the participants (selected to be aged at least 30 years) asked to provide either three pieces or one piece of advice to their younger selves; to reflect on whether following this advice would help them become more like the person they aspire to be or ought to be; whether they had actually followed the advice later in life; to consider a pivotal event that had shaped them in life, especially in light of the advice they’d chosen to give their younger selves; and to reflect on what their younger self would make of their current self.</p>
<p>Participants mostly gave themselves advice around relationships (“Don’t marry her. Do. Not. Marry. Her.”), education (“Go to college”), selfhood (“Be yourself”), direction and goals (“Keep moving, keep taking chances, and keep bettering yourself”), and money (“Save more, spend less”). These topics closely match <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394712/">the most common topics mentioned in research on people’s regrets</a>.</p>
<p>Most participants said that the advice they offered was tied to a pivotal event in their past, such as a time they were bullied, a relationship breakup, or an incident involving drink or drugs, and about half the time they had regret for what had happened. The timing of these pivotal events was most commonly between age 10 and 30 (consistent with research into the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/09/what-your-choice-of-best-ever-footballer-says-about-human-memory/">reminiscence bump</a> – the way that we tend to recall more autobiographical memories from our teens and early adulthood).</p>
<p>Well over half the participants in both studies said that they had since followed the advice that they would offer to their younger selves. The majority of participants also said that following the advice would have brought their younger self closer to the kind of person they aspired to be, rather than making them more like their “ought self” (that is, the kind of person that other people or society said they should be). Finally, as mentioned, participants who said they’d followed their own advice (to their younger selves) were more likely to say that their younger high-school self would have respect for the person they had now grown into.</p>
<p>This is preliminary research on an unexplored topic and it’s possible the results might differ in other cultures and using other methods of collecting people’s reflections. However, the work lays the foundation for further questions, such as: how the advice we give our past selves might vary in quantity and kind as we get older; and how following the advice might affect our emotions and hope for the future. “This initial foray into advice to one’s younger self clearly raises so many interesting research questions, many of which will hopefully be examined in months and years to come,” the researchers said.</p>

<span>Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>Plan S</span></a><span>. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.</span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Simeon87 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG">CC BY-SA</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><br /><span></span><span>Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home">a petition</a> of protest being launched. <span>  </span></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/">revised guidelines</a> last week (31st May). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “</span><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s"><span>welcomed</span></a><span>” them, as </span><a href="http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/"><span>have</span></a><span> open access advocates.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were </span><a href="https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/"><span>10 funders</span></a><span>; today there are still only </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/"><span>19</span></a><span>. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the </span><a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php"><span>two largest producers of research papers in the world</span></a><span> – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.</span><br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en"><span>RJ</span></a><span>) to leave the coalition. RJ</span><span>’</span><span>s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>How, when and why did RJ leave?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 6<sup>th</sup> March RJ published </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an open letter</span></a><span> addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Leave or remain?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The next day (7<sup>th</sup> March) RJ posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20"><span>tweet</span></a><span> saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/"><span>a note</span></a><span> on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (</span><span>May 28</span><sup>th</sup><span>) RJ </span><a href="https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that it had left the coalition.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Confusingly, although the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6<sup>th</sup>, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7<sup>th</sup> March.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin">Marika Hedin</a>. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1<sup>st</sup> February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “</span><span>No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Evolved</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6<sup>th</sup>letter. It is also</span><span> not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">10 Plan S Principles</a><span>– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More puzzling perhaps, the May 28<sup>th</sup>announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>When I </span><span>asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and </span><a href="https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/"><span>Head of Open Research</span></a><span>at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31<sup>st</sup> May).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? </span><span>“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until <i>after</i> the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;A. She replied, “</span><span>Thank you, but I have no further comments.</span><span>After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Openness and transparency</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm. And this change appears to date from<a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html"> the point at which funders began to take up the cause</a> and started introducing ever more oppressive OA mandates. Increasingly, decisions are taken behind closed doors and new rules are imposed on unwilling and hapless researchers.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And is there not a hint of hypocrisy here? Principle 5 of Plan S insists that publishers must be transparent about their pricing and processes, including their </span><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/journal-transparency-rules-help-scholars-pick-where-publish"><span>editorial policies, their decision-making, their acceptance rates and their review times</span></a><span>. Researchers, meanwhile, face ever more bureaucratic scrutiny in order to ensure compliance and are threatened with sanctions if they fail to comply.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Should we not expect cOAlition S members to live by the same rules of responsibility and transparency that they seek to force on publishers and researchers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Is it not therefore incumbent on RJ to explain in more detail what it thought it was signing up to, why it signed up if it did not understand the implications of doing so, and why it subsequently chose to leave, despite apparently having had its demands met – that is, both the timetable and the implementation of Plan S were adjusted to become more flexible? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Should we not also expect decisions about open access to be decided in a democratic and open manner? How, for instance, did signatory funders make their decisions about joining Plan S and how open to scrutiny is that decision-making process?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On 27<sup>th</sup> February I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1100679321868554240"><span>invited</span></a><span> all members of cOAlition S to send me a link to, or copy of, the minutes of the meetings of the board (or similar) where it was agreed to join the coalition. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Only three funders responded and not one pointed me to any minutes.

This might seem to suggest that the </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/governance/board-governors"><span>Wellcome Board</span></a><span> (which has ultimate responsibility for Wellcome’s activities) had not been consulted. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Formas </span><a href="https://twitter.com/pressformas/status/1111600447628955648"><span>replied</span></a><span> that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been made by the Director General, with no mention of the Formas </span><a href="https://formas.se/om-formas/sa-styrs-formas/forskarradet.html#Innehall"><span>Scientific Council</span></a><span> having been asked to give approval.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And the minutes of the Board meetings of the Research Council of Norway posted on the Web suggested that the funder did not discuss Plan S until three months after it had signed up. (The minutes of the meeting appear now to have been </span><a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Saklister_og_referater/1195592857784"><span>taken down</span></a><span>). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Apart from the embarrassment of signing up to an initiative like Plan S only to have the decision later overturned by the Board, this kind of executive power grab is out of tune with the open, transparent and democratic principles that the OA movement was built on. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In its letter of March 6<sup>th</sup> RJ makes </span><a href="https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf"><span>an important point</span></a><span>: it says that by seeking to force Plan S on researchers without adequate consultation the <i>modus operandi</i> of Plan S, “has succeeded to turn researchers who have been in favour of Open Science and Robert Merton’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms"><span>CUDOS principles</span></a><span> against these positions. This is an unfortunate development.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>That perhaps is the key issue: forcing oppressive OA mandates on researchers may turn out to be counterproductive. Perhaps that is the real reason why RJ left cOAlition S: the failure to get researcher buy-in <i>before </i>announcing the initiative. But then why did RJ’s CEO sign up in the first place? Why did RJ not express concern until six months later? And why is it not willing to talk openly and publicly about what happened? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>After all, if RJ’s concerns about the dangers of seeking to force open access on researchers are valid then the issue is of wider significance than Plan S alone. It is of relevance to the very future of open access and how it is (or is not) achieved. </span></div><br />

<p>It’s well-established in psychology that intense emotion and physiological arousal interfere with people’s ability to think straight. Most theories explain this in terms of anxiety consuming mental resources and focusing attention on potential threats. Although it’s tricky to study this topic in the psych lab, a handful of field studies involving parachutists and emergency simulations have largely supported this picture. However, a team at the Autonomous University of Barcelona believe that not enough consideration has so far been given to what they call the “valence” of intense situations – whether or not the person sees the intense experience as positive or negative. To find out whether this makes a difference, Judit Castellà and her colleagues tested dozens of bungee jumpers (most of them first-timers) three times: 30 minutes before a 15M free fall jump; immediately afterwards; and again eight minutes after that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The surprising findings, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1617675">reported in </a><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1617675"><i>Cognition and Emotion</i></a>, suggest that when an intensely arousing experience is perceived positively, it may actually enhance cognition rather than be impairing. “Although we expected some degree of moderation, that is, an attenuation of the negative impact of high arousal reported in the literature, we did not predict an actual improvement or a total lack of impairment,” the researchers said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37281"></span></p>
<p>At the three testing stages conducted on a 30M high bridge in Catalonia, the bungee jumpers rated how positive or negative they were feeling, and the intensity of those feelings. They also completed tests of their working memory (the ability to recall strings of digits); their ability to concentrate and pay attention (using what’s known as the Go/No Go Task); and their decision making (their ability to identify which of four packs of cards was the most financially rewarding over time). Their performance was compared with an age-matched group of control participants who completed all the same tests in a similar environment but who were not performing a jump.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As expected, the jumpers reported far more intense emotions than the control group. Importantly, the jumpers rated these feelings as highly positive before and especially after the jump. However the main finding is that working memory actually improved in the jumpers after their jump (but not in the controls), and there was a hint that the jumpers’ decision making might have improved too. Meanwhile, the jumpers’ attention performance was unaffected. In short, bungee jumping, although perceived as an intense emotional experience, was not found to impair cognition, and in fact enhanced aspects of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Castellà and her colleagues interpreted their findings in terms of the “Broaden and Build Theory” – the idea that positive emotions can make cognitive functions more flexible and can counteract the narrowing influence of negative emotions. This is just one small study and, as always, the results need replicating and extending. However, the researchers added that their findings could have practical relevance for the training of emergency responders or any professionals who need to make rapid decisions in intensely arousing situations. “Training these professionals to cope with emergency situations by enhancing and focusing on the positive emotions derived from their actions could improve – or at least not impair – their cognitive performance when facing threats.”</p>

<p>There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">critique of the neural coding metaphor</a>, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a <em>primary</em> representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a <em>secondary</em> representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/">Mark Bickhard</a>.</p>
<p>The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">subjective physics</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural coding essay</a>, and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">in my response to commentaries</a> (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/">problematic aspects</a> with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.</p>
<p>With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons <em>is</em> the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.</p>

Building on campaign promises, President Trump has declared a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national emergency</a> to fund a wall on the US-Mexico border, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-dreamers-daca-immigration-announcement-n798686" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried to end the DACA program</a> that allows undocumented children to remain in the US, and threatened to <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180927.100295/full/#.W7GHsdt-Gns.twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change public charge rules</a>. Last month, President Trump doubled down by announcing an immigration reform proposal that would <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-05-16/trump-to-announce-new-immigration-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase border security</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/donald-trump-jared-kushner-white-house-immigration-plan-principles/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limit visas given to relatives</a> of US residents.</p>

<p>While a well-regulated immigration system is certainly important, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hispanics-forgo-health-services-to-avoid-officials-attention-advocates-say/2018/01/21/3555412e-ff1d-11e7-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.60bb356523a4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent reports</a> <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/legal-immigrants-in-seattle-area-alarmed-over-possible-penalties-for-using-benefits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the Trump administration’s efforts could lead to an unintended consequence: reducing <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1700829?casa_token=CHdj17HI_iwAAAAA:knd2T9vTo6H9mC1MVtc4B8G8wqkAIkizhkCdNsg2geRHB3FrW0geHyjR3oxRYJDgaCgZGZt7oEheX88" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">health access</a> and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1711416?casa_token=5y5swy7vY74AAAAA%3AoBrX72-FdlnA9Cctk9BGudA5BLTKSYVPHrISxJ65mfgciZxgqiCcgbnV-xgiNi1t-dFywFBxQdVLD3Q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outcomes</a> for immigrants already in the US.

<p>Given the large Hispanic immigrant population here in Texas, our research team decided to explore the relationship ourselves, investigating if and how the Trump administration’s immigration efforts have affected Hispanic immigrant health in newly published research in BMC Health Services Research.</p>
<p>To study this relationship, we conducted focus groups with health advocates and Community Health Workers across the state of Texas. These health workers serve as bridge figures between vulnerable populations like immigrant communities and the health system. In detailed discussions held in major cities (Houston and Dallas), border regions (El Paso and McAllen), and more rural parts of Texas, these experienced health workers provided insight into the barriers faced by documented and undocumented Hispanics across the state. Our research identified several key changes in Hispanic health that the Trump administration’s efforts have brought about.</p>
<h3><strong>Fear is on the rise</strong></h3>
<p>Across our discussions with these health workers, perhaps the most common theme was that fear is on the rise among Hispanic populations. While fear is ever-present in daily life for undocumented immigrants, our participants noted growing fear in the current political environment. For example, one health worker noted that “when he (President Trump) became president, it was noticeable the fear was rising” and another noted that it is “immobilizing people” and that “fear has become a factor of life.” Interestingly, health workers in Houston noted that this fear was particularly problematic during Hurricane Harvey – as many Hispanics avoided the help they needed because in some cases, Customs and Border Patrol boats were being used for water rescues.</p>
<blockquote><p>The policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Policies and rhetoric matter for health</strong></h3>
<p>This fear, which health workers attributed to the Trump administration’s policy efforts as well as the President’s rhetoric, is decreasing access to needed health services for Hispanics across Texas. For example, one health worker noted that in the wake of a statement by President Trump on immigration, health clinics were deserted: “It was like a Friday… he [Trump] was threatening to deport people left and right. That next Monday and almost the entire week, our clinics, everybody didn’t even cancel, they didn’t show up. They were terrified.” Our participants have suggested that this trend is pervasive across Texas. As the President and his administration continue to emphasize immigration, people are avoiding engaging in many of the activities typical in daily life, including visits to health care providers.</p>
<h3><strong>Children’s nutrition is at risk</strong></h3>

<p>According to health workers in Texas, the policies and rhetoric of the Trump administration have been particularly impactful for children. Our research suggests that children who are eligible for food assistance through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are not getting the nutritional services they need. Some immigrant parents, fearful of their enrollment information being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are dis-enrolling their families in these programs that provide important nutritional services. As one health worker noted, many clients “say I’m not renewing because if I renew I’m going to get deported. So we lost a lot of people… their kids are the ones that were suffering.”</p>
<h3><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h3>
<p>Together, our research suggests that as the Trump administration continues to pursue a hard line on immigration, Hispanic health access could continue to decline. As fear rises, many are not seeking out the social services that they need, affecting documented and undocumented immigrants in Texas, as well as their children. With additional immigration reforms under consideration, health officials in Texas and beyond need to be aware that vulnerable populations may be facing additional barriers to getting the care they need.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/cMZuq99n1yk/">Looking Good: Tips for creating your PLOS figures graphics</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/art-color-color-palette-159560-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Enhance your research with tips and tools from the experts on the PLOS Production Team. This post is part of our new Format for Success series where we’ll share advice for generating figures and graphics that make submitting a breeze. Stay tuned for more. </em></p>
<p>We know that preparing graphics files can be one of the most challenging parts of submitting your hard work to a publisher, when you would rather be observing in the field, experimenting in the lab, or conversing with the community. Like you, we want your research to shine and be noticed by your peers, adding to the scientific discourse and fostering collaboration in and across disciplines.</p>
<p>To help you create the best images possible and ensure a smooth article production experience, we’ve put together our top tips, distilled to a few major areas, for assessing your graphics files during submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider raster images vs vector images</strong> – <em>Raster images</em> are made of pixels. A pixel is a single point or the smallest single element in a display device. <em>Vector images</em> are mathematical calculations from one point to another that form lines and shapes, which adjust to fit a monitor display and zoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our journal article pages use raster graphics for in-article figure display, the lightbox figure viewer, and carousel thumbnails.  Raster graphics are easier to create, store, and transfer across platforms, but limit resolution to 600 dpi. Alternatively, vector graphics are only available in the article PDF accessed online, but will result in a more detailed image at high zoom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a resolution between 300 and 600 dpi</strong> – Effective resolutions below 300 dpi (dots/pixels per inch) often result in a blurry, jagged or pixelated image that is not optimal to publish, and resolutions above 600 dpi frequently must be resized or rescaled. We are required by the PLOS publishing platform, and community indexes like PubMed Central, to ensure content adheres to these resolutions.</li>
<li><strong>Combine multi-panel images</strong> – Often, it’s useful to exhibit a Part A, Part B, and Part C, all within one figure image. To create a multi-paneled figure from individual images, we suggest using a presentation program like PowerPoint, Word or GIMP to arrange your panels, create labels, and scale or size your figures. Multi-paneled figures need to fit into a single page or be broken apart into separate figures in order to publish clearly and accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Flatten image layers</strong> – Unflattened images can incorporate alpha channels, which include a transparent layer potentially containing “junk”, “artifacts”. Sometimes, an unflattened image can also render a figure into a complete black or white rectangle, obscuring all your content. We recommend that you flatten your graphics to combine all the layers into a single background layer, so we can ensure the quality of the output equals your intent.</li>
<li><strong>Compress file size with LZW compression</strong> – Data compression helps to reduce file size and also decreases time required to download and upload content. With compressed files, we can help you reduce the size of your article PDF, improving a researcher’s ability to access your work and send it to colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using PACE</strong></p>
<p>To help you assess your figure images, PLOS also offers authors a free, web-based imaging review tool, <a href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">PACE</a>, that evaluates figures against our platform requirements and fixes the most-common image issues, detailing any changes made, or informs the user what outstanding issues may exist.  PACE compiles two, online review options in the form of typeset page mockups to give users an idea of how the uploaded image would appear in the final article. To use PACE, simply register with your email address: <a href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to undertaking a scientific protocol, PLOS’s production team follows specific rules to ensure that the accepted content is correctly transformed to XML and PDF in order to publish accurately in our journal sites and syndication targets. In short, graphic images must generally conform to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>File format</em> – TIFF or EPS</li>
<li><em>Dimensions</em> – Width: 789 – 2250 pixels (at 300 dpi). Height maximum: 2625 pixels (at 300 dpi).</li>
<li><em>Resolution</em> – 300 – 600 dpi</li>
<li><em>File size</em> – 10MB or under</li>
<li><em>Figure files naming</em> – Fig1.tif, Fig2.eps, and so on. Match file name to caption label and citation.</li>
<li><em>Caption</em> – Place within the manuscript as simple text, not within the figure file</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve posted additional graphics recommendations, as well as instructions for exporting graphics from specialized software, here: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures</a>.</p>
<p>We hope these suggestions make figure preparation even easier so you can spend more time advancing your field and we can publish your work faster than ever.  We encourage you to email us at <a href="mailto:figures@plos.org">figures@plos.org</a> with further questions.</p>

<p>The idea that more talkative parents have children with superior language or cognitive skills has a long – and sometimes controversial – history. An influential study from the early 1990s claimed that American children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have poorer language development because they hear fewer words from their parents. But scientists have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/01/615188051/lets-stop-talking-about-the-30-million-word-gap">pointed out several issues with this early research</a> – including that it involved researchers going into people’s homes to record them, potentially affecting the language they used.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Since then, other researchers in the United States have researched families’ use of language in a less intrusive way – and found that any effects may be more subtle than originally claimed. Now, in what they say is the “largest naturalistic observation study of early life home environments to date”, scientists have brought these methods across the pond. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23388-001">study of more than 100 London families</a>, published recently in <i>Developmental Psychology</i>, has found that the quantity of language used by parents <i>is</i> related to children’s cognitive skills – but exactly why remains unclear.</p>
<p><span id="more-37273"></span></p>
<p>Katrina d’Apice from the University of York and her colleagues equipped 107 children aged between two and four with wearable devices that recorded all language spoken by them or their family for three days. Software then automatically processed the recordings, which averaged 15 hours per day, to calculate how many words were spoken by the adults in the family. The children also completed a series of cognitive tests, which involved tasks like copying and drawing.</p>
<p>The researchers found that adults spoke an average of 17,800 words per day – but this varied considerably. Even within families, the number of words spoken by adults across different days was only moderately correlated. “Our findings emphasize that early life experiences, especially with regard to language, are dynamic processes that change and evolve over time, rather than static environmental determinants,” the researchers said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the team found that, overall, adult word counts were related to children’s cognitive skills: children whose parents used more words tended to do better in the cognitive tests.</p>
<p>The team also looked at the richness of parents’ and children’s vocabulary, finding that children had a greater lexical diversity when adults’ vocabulary was also more diverse.</p>
<p>The correlational design of the study means it’s impossible to tease apart cause and effect, so there are a number of possible explanations for the findings. It could be that more exposure to language fosters children’s intelligence, for example. Or parents could simply be stimulated to talk more when their children are smarter. There could also be shared genetic effects influencing both the parents’ language and children’s cognitive abilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Whether these results generalise to other groups remains to be seen – more than 80 per cent of parents in this study held a university degree; almost all of them were married; and they were mostly high socio-economic status. Nevertheless, the use of discreet recording devices and automatic language processing software would seem to open up the field to many more naturalistic studies like this in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>We move house, change jobs, begin new relationships, yet most of the time, most of us still experience a thread of inner continuity – a constant feeling of me-ness that transcends the various chapters of our lives. Indeed, there’s evidence that having a stable, constant sense of self and identity is important for psychological wellbeing. However, this thread can rupture, leading to an uncomfortable disconnect between who we feel we are today, and the person that we believe we used to be – a state that psychologists recently labelled “derailment”.</p>
<p>Now in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702619829748">paper</a> in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em> a group led by Kaylin Ratner at Cornell University has explored the possibility that derailment both precipitates, and is a consequence of, depression. After all, people with depression often struggle with motivation, losing the will to pursue goals they previously held dear. They also frequently withdraw from their relationships and social roles. All of these changes could trigger sensations of derailment. Or perhaps derailment comes first, with the inner disorientation leaving one vulnerable to depression. Surprisingly these questions have been little studied before now. “We nominate derailment as a new feature of the depressive landscape and underscore the need for greater empirical and practical attention at the crossroads of mental health and human development,” Ratner and her team write.</p>
<p><span id="more-37243"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited nearly a thousand undergraduate students and asked them to complete measures of depression and derailment four times over the course of an academic year. The recently developed 10-item derailment measure was based on the students’ agreement or not with statements like “My life has been headed in the same direction for a long time,” and “I did not anticipate becoming the person that I currently am.”</p>
<p>The team found that the students’ scores on depression and derailment were relatively stable across the course of the year. Also, students’ derailment and depression symptoms tended to correlate at each of the measurement time points – implying there may well be an association between the two. In terms of cause and effect, and as the researchers predicted in advance, higher depression scores at an earlier time point tended to presage increases in derailment scores later on. However, in what they described as a “curious finding”, higher derailment scores earlier in the year actually tended to herald a <em>decline</em> in depression symptoms later in the year.</p>
<p>Ratner and her team propose a number of explanations for this last finding – including that while derailment may be uncomfortable at first, it may catalyze people to withdraw from relationships and/or goals that are unfulfilling, thus leading to wellbeing gains in the longer term. The researchers also pondered whether there might be moderating factors that alter whether derailment leads to increases or reductions in depression – such as whether people find meaning in their feelings of derailment, and/or how much they end up ruminating over the feelings. Such questions remain for future research, as do many other outstanding issues, such as how derailment and depression might be related in other non-student groups and over longer time periods.</p>
<p>“Although derailment is a novel construct and one that is still in the process of being mapped, researchers and practitioners would be keen to take note of derailment being a feature of depression’s landscape and continue to observe how such perceived changes in identity and self-direction could take shape and act within clinical presentations,” the researchers said.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/breastfeeding-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Zimbabwe is working towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. All pregnant and breastfeeding women who are HIV-infected are initiated on Option B+ treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women on this regimen are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for six months along with starting or continuing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Exclusive breastfeeding is not an easy feat, particularly for HIV-infected mothers. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2336-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our study</a> explored the challenges faced by these women on the PMTCT program.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges in implementing and studying PMTCT</strong></p>
<p>Our study is premised on the assumption that the biomedical framework of ART initiation has informed most of the studies on PMTCT at the expense of the social model of health.  The complex interactions of the biological, psychological and social processes that shape behavior have not been seriously considered.  Mothers on PMTCT are not considered within the context of the broader environmental factors that influence their behavior. Policymakers often do not account for cultural factors when introducing interventions to address societal problems.</p>
<p>Although there are multiple advantages from the ‘test, treat, and breastfeed all infants’ strategy of PMTCT, a plethora of challenges can compromise and prevent the achievement of the desired health benefits for both the mother and her infant. These include HIV-related stigma, fear of transmitting HIV to the baby, and  ART side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Women’s struggles, in their own words</strong></p>
<p>Women in our study struggled with exclusive breastfeeding, which was promoted by the health professionals and policy makers. There was consensus among the women regarding their fear of infecting their infants through the breast milk. One woman felt that the nurses were cruel by insisting that they breast feed: <em>“If these nurses were HIV positive would they breastfeed”?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our qualitative study revealed that stigma, both enacted and felt, was a reality. One woman felt that people gossiped about her HIV status: <em>“ Whenever I approach people they change the subject and you can tell they were talking about you,”</em> while another felt that people did not want to be near her: <em>“It is as if I have a stench.” </em>Health providers, perhaps unintentionally, enhanced the stigma by attending to HIV-infected patients at specific times and labeling them as <em>“those for tablets</em>” (a local term used for people on ART).</p>
<p>This concern about stigma further challenged the women’s adherence to exclusive breastfeeding, fearing that it would be tantamount to giving away one’s HIV status, as it is against the community norms of infant feeding which involves giving water, traditional medicines and foods.</p>
<p>Disclosure of HIV status to family was also a major challenge which negatively impacted on the women’s ability to follow through with exclusive breastfeeding. The women, despite the knowledge received from the health workers, ended up mixed feeding their babies and not adhering to their ART medication due to fear that their families would find out their status. One of the women said, <em>“When I was diagnosed HIV positive during antenatal care, I (hypothetically) asked my husband for his reaction … he became so livid … I hide my medication in the garden ….”</em></p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<p>This study clearly shows that the success of the PMTCT program cannot be merely measured by uptake of Option B+, which rose from 65% to 99% in 2018. Taking cognizance of the contextual factors where interventions are being introduced is key. Policy makers should recognize the importance of culture when introducing programs that address societal problems. There is a need to address cultural practices which could lead to HIV infection in babies during the postnatal period, such as giving babies traditional medicines and other foods. Programs should be aware that a ‘one size fits all’ approach does not work.</p>
