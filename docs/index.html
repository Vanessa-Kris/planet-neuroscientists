                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/606904576/0/oupblogpsychology/">Cancer patient or cancer survivor? Understanding illness identity.</a></h4>

<p>The good news is that many people now survive their cancer. They are either cured or live with cancer as a chronic illness. However, life after cancer can vary between cancer survivors. Some are almost symptom free and return to a normal life after completion of treatment, while others could experience persistent side effects of cancer and treatment long after treatment has ended.</p><p>With the number of people living with cancer growing, there is increasing interest in how these people perceive themselves and their illness.  With the advent of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953608001809">cancer advocacy</a>, traditional terms such as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-009-0993-x"><em>cancer patient</em> or <em>cancer victim</em></a>, are being replaced by the more empowering <em>cancer survivor</em>. Although some might consider the differences in these terms as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182266">semantics</a>, many argue the label <em>cancer patient</em> is dehumanizing, emphasizing the disease over the people themselves.</p><p>So why is understanding illness identity important? For example, people who consider themselves as patients might feel less empowered to contribute actively to their treatment decisions, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622019">deferring</a> instead to the treating medical specialist. On the other hand, people who are still grappling with cancer and its after effects might feel <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953608001809?via%3Dihub">alienated being described as a <em>survivor</em></a>, perceiving that their struggles or feelings of suffering are not validated.  Previous research report that people who perceive themselves as patients were more likely to be <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07357900600896323">depressed</a> and have <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12110">poorer quality of life</a>. In contrast, people who identify themselves as cancer survivors report <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11764-016-0521-z">better health outcomes</a>.</p><p>In Germany, it is still not common for people living with cancer to describe themselves as a <em>cancer survivor</em>. About a third of people there who had been previously diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer still considered themselves cancer patients 5 to 15 years after the diagnosis. This perception is associated with many factors, such as type of cancer treatment received, whether the disease has recurred or progressed, whether a new cancer is diagnosed, and psychological problems. People who still consider themselves patients were also more likely to make cancer-related visits to a health care specialist or facility.</p><p>Besides illness identity, we also need to consider <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515801">illness perceptions</a>. People with similar clinical characteristics could have vastly different interpretations of the seriousness of their illness. How people perceive and respond to their cancer and treatment could be important in how they cope with and adapt to life after cancer. These perceptions can be shaped by previous experience, current observations, or shared information on illness and symptoms. People with negative or pessimistic illness perceptions were more likely to report poorer self-management of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028218">illness side effects</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664984">less likely to stick to treatment recommendations</a>, report higher levels of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gray%2C+predictors%2C+anxiety%2C+colorectal+cancer">problems like depression and anxiety</a>, and make <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30215142">more visits to health specialists</a> for general or cancer-related matters. Furthermore, negative perceptions have been associated with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192384">poorer quality of life and a higher risk of mortality</a>. However, these negative perceptions <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006141">can be fixed</a>. Therefore, health care providers should consider exploring and identifying perceptions that could be unhelpful to adapting to living with cancer. Addressing how people see their cancer in a more positive light may reduce further medical problems and improve well-being.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Man and Woman Raising Hands” by rawpixel.com.

<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p2"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">A concept that’s increasingly recognised as important in relation to pressure is your “stress mindset”. If you recognise that stressful challenges can sharpen your focus, strengthen your motivation, and offer learning and achievement opportunities, then you have a “positive” stress mindset. In contrast, viewing stress as unpleasant, debilitating and negative constitutes a “negative” stress mindset. And there’s evidence that this is harmful. A 2017 study led by Anne Casper found that when faced with a day that they know is going to be challenging, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/05/whats-your-stress-mindset/">people with a positive stress mindset come up with coping strategies</a>, boost their performance, and end the day feeling more energised. For people with a negative stress mindset, the opposite happens.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">Alia Crum at Stanford University is one of the best-known advocates of the positive stress mindset. She’s found that it’s not just adults who benefit. In a study of adolescents, Crum and her colleagues found that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.12946">those who believed in the potential benefits of stress were less prone to feeling stressed in the wake of difficult life events</a>. “These findings suggest that changing the way adolescents think about stress may help protect them from acting impulsively when confronted with adversity,” the researchers concluded.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">If you do have a negative stress mindset, there are ways to turn it around. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10615806.2016.1275585">In another study</a>, Crum’s team found that adult participants who’d watched a film clip that focused on the “enhancing” nature of stress, and were then put into a stressful social situation, afterwards felt more positive and showed greater cognitive flexibility than participants who’d first watched a “stress is bad” clip. </span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">If you’re feeling anxious because you’re under increased pressure at work, or there’s a particularly challenging opportunity/stressful event (you now know which adjective you should pick…) coming up, one short-term fix might be to go and watch a horror movie. Deliberately scaring ourselves can calm the brain, leading to a “recalibration of our emotions,” according to a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/31/deliberately-scaring-ourselves-can-calm-the-brain-leading-to-a-recalibration-of-our-emotions/">US study led by Margee Kerr which involved visitors to an immersive theatre attraction at the ScareHouse in Pittsburgh</a>.

<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">The evidence from this particular study is not strong. But some support for the idea that trying to big yourself up, rather than to put yourself down, can help in high pressure situations comes from a study in which Sonia Kang at the University of Toronto and her team studied a group of MBA students. The researchers put some into positions of low power in a negotiating situation, and found that these participants performed worse under pressure than those who’d been given more power over the outcome. However, when “low power” students first spent five minutes writing about their most important negotiating skill, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167215577365">this neutralised the power differential effect on performance</a>. “Anytime you have low expectations for performance, you tend to sink down and meet those low expectations,” Kang observed. “Self-affirmation is a way to neutralize that threat.”</span><u></u></p>

Researchers Fandong Chen and Ian Krajbich, based in China and the US, found that when there was little time available to make a decision about how to divide a pot of money, selfish people tended to act more selfishly than usual, while pro-social people behaved even more pro-socially.

<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">You might hope for a text message from a friend or romantic partner. Recent research from Emily Hooker and colleagues confirms that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/01/sending-a-supportive-text-to-your-partner-can-reduce-their-physiological-stress-levels-but-only-if-youre-subtle-about-it/">sending a text to a partner confronted with a difficult task really can make them feel more supported</a>. This particular study involved 75 women who were asked to do a set of stressful tasks, including mental maths and public speaking, while their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. While they were waiting to perform, some received text messages from their romantic partner, who was waiting in another room. These scripted texts were either explicitly supportive (for example, “Don’t worry. It’s just a psych study. You’ll be fine”), whereas others were more mundane (“It’s cold in here”).</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">Analysis of the physiological data revealed that the mundane texts, though not the “supportive” ones, reduced the women’s blood pressure during both preparation and the task itself. When you’re under psychological pressure, being reminded that there’s someone out there who really cares for you seems to be more helpful than receiving targeted advice. In fact, the potential risks of offering “helpful” advice have been highlighted in other work. </span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/ocp0000135">recent meta-analysis</a> of 142 studies looking at how to help struggling employees concluded that simply making job-related support available — for example, new equipment or career counselling — is often helpful, but overtly discussing a problem can backfire. “That finding might be because not all support is good support,” said Michael Mathieu at San Francisco State University, who led the study. For example, reaching out to try to help a co-worker might be taken as an insult, he suggests.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">If your partner somehow neglects to send a simple reminder of their implicit support before you go into your important meeting, or stand up to give that paper, they may still be able to help you. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psyp.13324">Just visualising your partner can moderate your body’s physiological response to stress</a>, according to research at the University of Arizona led by Kyle Bourassa. (In this study, the stressor was physical – volunteers had to submerge their feet into cold water – but in theory, the same effect could hold for other forms of stress.) In some trials, participants actually had their partner in the same room. These people reported less pain than those who just imagined that their partner was there, but the blood pressure data for the two groups were statistically equivalent. “The results suggest that accessing the mental representation of a romantic partner and a partner’s presence each buffer against exaggerated acute stress responses to a similar degree,” the researchers write.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p4"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1"><b>Choking and clutch</b></span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p2"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">It’s possible that, in modulating physiological arousal, this kind of technique may reduce the risk of choking under pressure. This phenomenon is familiar to many of us. When the pressure gets “too much”, our skills suddenly deteriorate, and we perform more poorly than we, or anyone else, expected. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon has been extensively studied in sport. One analysis of the performance of elite tennis players, led by Danny Cohen-Zada, concluded that the male players were about <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/31/elite-female-tennis-players-less-prone-to-choking-under-pressure-than-elite-male-players/">twice as adversely affected by high pressure as the female players</a>, perhaps because men typically show a bigger spike in levels of the stress hormone cortisol when under pressure than women do. (“Our robust evidence that women can respond better than men to competitive pressure is compelling</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">,” the researchers noted.)</span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">The opposite to choking under pressure is sometimes called “clutch performance”. A group led by Christian Swann at the University of Wollongong, Australia interviewed 16 top athletes and asked them to describe what they were thinking and feeling during a recent outstanding “clutch” performance. This led them to identify <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/29/what-is-the-psychological-state-underlying-clutch-performance-excelling-under-pressure/">12 characteristics associated with excelling under pressure</a>. Six were similar to the state of flow (they became so involved in their task they became unaware of the crowd, for example). But six were different. They included being deliberately focused on the task in hand, maintaining intense effort over a period of time, feeling high arousal levels, and not thinking about what would happen if they failed. The athletes talked about making a big effort to monitor their own performance as they played, to raise their game. (It’s worth noting that though the athletes talked about feeling high levels of arousal, their actual physiological arousal was not monitored. There’s certainly work finding that arousal helps with performance — only to a point.)</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">It’s interesting that the athletes mentioned not thinking about the negative consequences of failure. Because this brings us back to mindsets. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/28/a-surprising-new-way-to-avoid-choking-under-pressure-imagine-you-have-the-prize-and-are-performing-to-keep-it/">Work published earlier this year</a> (led by Vikram Chib) found that simply altering how you view what’s at stake in a high-pressure situation can dramatically reduce the risk of choking.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">The participants in this study were asked to play a computer-based game in which they could win money. But when they were instructed to imagine that they already had the high prize money on offer, and were playing for the chance to keep it, rather than to gain it, they were much less likely to choke. (The researchers tied this to altered levels of activity in a region of the brain called the ventral striatum.) A skin conductance measure also showed that this reappraisal prevented heightened stress when they failed. Playing make-believe had, it seems, taken the pressure out of the situation.</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-6758502693039026223p3"><span class="m_-6758502693039026223s1">More work needs to be done to explore the potential benefits of this approach, as well as the positive stress mindset, in real-world situations. But next time you’re under pressure to perform, why not try embracing the opportunity to achieve — and imagine that you’ve already succeeded?</span><span class="m_-6758502693039026223apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u><u></u></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>What kind of person posts a lot of selfies on their Instagram account? It has been suggested that such people are more narcissistic, but the research results on this are inconclusive. However, a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2019.07.001">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, has found that whatever the actual personality traits of those who post plenty of selfies, other people have a clear opinion about them — and it’s not good.</p>
<p><span id="more-37833"></span>Instagram is an “increasingly ubiquitous” platform for social interaction, note the researchers, led by Christopher Barry at Washington State University, so it’s clearly important to understand how the kinds of photos people post affect others’ impressions.</p>
<p>The team first recruited 29 university students, aged 18 to 27, who had at least 30 photos on their Instagram accounts. The researchers took screenshots of these images, and also asked the participants to complete questionnaires that measured their levels of narcissism, self-esteem, “fear of missing out”, loneliness, sensation-seeking, and Big Five personality traits.</p>
<p>Each of the participant’s 30 most recent Instagram photos were then coded by independent raters as being a selfie, a “posie” (a shot of the participant taken by someone else), or a photo without the participant in it. Raters also classified each selfie and posie by theme — whether it concerned physical appearance, affiliation with others, or an event or activity, for example.</p>
<p>For the next stage of the study, 199 students from a different university were shown each set of 30 images on a screen. For each set, they were asked to rate the individual portrayed on 13 attributes, including loneliness, success, extraversion, absorption, dependability, emotionality, being considerate of others, and so on.</p>
<p>This second group was generally not great at assessing the Instagrammers’ actual personality attributes, as measured in the first part of the study, although they did seem able to glean some slight insights from the photos. For instance, students in the first group who scored higher for “grandiose narcissism” and self-esteem were perceived as being more self-absorbed.</p>
<p>But the raters were in pretty clear agreement with each other. People with more selfies were seen as being less likeable, less successful, more insecure and less open to new experiences — while those with more posies tended to be seen more positively. “Even when two feeds had similar content, such as depictions of achievement or travel, feelings about the person who posted selfies were negative and feelings about the person who posted posies were positive,” <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190820085823.htm">comments Barry</a>. Selfies related to physical appearance — showing muscles being flexed in a mirror, for example — were given especially negative ratings.</p>
<p>There were some hints of relationships between actual personality attributes and the likelihood of posting selfies vs posies (for example, participants higher in narcissism were<i> less</i> likely to post selfies). But these associations were not strong.</p>
<p>What might explain the perceptions reported by the second group? The team has a few ideas. It could be that posies are preferred because they look more natural, portraying the individual in the way they’d be seen in real life. Or perhaps selfies — which were posted far less frequently than posies — stand out as signalling something unusual about the individual.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the work. First, the 29 students in the initial group represent a fairly small sample, and only eight were men. It’s not clear whether a perceiver’s own gender might affect their judgements of people of the same or different gender. And the raters’ only source of information about the individuals were their photos. All text — another clear source of potential personality information — was stripped out.</p>
<p>Still, the research is certainly intriguing. “While the findings of this study are just a small piece of the puzzle, they may be important to keep in mind before you make that next post,” says Barry.</p>

<p>The most efficient therapy to many diseases is often the result of a combination of drugs. Administration of more than one molecule in cases of cancer, hypertension, asthma and AIDS can lead to an increase in drug efficiency and decrease in toxicity and resistance by the target cells. Nevertheless, different molecules can also interact in a detrimental way for the body. Hence the importance of being aware if multiple drugs are prescribed to patients. Different studies have been carried out, trying to foresee possible drug-drug interactions inside the body. <em>In vivo</em> testing is often limiting because it requires a long time to screen different compounds. <em>In silico</em> studies, instead, have proved to be more powerful.</p>

<p>Computational methods, usually, take into account known characteristics of molecules, such as structure, target and side effects. An article published this month by Lee <em>et al.</em> in <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Bioinformatics</em></a> shows the formulation of a new deep learning model to predict drug-drug interaction, that takes into consideration three concepts: target similarity profiles (TSP), Gene Ontology (GO) term similarity profiles (GO term gives information about the gene function, where it acts inside the cell and in which biological process it is involved) and Structural similarity profiles (SSP). Three similarity profiles are traced for any given drug pair. These are then joined together to provide an estimation of the level of interaction between the two molecules. This approach allowed the authors to identify, with the same or greater accuracy, drug-drug interactions that were characterized using different methodologies.</p>

<p>Incidence of lung cancer in the population increases with age and it is rarely diagnosed in young people. It has been shown that clinic-pathological features of lung cancer in younger and older patients are not the same. However, previous research in the field has not shown conclusive results and still remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this study carried by researchers of Zhejiang University (China), specimens of cancer cells from 89 young patients (35 years old or younger) with adenocarcinoma were analyzed. The majority of patients were women and only 1 in 10 were smokers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prognosis was also seen to vary according to the mutations involved in cancer onset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next-generation sequencing was used to identify the mutation of 59 cancer-related genes. The most frequently mutated genes identified were ERBB2 (Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). Fusion of ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (receptor tyrosine kinase) genes was also characterized as responsible for oncogenesis. No significant correlation was seen between the mutations (or fusion) identified, the gender or the smoking habit of the patient. Overall, a prevalence of ERBB2 mutations was characterized in well/moderately differentiated tumors, while EGFR mutations and ALK fusions were identified in moderately/poorly differentiated tumors. Prognosis was also seen to vary according to the mutations involved in cancer onset.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11279" style="width: 365px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11279" height="236" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/iStock-653873888-300x200.jpg" width="355" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Wavebreakmedia / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Maternal mortality rates in developing countries are still unacceptable and although policies were made by local governments, around 830 women still die every day because of pregnancy or childbirth complications. 99% of these deaths happen in developing countries and they are, in most cases, preventable.</p>
<p>Nigeria is one of the countries with the highest maternal mortality rate, with peaks in rural areas. In 2014, the government launched a program to provide primary health care for vulnerable populations. Despite the efforts, rural pregnant women did not make use of this service and are not receiving medical support during pregnancy and delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>Women also reveal that often the quality of care is not adequate</p></blockquote>
<p>A qualitative study in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> investigated the reasons underlying women’s dangerous choice of not using the primary health care facilities provided. Discussion through focus groups allowed the authors to identify some major themes behind this trend. Participants underlined the difficulty in reaching the health centers, as paved road are non-existent and it is risky to use the bad roads available. Difficulty in obtaining a mean of transportation and distance to the facilities were also identified as important barriers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants stated that those clinics are not open at all times and taking a trip there and finding them closed discouraged them from using the health care facilities on other occasions.</p>
<p>Strikingly, women also reveal that often the quality of care is not adequate; there is not medication to alleviate the pain, waiting times are long, the environment is not friendly and the healthcare professionals are not supportive or competent. This, in addition to the belief that traditional medicine and divine intervention would do just as much as the staff of the health centers, pushes women to avoid seeking this type of professional help. Finally, participants also mentioned that the cost of care is arbitrary and often these facilities request patients to buy consumables from them, which can be expensive.</p>
<p>All things considered, this study suggests that the governmental solution to maternal mortality is still far from being adequate. Improvement in facility accessibility and in the quality of care would motivate women to rely on professional help during pregnancy. However, much work still needs to be done in this direction.</p>

<p>The majority of people with dementia live in the community but receive care mostly from family members or friends. Caring for a loved person affected by this condition can be extremely challenging, especially with the progression of the disease and towards end of life.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University College of London designed and developed an online palliative care support website, targeting real problems of carers of people with dementia at the end of life. Among the negative effects of taking care of a relative with dementia are depression, poor physical health and poor quality of life. Researchers are positive that this tool will help carers in their role and help to improve their overall well-being.</p>

<p>Heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis can be insistent and impair daily activities, such as walking or running. Around 7% of the population suffers from this condition. In many cases, rest or change of habits can be sufficient to relieve the symptoms with time. However, if symptoms persist, it can be necessary to resort to different approaches, such as physiotherapy or Corticosteroid injections as they help lessen pain and inflammation. It is still unclear why Corticosteroid injections are prescribed so often, since evidence of their mode of action are still lacking.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Corticosteroid injections would act as a placebo</p></blockquote>
<p>A systematic review published in <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> gathered together trials and studies on the topic and elucidated in which occasions injections are effective and when they are wrongly prescribed. The review showed that Corticosteroid injections prove to be effective in the short term, in comparison to autologous blood injection, orthotics or physiotherapy. However, in the long term, platelet-rich plasma or dry needling seem to have better results. Therefore, the Corticosteroid injections would act as a placebo. Remarkably, the effect of the steroid injections seems, therefore, minimal. Further clinical trials could provide us with a better understanding of the most effective ways of treatment for this condition.</p>

Continuation of high fossil fuel emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice.” </em></p>
<p>This may sound like the kind of call-to-arms you could have read in an editorial just yesterday, but that quote is actually from a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648">PLOS ONE paper</a> published in 2013 from noted Climate Scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen">James Hansen</a>.</p>
<p>Six years later (just this week) the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-world/">published its analysis</a> of multiple temperature data sets. In short, many areas worldwide have hit the 2 degrees Celsius warming mark that Dr. Hansen warned about. Many scientists say that is the tipping point if the planet is to avoid catastrophic and irreversible consequences.</p>
<p><strong>The message is clear: the time to act is now. </strong></p>
<p>So, what have policymakers from around the world done to forestall this growing threat to the planet that we all share? Mainly incremental steps, and in some cases, outright reversals. See <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=climate&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=7&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">here</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/climate/trump-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/climate/automakers-california-emissions-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">here,</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/climate/trump-light-bulb-rollback.html?searchResultPosition=1">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To save our planet, we need to stand up and support one another to make our voices – and the evidence of science – heard. </strong></p>
<p>PLOS stands with the young activists across the world who have taken action and organized the <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/"><strong>Global Climate Strike on September 20</strong></a>.  Their global call to action is meant to apply pressure on policymakers and drive change as world leaders  gather on September 23<sup>rd</sup> at the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/">United Nations Climate Action Summit</a>.  Thousands of scientists worldwide <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/139.2.full">have signed letters endorsing the climate strikes</a>, and we stand with them. We are giving all PLOS staff the opportunity to take the day and march to raise their voice for change.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">Multiple</a> <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/">scientific reports</a> have highlighted the disastrous effects of the climate crisis caused by manmade carbon emissions. The food we eat, the water we drink, the place we live are at great risk if we fail to act now. As their website says, “the world is on fire, let’s act like it.” We hope you stand with us.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>If you hear an unfounded statement often enough, you might just start believing that it’s true. This phenomenon, known as the “illusory truth effect”, is exploited by politicians and advertisers — and if you think you are immune to it, you’re probably wrong. In fact, earlier this year we reported on a study that found people are prone to the effect <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/26/higher-intelligence-and-an-analytical-thinking-style-offer-no-protection-against-the-illusory-truth-effect-our-tendency-to-believe-repeated-claims-are-more-likely-to-be-true/">regardless of their particular cognitive profile</a>.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing we can do to protect ourselves against the illusion. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719302276">study in <em>Cognition</em></a> has found that using our own knowledge to fact-check a false claim can prevent us from believing it is true when it is later repeated. But we might need a bit of a nudge to get there.</p>
<p><span id="more-37818"></span></p>
<p>The illusory truth effect stems from the fact that we process repeated statements more fluently: we mistake that feeling of fluency for a signal that the statement is true. And the effect occurs even when we should know better — when we repeatedly hear a statement that we know is wrong, for instance, like “The fastest land animal is the leopard”. But Nadia Brashier at Harvard University and colleagues wondered whether asking people to focus on the accuracy of a statement could encourage them to use their knowledge instead, and avoid relying on feelings of fluency.</p>
<p>In the initial study, the team first asked 103 participants to read 60 widely-known facts, some of which were true (e.g. “The Italian city known for its canals is Venice”), and some of which were false (e.g.  “The planet closest to the sun is Venus”). One group rated how interesting each statement was, while the other rated how true it was. Then in the second part of the study, both groups saw the same 60 statements along with 60 new ones — again a mixture of true and false — and rated their truthfulness.</p>
<p>The researchers found that participants who had focussed on how interesting the statements were in the first part of the study showed the illusory truth effect: they subsequently rated false statements which they had already seen as more true than false statements which were new. But the group that had initially focused on the accuracy of the statements didn’t show this effect, rating new and repeated false statements as equally true.</p>
<p>This finding suggests that using our own knowledge to critically analyse a statement when we originally encounter it may inoculate us against the illusory truth effect. And this seems to have fairly long-lasting effects: in another experiment, the team found that participants who had initially focussed on the accuracy of the statements still showed no sign of succumbing to the illusory truth effect two days later.</p>
<p>But considering the accuracy of a statement is only useful if we already have appropriate knowledge (e.g. that the closest planet to the sun is Mercury and not Venus). In further studies, the team found that rating the truthfulness of more obscure false statements which participants didn’t know much about, such as “The twenty-first U.S. president was Garfield,” didn’t later protect against the illusory truth effect. It would be interesting to know whether fact-checking against external sources like the internet or reference books — which requires more effort than simply using our own knowledge — is effective at combating the illusion in these cases.</p>
<p>Still, simply having the background knowledge needed to counter false claims is not always enough, say the authors — their results suggest people may need to be “nudged” into actually using that knowledge. “Education only offers part of the solution to the misinformation crisis; we must also prompt people to carefully compare incoming claims to what they already know,” they write.</p>

It’s no secret that retractions have a stigma, which is very likely part of why authors often resist the move — even when honest error is involved. There have been at least a few proposals to change the nomenclature for some retractions over the years, from turning them into “amendments” to a new taxonomy.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/09/Opening_Influenza_Research_hero.width-500-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>The last influenza (flu) pandemic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090612153009/http:/www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html">declared by the World Health Organization</a> was as recent as 2009. And, even though this was 10 years ago, most of us would acknowledge that flu outbreaks, and their human and economic costs, are never out of global headlines for long, and the flu takes its toll every year. In their most recent <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal)">factsheet</a> the WHO reported that: “[w]orldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths.”</p>
<p>Despite the global implications of potential epidemic, gaps still exist in our understanding of influenza which we can only begin to solve by making more of the research— including replication studies and negative results—publicly available. The <a href="https://theflulab.org/">Flu Lab</a>, the <a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> (COS) and PLOS have announced a<a href="https://cos.io/our-services/research/flulab/"> three-pronged collaboration</a> to open influenza research and help tackle this perennial and massive threat to global health. <em>PLOS ONE</em> is publishing peer-reviewed research arising from a call for proposals funded and coordinated by the Flu Lab and COS. This will form part of a special collection, alongside commentaries and perspectives published by<em> PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>.</p>
<p>The focus of these three prongs is emptying, and publishing, the “file drawer” of influenza research and doubling down on ensuring verification and reproducibility of this research, two notions that should never be in question for such a potentially devastating health risk. At PLOS we know that all science—including negative outcomes—informs the scientific record and this initiative will reduce the time and resources needed by current and future researchers to further advance the field.</p>
<p>In this collaboration, decisions on funding and publication will remain independent. All submissions to <em>PLOS ONE</em> will be peer reviewed without influence from the funding or coordinating partners. The commissioning of content by <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> will be editorially independent.</p>
<p>The full details of the initiative and call for proposals are <a href="https://cos.io/our-services/research/flulab/">here</a>, and prospective authors are invited to submit inquiries to the <a href="https://forms.gle/SHZprx4tzR6o1dpW9">inquiry form</a>. In summary, the initiative invites researchers to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empty the file-drawers of existing <u>negative and null results</u></strong><br />
Researchers often feel pressure to leave experiments showing negative or inconclusive results out of reports for concern that they decrease publishability, yet the cost of doing so undermines the overall value and credibility of the published literature. We encourage laboratories to empty their file drawers and share negative and null results to highlight their existence and facilitate understanding of research pathways that are unproductive or not yet robust for advancing influenza research.</li>
<li><strong>Empty the file drawers of existing <u>replication studies</u></strong><br />
Many laboratories conduct replication studies but do not publish them because of perceived lack of publishability. We therefore also explicitly invite replication studies and encourage comprehensive reporting of successes and failures to foster insight on the conditions under which phenomena can be observed.</li>
<li><strong>Submit proposals for new, highly-powered replications of important results in influenza research</strong><br />
Authors can propose to conduct highly-powered replications of existing influenza findings to improve credibility and verifiability of existing claims.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>PLOS ONE</em>’s rigorous methodological and ethical <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">criteria for publication</a> apply to this special collection and all <em>new </em>replications will be in the <a href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Report</a> format. As such, proposals will be reviewed <em>prior </em>to conducting the research. Successful Stage 1 peer review concludes with provisional acceptance of the research for publication, preregistration of the experiment(s) and analysis plan(s), and successful authors are eligible for up to $25,000 in awards to conduct the research and to cover any article processing charges (APCs). Stage 2 peer review begins after the research is completed and assesses only adherence to the accepted protocol and analysis plan and appropriate calibration of the conclusions.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with like-minded collaborators on such an important topic. Without the full picture of negative and null results, or replication studies, which this open science initiative will begin to provide, our knowledge is incomplete. This is a situation we cannot afford in the face of a public health threat like influenza.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"><em>“I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.”</em> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So said then-candidate Donald J Trump during a US presidential debate in 2015. Trump may have strong feelings on the matter, but he’s not alone. “Dozens of articles are written about political correctness every month in [US-based] media outlets spanning the political spectrum,” note the authors of a <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414870"><span style="color: black;">new paper</span></a></span><span class="None"> published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. However, surprisingly little psychological research has looked at the consequences of using politically incorrect versus correct language — does it make a real difference to a listener or reader’s perceptions of that person, and if so, in what way?</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-37799"></span></p>
<p>Michael Rosenblum at the University of California, Berkeley and colleagues set out to plug this gap. They defined political correctness as “the use of language or behaviour to seem sensitive to others’ feelings, especially those others who seem socially disadvantaged.” Then in a series of experiments involving a total of almost 5,000 people, the team explored  how participants perceived those who made PC and un-PC statements — and how those perceptions changed depending on the participant’s political persuasion.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In initial studies, participants read statements supposedly made by US senators. Some read a version in which PC terms were used for certain groups — “undocumented immigrants” and “people with learning disabilities”, for example — while for others the labels were switched to be un-PC (“illegals” or “mentally challenged”).</span></span></p>
<p>Overall, the team found that the authors of statements which used un-PC language were seen as being more “authentic” (and less susceptible to outside influence, in particular) but also more “cold”. Both authenticity and personal warmth are an important part of people’s assessments of politicians, the researchers note, so in the real world, perhaps this could have an impact on a senator’s popularity.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">However, whether or not a participant sympathised with the target of this language affected their ratings. When non-PC language supported more conservative attitudes — when undocumented immigrants were described as “illegals” for example — conservative participants rated the communicator as being particularly authentic, while liberal participants saw them as especially cold. But when the target group was the subject of conservatives’ sympathy — when poor white people were described as “white trash”, for instance — they rated the communicator as being particularly cold, whereas liberals gave stronger ratings for authenticity. “This pattern of results suggests that the interpretation of political language depends on the group to which it is being applied, and whether perceivers care about that group or not,” the team writes.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In a subsequent experiment, the team tried a more naturalistic context for the research. They identified a topic that had roughly equal levels of support among liberals and conservatives: the use of federal funding for historically Black churches. Pairs of participants with different views on this topic debated it in live, online, text-based conversations. In each case, one person was instructed to use politically correct or incorrect language (e.g. referring to religious individuals as either “People with sincerely held religious beliefs” or “Bible Thumpers”), while the other wrote whatever they wanted. Afterwards, the participants completed a survey that measured their impressions of each other and the conversation. The researchers found that d</span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">ebaters who used politically incorrect language came across as being less persuadable (an important aspect of authenticity) and also colder than those who were told to be PC. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">How authentic — or not — we perceive someone to be is critical in all kinds of decisions, such as whether to trust them, as well as how much we like them, the researchers note. In theory, the potential role of politically incorrect language in affecting these perceptions could be important for all sorts of social interactions.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Further research is certainly needed to explore various questions, such as how accurate people’s judgements about persuadability and coldness based on PC vs non-PC language are. Still, these experiments do suggest that un-PC language can promote <i>perceptions</i> of authenticity, especially among conservatives with the same attitudes — something that is surely already at least implicitly recognised by President Trump.</span></span></p>

There was no difference between genders for the magnitude of this cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Patricia Hirsch adds: “The present findings strongly suggest that there are no substantial gender differences in multitasking performance across task-switching and dual-task paradigms, which predominantly measure cognitive control mechanisms such as working memory updating, the engagement and disengagement of task sets, and inhibition.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe air pollution may contribute to higher rates of psychiatric disorders, according to new research from PLOS Biology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many different types of factors may contribute to the likelihood of developing mental illness, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the authors of this study found that poor air quality was associated with higher rates of bipolar disorder and major depression in both US and Danish populations. This trend was especially stark in the Denmark population studied, where exposure to polluted air during the first ten years of childhood predicted a more than two-fold increase in schizophrenia and personality disorders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Atif Khan says: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our study shows that living in polluted areas, especially early on in life, is predictive of mental disorders in both the United States and Denmark…the physical environment – in particular air quality – warrants more research to better understand how our environment is contributing to neurological and psychiatric disorders.” </span></p>

<p><strong>Can psychology help us become more creative? </strong>Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a> learns how <span>we can develop our </span><span>creativity with practice, and discovers that our best “Eureka” moments often come when we step away from the task at hand. She also investigates how members of the public fare with the riddles psychologists use to study creative problem solving — see how you get on at home.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Berlin-header-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I took over <a href="https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiLKkzemx5AIVWeDtCh3ZXwCgEAAYASAAEgJNRvD_BwE?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Palliative Care</em></a> as Editor just the month before the congress and have been particularly excited to network and meet clinicians, caregivers, researchers, volunteers, patient advocates, and educators in this field. After hearing so many positive things about the Palliative Care community I was enthusiastic to learn more about how palliative care fits in the current global health agenda.</p>
<p>The increasing recognition of the importance of palliative care in society is reflected by the growing number of EAPC congress delegates each year, with this year’s event reaching an attendance of 3,000. Among them, particularly the Australian and New Zealand delegates filled the rooms with positivity and even managed to encourage the whole audience to join in their chanting in one of the keynote talks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“When you are well, you belong to yourself, but when you are sick, you belong to your family.”</em></strong><strong> – Rwandan saying</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the opening ceremony, Prof. Phil Larkin, president of the EAPC, introduced a strong and clear statement – ‘Palliative Care must be part of the global health agenda’, followed by a heartwarming opening concert session performed by the German band ‘Nordlichter’. Welcome to Berlin!</p>
<p>Dr. Sèbastiene Moine, chair of the scientific committee of the EAPC World Congress, reminded us all that five years since the adaption of the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA67/A67_R19-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution on Palliative Care by the World Health Assembly</a>, the EAPC World Congress in Berlin is perfectly timed. The upcoming days will give us the chance to reflect the progress in the global development of palliative care. For a better integration in care Dr. Moine presented an upgrade version of the ‘<a href="https://www.eapcnet.eu/eapc-groups/reference/primary-care" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EAPC Primary Palliative Care Toolkit</a>’ endorsed by WONCA, the World Organization of Family Doctors,  with the words: ’Here is to hoping for the dissemination of the palliative care approach into primary care!’.</p>

<p>The World Congress participants had the chance to take part in various stimulating meeting tracks, seminars, discussion forums, and poster sessions. It was often hard to pick the next one to go to with many interesting sessions and topics in parallel. Fortunately, I managed to attend interesting sessions which all touched the latest challenges in the field, e.g. an increased request of palliative care for prison inmates, the different models and policies of physician assisted dying around the world and palliative care plans for mentally ill patients.</p>
<p><strong>Plenary talks – Is Palliative Care biased?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“It has been easier since Jack died (…) I neglected my own health.”</em></strong><strong> – Female caregiver</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The choice of invited speakers was positively excellent; the plenary talks were thought-provoking and motivating. Yet, Prof. Merryn Gott’s presentation, Dr. Katherine Sleeman’s provoking keynote, and Dr. Ntizimira’s journey stood out and persisted in the audience’s mind for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/m-gott" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Professor Gott (University Auckland)</a> raised the question if palliative care is gender-biased. She created awareness for a large group of unnoticed women who feel obliged to care for their husbands at home, outside of the radar of hospitals, doctors, hospices, or any help. As a wife, they feel bound by marriage to take care ‘until the end’ and urgently need to be more supported in their burden, physically and mentally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/cicelysaunders/about/people/academic/sleemank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Sleeman (Kings College London, UK)</a> strongly reminded us of the importance of well-designed studies and valid research questions to stop the influx of low quality data and to avoid ‘research waste’ that could limit the resources of reviewers and publishers. She highly encouraged us all to increase the value of research, connect and cooperate, and work closely with stake holders to promote the transition from published research to desperately needed real world policies. She did well to remind us all that our mission does not end with our published articles.</p>
<p>Dr. Ntizimira’s presentation on ‘<a href="https://borgenproject.org/palliative-care-for-rohingya-refugees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Palliative care for Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar (Bangladesh)</em></a>’ took us all on a challenging journey and raised awareness for a very vulnerable population. Once again, adequate access to an early, coordinated and continuous palliative care is desperately needed around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Global Challenges in Pediatric Palliative Care</strong></p>
<p>Children’s palliative care is an emerging field with many similarities to adult palliative care but also distinct differences. In Berlin, the EAPC hosted for the very first time, a dedicated pediatric palliative care seminar in the Europe Hall on Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup> May. The committee managed to compile an interesting program on the latest clinical, ethical and political issues inviting experts in the field. I had the chance to attend the last session on’ Challenges on pediatric palliative care’ and still have goose bumps when I think about it.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We do as much as we can, as well as we can, for as long as we can, for as many as we can.”</em></strong><strong> – Written note at hospice in Uganda</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast to my initial assumptions, the pediatric group most affected in palliative care is children between 0-1 years old. <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/a.a.e.verhagen/research" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Eduard Verhagen (University of Groningen)</a> provided insights into the challenges and tools that help parents to make informed decisions during what is likely the most painful time of their lives. <a href="http://merimna.org.gr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Curriculum-Vitae-2018-DANAI-PAPADATOU-2-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B8%CE%AE-%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%86%CE%AE-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-site.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Danai Papadatou (Director of Psychology, University of Athens, Greece)</a> is one of the most popular personas in the field. Her use of theories, concepts, history, and models are well-known and delightful. She manages to convey complex ideas in a manner that is accessible to all and took us on her journey of accompanying children at end of life. She later gave another insightful plenary talk on her work with minor refugees that she has visited in camps throughout Southern Europe in the past years.</p>
<p><strong>EAPC meets ESMO: Integration of Oncology and Palliative Care</strong></p>
<p>The Lancet Oncology commissioned article (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30061-5/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kaasa <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>) and the ESMO (European Society of Medical Oncology) position paper on <em>Supportive and palliative care</em> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/29/7/1494/5001430" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jordan <em>et al.</em>, Annals of Oncology 2017</a>) delivered the ideal basis to discuss the growing challenges and interfaces in the area of integration of oncology and palliative care. Delegates were warmly welcome to attend the full day EAPC – ESMO Seminar in the Europe Hall on Friday 24<sup>th</sup> May. As Editor of <em>BMC Cancer</em> and <em>BMC Palliative Care,</em> I was particularly interested in the <a href="https://www.eapc-2019.org/files/EAPC19/dl/05_EAPC_ESMO%20Joint%20Symposium%20Integration%20of%20Oncology.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">special track</a>.</p>
<p>The committee invited great panels and speakers that triggered critical and fruitful discussions on current challenges, latest developments and the place of death. However, there is still so much we need to do to unite the clinical and traditionally grown cancer-focused treatment approaches with early palliative care plans to serve the most important part: the cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p><strong>EAPC Congress ePosters – a complete success</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11252" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11252" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/20190523_141713-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EAPC ePoster – a valued approach</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Linda Gummlich</div></figure>
<p>EAPC organizers helped to overcome the well-known conference struggles like presentation scheduling conflicts by installing 3 large monitors and a platform that run all posters as electronic posters throughout the congress. Attendees were able to search via topic, title or author. One even had the feature to email posters – those which received consent by the authors – to attendees to view later. The delegates valued the approach, and the ePoster platform will be part of future EAPC conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Poster Award and EAPC Research Paper of the year 2018</strong></p>
<p>During the final ceremony session Dr. Natalia Arias-Casais’ poster presentation on ‘<a href="https://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(19)30229-5/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Consensus building on health indicators to access palliative care global development with an international group of experts</em></a>’ has been awarded as best reflecting the congress theme. There was a standing ovation when <a href="https://www.eupca.eu/daniel-gainza-miranda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Gainz-Miranda</a> and his colleagues from SERMAS (Palliative Home Care Team, North Madrid, Spain) were announced as <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jpm.2018.0363?utm_source=sfmc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=JPM+FP+May24+2019&amp;d=5%2F24%2F2019&amp;mcid=742322401&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EAPC Research Article of the Year 2018</a> winners. Many congratulations to both research teams, well deserved.</p>
<p><strong>Photo competition, interactive wall and unique conference bags</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11257" style="width: 700px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11257" height="244" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Wall-and-photocompetition-1-300x106.jpg" width="690" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Interactive conference features: ‘Before I die…’ wall and palliative care photo competition.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Linda Gummlich</div></figure>
<p>The congress committee provided the delegates with some unique meeting features. Participants were invited to take breaks, slow down, and review their own thoughts on dying and palliative care at different areas of the conference site. We were encouraged to write down our dreams and life goals on the ‘<em>Before I die….</em>’ wall. The attempt was more or less taken seriously, and the frequently changing additions helped to put a smile on the face of many passersby – with the most popular ones even hitting the conference’s twitter feeds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the hallway we had the chance to vote on our favorites for the photo competition. Deciding was difficult, with various intimate and touching pictures, yet not too cliché for the field. I am secretly pleased to report one of my favorites won the photo competition award. Congratulations!</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11259" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11259" height="219" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Conference-bags-300x219.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Unique handmade EAPC conference bags.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Linda Gummlich</div></figure>
<p>One of the most wanted items at the meeting were the unique conference bags. EAPC supported the <a href="https://kawempehomecare.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kawempe Home Care (KHC)</a>, a private not-for-profit, community organization in Uganda and ordered thousands of handmade meeting bags for all the delegates. Each bag was more beautiful than the other and it was hard to spot duplicates throughout the meeting. With the bags being long-lasting, sustainable, and thoughtful, people queued at the very last day to grab leftover bags and seconds for friends and families at home. I fell in love with my bag and will keep it. It has been a gentle reminder of the topics I heard and the conversations I had ever since.</p>
<p>EAPC 2019 it has been a pleasure, I am looking forward to seeing everyone again at <a href="https://eapcresearchcongress2020.eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EAPC 2020 in Palermo</a>, Italy, next year.</p>

A paper about electrical activity in cultured human brain cells got a lot of attention this week:



Scientists Just Detected Brain Waves in Mini Lab-Grown Brains



Mini-brains grown in a lab show neural activity like preterm babies



The study, published in Cell Stem Cell, was about cortical organoids, three dimensional blobs of brain-like tissue that are created from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).







Researchers Trujillo et al. recorded electrical activity from the organoids as

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Turn on the news tonight and you’ll be bombarded with gloomy stories. You’ll hear about disasters and human suffering, political scandals and environmental destruction. Maybe there will be some good news sandwiched in there — a piece on an exciting new scientific discovery, perhaps, or a profile of a talented young musician. But overall, news coverage is predominantly negative.</p>
<p>Why is that the case? Ultimately, of course, journalists decide what stories and issues receive coverage. But they are also catering to the demands of their audience — and it seems that we respond most to negative stories.</p>
<p>But not all of us. A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/08/27/1908369116">recent international study in <em>PNAS</em></a> looking at people’s physiological responses to news reports has found that <em>overall</em> we do seem to have greater reactions to negative stories. However, there is so much variation in how different people respond, say the researchers, that there may be a bigger market for positive stories than journalists often realise.</p>

<p>Previous studies into people’s “negativity bias” when consuming media have largely focussed on Anglo-American participants. So Stuart Soroka from the University of Michigan and colleagues set about investigating whether this bias was a universal phenomenon, or specific to certain cultures.</p>
<p>The team recruited 1,156 participants from 17 countries around the world — from Ghana to Sweden to Chile — to watch a series of BBC News stories. Each participant saw five international clips consisting of a mixture of positive news (e.g. a report on a zoo releasing gorillas back into the wild) and negative news (e.g. a clip on a UN war crimes investigation). Participants also saw one positive and one negative news story local to their country (my personal favourite was a good news story seen by New Zealand participants about a local group that teaches dogs to drive).</p>
<p>The researchers also measured participants’ heart rate variability and skin conductance while they watched the clips. These physiological measures are related to arousal and attentiveness, and can provide a record of people’s reactions in real time, without them needing to make any conscious response.</p>
<p>Overall, heart rate variability and skin conductance were greater when participants were watching the negative clips than when they were watching the positive ones. This suggests that the negativity bias is a global phenomenon, say the authors. “This study directly demonstrates that humans around the world are more activated by negative news coverage,” they write. “We are, perhaps, one step closer to accounting for the high frequency of negative news content around the world.”</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the whole story. From this data, the researchers then modelled how each individual’s heart rate variability and skin conductance would change as a clip became more negative in tone. While these physiological measures increased for the majority of people, there was a huge amount of variation — many participants actually showed no change or a decreased response. The differences between participants didn’t seem to strongly relate to the country they lived in, suggesting that they couldn’t simply be explained by cultural factors.</p>
<p>These results suggest that if the media want to attract audiences, they don’t necessarily need to only show negative content, say the authors.  “Even as the average tendency may be for viewers to be more attentive to and aroused by negative content, there would appear to be a good number of individuals with rather different or perhaps more mutable preferences,” they write.</p>
<p>Of course, physiological recordings are just one way of measuring how engaged someone is, and it would be interesting to see if the results line up with more explicit measures of engagement with the news, such as surveys or interviews about people’s preferences. Still, it seems as good a time as any to inject a bit more positivity into our news coverage.</p>

<p>Extraversion, thy name is Katie. And Jack. And Carter. But not, it turns out, Joanna, Owen, or Lauren: these individuals instead embody different traits, like emotionality and agreeableness.</p>
<p>At least, that’s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-43758-001">how people rated the personalities of those names</a> in a recent paper published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>. According to the study, we associate the sounds in names with certain traits: names containing <em>k</em> and <em>t</em> sounds are judged as having quite different profiles than those with the more resonant <em>n</em> or <em>l</em> sounds. It will come as no surprise, however, that in the real world Katies are not actually any more likely to be extraverted than Laurens. <span id="more-37747"></span></p>
<p>Past studies have found that people tend to associate particular sounds with certain shapes: the word “bouba” with a round shape and “kiki” with a spiky one, for example. And we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/">may also instinctively associate shapes and sounds with particular emotional states</a>.</p>
<p>But David Sidhu and colleagues at the University of Calgary were interested in whether people relate sounds to more abstract concepts, like personalities. In particular, the team wanted to know whether we judge people’s personalities differently depending on whether their names contain “sonorants” — resonant or nasal sounds like <em>m</em>, <em>l</em> and <em>n</em> — or “voiceless stops” — short sounds that are formed by blocking air flow in the vocal tract, such as <em>t</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Across three studies, the team showed a total of 180 participants a series of traits that reflect different aspects of personality like conscientiousness (e.g. “hard-working”) or extraversion (e.g. “social”). At the same time, they displayed names that contained either sonorants (e.g. “Lauren”) or voiceless stops (e.g. “Katie”).</p>
<p>In one study, participants saw a pair of names, and had to pick which one best matched a given trait, while in another they saw a single name, and had to rate how well the trait described that person. In a third study, participants rated the personalities of made-up names with similar sounds: “Mauren” instead of Lauren; “Tatie” instead of Katie.</p>
<p>In all three studies, participants rated sonorant names like Lauren higher on agreeableness, and in two of the studies they also rated them higher in emotionality and conscientiousness. In contrast, voiceless stop names like Katie were rated higher in extraversion.</p>
<p>Why would people rate certain names as being more extraverted or more agreeable? Perhaps, reasoned the researchers, in the real world people’s names truly do reflect their personalities. So in another study, they asked more than 1,000 participants to complete online personality surveys — but found no real evidence for a link between the participants’ personalities and the sounds in their own names.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that people have already made associations between particular names and traits: perhaps they have a particularly agreeable friend called Lauren, for example. But the fact that the researchers saw the same effects even for made-up names suggests that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the researchers suggest, <span>we may have learned to associate certain sounds with particular emotional contexts. For example, people may tend to use softer, sonorant sounds in calmer situations, and so we perceive those with sonorant sounds in their names — the Laurens and the Owens — as more agreeable and conscientious. Alternatively, the relationship between sound and personality could be more metaphorical: the short abrupt sounds in “Jack” and “Katie”, for instance, might bring to mind the quick, bouncy energy of someone with a more extraverted personality. </span></p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it seems unlikely that the information gleaned from the sounds in a name will have much impact on how we judge a person in the real world, where we usually have a lot of other information about them. But knowing how a sound brings to mind other characteristics could be useful in some situations. A company naming its product probably should consider whether the sounds in the name will affect people’s perceptions, suggest the researchers, while an author might want to give their protagonist a name that fits their personality.</p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">How do you persuade people to do the “right thing” when there’s a personal price to pay? What convinces someone to spend time and effort on a task like recycling batteries, for example — or literally spend cash by giving to people in desperate need?</span></p>
<p>It’s an important question. “Finding mechanisms to promote pro-social behaviour is fundamental for the wellbeing of our societies and is more urgent than ever in a time of key global challenges such as resource conservation, climate change and social inequalities,” write the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48094-4">new paper</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Across a series of five online studies involving a total of more than 3,000 participants, Valerio Capraro at Middlesex University of London and colleagues provide evidence for a cheap, effective method: simply “nudging” people to reflect on what is the morally right thing to do. This simple intervention had some impressive effects, even increasing actual charitable donations by close to half.</p>
<p><span id="more-37738"></span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The first study involved a simple test of altruistic behaviour. The researchers gave US-based participants 20 cents each and told them they were paired with someone else who had nothing. Right before being told that they could donate any part of that 20 cent pot to their (fictional) partner, one group was asked, “What do you personally think is the morally right thing to do in this situation?” Another was asked, “What do you think your society considers to be the morally right thing to do in this situation?” The third was simply asked how much they wanted to donate. This group donated, on average, 21.2% of their money, while members of both the ‘moral nudge’ groups donated an average of 30.6%. (Statistically, both nudges were equally effective.)</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In further studies, the team found that the effect of giving moral nudges in this altruism task also “spilled over” to increase later cooperative behaviour, explored using an economic version of the classic <a href="https://policonomics.com/lp-game-theory2-prisoners-dilemma/"><span class="Hyperlink0">prisoner’s dilemma</span></a> game. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">For the final study, 1,662 participants were given 50 cents and asked if they wanted to donate all or part to either <em>Emergency</em>, a humanitarian NGO that provides emergency medical treatment to victims of war, or <em>Give for France</em>, an organisation supporting victims of the July 14, 2016 Nice terrorist attack. (These experiments were conducted within a few days of this attack.) Morally-nudged participants gave 47% more to <em>Give for France</em>, and 39% more to <em>Emergency, </em>than those who hadn’t been given a moral prompt.</span></p>
<p>Strikingly, this combined average increase in actual charitable donations of 44% is very similar to the 47% increase observed when people who donated to a fund-raiser were <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/121/2/747/1884044?redirectedFrom=fulltext">entered into a lottery to win a cash prize</a>. “Moral nudges produce…essentially the same increase but are free of cost,” Capraro and his colleagues note.</p>
<p>The researchers argue that their results could potentially influence policy aimed at increasing pro-social behaviour. However, as they also note, it’s early days for this research, and there are still questions. Would moral nudges increase pro-social behaviour in other spheres of life, beyond small-scale crowdsourced charitable giving? And what underpins the increase in pro-social behaviour: did the moral nudges work because participants sincerely wanted to do the morally right thing, or because they felt that such behaviour was appropriate in the context of these experiments?</p>
<p>The approach certainly seems promising. Now, <span>the team writes, </span><span>“future research should explore potential generalisations, with a particular focus to larger stakes, longer time spans and a greater number of interactions.”</span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Entering into a new intimate relationship can feel exciting and full of possibility. And for many, it may seem to offer the chance to escape the patterns of our previous relationships: perhaps there will be less arguing, or maybe the new relationship will provide a greater sense of satisfaction. But a recent study suggests that once the initial honeymoon period is over, the dynamics of a new relationship may end up being pretty similar to the last one.</p>
<p><span id="more-37732"></span></p>
<p>To examine the kinds of changes that occur when people move from one partner to the next, Matthew Johnson from the University of Alberta and Franz Neyer from Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena examined data from the German Family Panel, a longitudinal study that has been following more than 12,000 people since 2008. Each year, participants complete a survey that includes rating their relationship and sexual satisfaction, frequency of sex, relationship stability, and how much they quarrel with their partner or receive admiration from them.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000523">their new paper</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Family Psychology</em>, the team analysed the responses of 554 participants who had had two intimate relationships which had both lasted long enough to be recorded in two surveys. This provided the team with data from the second-to-last and final year of one relationship, and the first and second year of the subsequent relationship. By comparing the levels of satisfaction, instability and so on at these different stages, they could see how dynamics changed across relationships.</p>
<p>The pair found that at the end of the first relationship, all of the measures deteriorated: people became less satisfied, argued more and so on. Unsurprisingly, these measures then all improved when they began seeing their next partner. A year later, however, they dropped again — the “honeymoon” period had worn off.</p>
<p>But when the researchers compared the first survey of the first relationship and the second survey of the second relationship — that is, the most stable phases in the partnerships — the responses were pretty similar. There were no significant differences in sexual or relationship satisfaction, in the amount of conflict, or in perceptions of stability. Only two measures differed: overall, participants had more sex and received more admiration from their partner in the second relationship.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that our intimate partnerships end up quite similar to the ones that came before them. We may feel like a new partnership is different or better, the researchers say, because the conflict and negative feelings that characterise the end of a previous relationship “cast a long shadow over the memory of that union”.</p>
<p>However, a lack of evidence for differences between relationships doesn’t necessarily mean that such changes don’t occur. Of particular concern is that the study used very basic survey measures: most involved just one or two questions (e.g. “All in all, how satisfied are you with your relationship?”), so may not have been sensitive to more subtle changes in dynamics.</p>
<p>And, as the researchers point out, even if <em>on average</em> people don’t see many differences between their relationships, there might be certain individual characteristics that make changes more or less likely. For instance, the team found that participants’ level of neuroticism and relationship length both influenced the pattern of results. “Changes did occur for some people,” they conclude, “but despite the presence of a new partner, change is not inevitable.”</p>

Having an MRI scan can be a noisy, unusual, and sometimes stressful experience. But can it also be a social one?







In a new paper, neuroscientists Benjamin O. Turner and colleagues ask whether telling people that their MRI scan will be a "mind reading" procedure is enough to alter brain activity through 'implied social presence'. As the authors put it:



If people believe that a technology can ‘see’ their internal thoughts, will people alter what they think about?

Despite being fairly common, there are often misconceptions that the condition may be contagious and is known to affect people’s self-esteem.  Since the condition is chronic, this can negatively impact the mental health of people experiencing the condition. The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) <a href="https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes that</a> depression is the number one comorbidity of psoriasis. People with psoriasis are <a href="https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twice as likely to become depressed</a> as the rest of the population.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In popular culture, businesswoman and television personality, Kim Kardashian, has recently announced she experiences the condition. Given Kardashian’s huge social media following, it is possible that this could help to bring awareness to the condition and comfort and understanding to those who also experience psoriasis.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) <a href="https://www.psoriasis.org/life-with-psoriasis/depression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes that</a> depression is the number one co-morbidity of psoriasis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although psoriasis is common, the condition is under-researched. The underlying cause of psoriasis is thought to be our immune system unnecessarily accelerating the growth of skin cells resulting in inflammation. It is thought that combinations of genes as well as exposure to particular external factors are likely to trigger development of the condition. Scientists have now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751129/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identified about 25 genetic variants,</a> which increase the probability of a person developing psoriasis. The most common form of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis, is thought to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3376640/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caused by a rare genetic mutation</a> known as CARD14. Stress, weather changes, medications, infections, skin trauma, smoking and alcohol are all thought to flare up the condition. Most people experience small lesions, however, severity varies on a case-by-case basis. The condition is split into six main types; plaque psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, psoriasis in sensitive areas and nail psoriasis (summarized in table 1).</p>

<p><strong>Table 1: </strong>Summary of the different types of psoriasis</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Despite being fairly common, there are often misconceptions that the condition may be contagious and is known to affect people’s self-esteem.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The severity of the condition is assessed by the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scale, which is a 6-point, 0-5 measure of psoriasis based on different symptoms, across the whole body. It is used to standardize the diagnosis of psoriasis, particularly in clinical trials.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcdermatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12895-019-0088-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A recent article</a> published in <em>BMC Dermatology</em> collected data from 3641 patients suffering with moderate, severe and chronic psoriasis. A version of the PGA scale was applied to participants in a clinical trial setting, to test its validity. The study provided an ‘intensive and rigorous’ analysis of the scoring matrix. It concluded that the scale is reliable to obtain a global assessment on the severity of psoriasis, further validating the three-item PGA tool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What treatments are available? </strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no permanent treatment available for psoriasis. Initially, treatment often involves topical creams applied to the skin to help relieve the symptoms of the condition. Treatments vary on the type and severity of psoriasis.</p>
<p>Scientists are working on new treatments for the management of the condition. This includes the use of a therapeutic antibody, or monoclonal antibody, called Secukinumab. Two proteins involved in human immune responses, Interleukins 12 and 23, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17706835" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been suggested</a> to play a role in the development of psoriasis. Therefore, researchers have developed a human monoclonal antibody to disable these proteins.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcdermatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12895-019-0087-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study protocol</a> recently published in <em>BMC Dermatology</em> lays out the plans to assess the real world safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in the management of moderate to severe psoriasis through a multinational study. Previous controlled clinical trials have shown secukinumab to be safe and effective and the results of this up-and-coming trial hope to highlight the real world, long term benefits of secukinumab, in turn improving quality of life in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/08/29/our-moderation-process/">Our Moderation Process</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is an important component of scholarly communication among its communities. The readers and authors of arXiv expect to find articles that advance their scientific understanding and pique ideas and discussions, and so arXiv maintains that expectation and trust with assistance from its moderation process. The arXiv moderation process strives to rapidly disseminate research while meeting content and technical standards.  Each paper that an author submits is subject to this process, which checks that submissions are relevant to the scientific community and follow arXiv policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, on average, over 10,000 articles were submitted to one of the 8 scientific categories and their 149 total sub-categories within arXiv each month. This means that every day 600-800 articles are submitted by authors who expect that their article will be posted in the next announcement. We manage this volume with a team of arXiv administrators and volunteer moderators who work together to verify that submissions meet our technical requirements and content policies. </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is our moderation process?</span></h1>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_488" style="width: 600px;"><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/08/Moderation-Process-visual.jpg"><img alt="Moderation illustrated as a net or web for submissions to pass through to being a posted arXiv paper" class="wp-image-488 size-full" height="338" id="longdesc-return-488" longdesc="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv?longdesc=488&amp;referrer=486" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2019/08/Moderation-Process-visual.jpg" tabindex="-1" width="600" /></a>The moderation process serves as a net to capture submissions for review of category assignment, technical requirements, and appropriate content before being posted to arXiv.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv administrators, consisting of a small team of staff and students, work with 170+ volunteer moderators to review the classification, metadata, and content of all submissions. The team performs checks with software support to confirm that the submission is classified to the appropriate subject category, that it is in compliance with our technical requirements, including formatting and metadata information, and that the content is appropriate, which, generally, describes content that would be refereeable by a conventional journal and in the format of a research article. Our arXiv administrators and volunteer moderators work together to review submissions and resolve any issues to move the submission to announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arXiv moderation process is not a peer-review process. arXiv staff and moderators do not evaluate the validity of the scientific process and cannot give feedback on the submission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv administrators and moderators work under the guidance and policies set by the arXiv Scientific Director, with advice from our Scientific Advisory Board and the Subject Advisory Committees. The Chair of the Subject Advisory Committees and Scientific Director help administrators and moderators resolve questions and issues when requested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 15% of daily submissions are flagged for additional actions or review. Submissions that were not flagged for review or were resolved before the deadline are posted to the next announcement. Our goal is to resolve issues within 24 hours, but some decisions require more time; thus, the submission is placed on hold until a decision can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we balance our goals of rapid distribution with our moderation standards, sometimes content gets posted that maybe should not have been accepted. As arXiv is a permanent repository, these submissions cannot be removed after they are posted. Only in cases where the submitter did not have the legal right to submit content to arXiv do we consider removal.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are our moderators?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderators are volunteers from around the world who have been successfully selected by the Subject Advisory Committee, based on their expertise in their professional fields and in their subject classifications. Our moderators evaluate submissions based on the content and the policies of arXiv, and work with the arXiv administrative staff. They are each responsible for the submissions to their assigned sub-category, and work, ideally, with at least one other moderator. Although, some categories have only one moderator. Moderators generally spend less than 30 mins each day resolving flagged submissions before the day’s deadline, which is 14:00 Eastern Time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We depend on our moderators. They keep arXiv relevant and of interest to professional researchers– we could not do it without them! Like many organizations that rely on devoted individuals contributing their time and effort, we could not provide the service the arXiv community expects without their dedicated volunteer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, moderators!</span></p>

<p>Worldwide, many childbearing women have <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959-353505054718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">little opportunity</a> to make autonomous childbirth decisions themselves and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AMR51/007/2010/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experience</a> <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/10/07/no-tally-anguish/accountability-maternal-health-care-india" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poor</a> <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-5-140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">care</a>. This relates to the general status of women in society, and more specifically to the failure of maternity services to produce optimal and dignified care for all. The latter is an issue <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001847" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported in</a> high-income countries as well as low- and middle-income countries, <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including</a> <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-13-166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers are the vital link between evidence-based policies and women receiving high-quality respectful maternity care. <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-015-0117-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Explanations</a> in the literature for suboptimal care often include poor working conditions for staff and a lack of essential supplies. <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/134588/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf;jsessionid=F37EF1B2368143CB93A6557A92CF6F3C?sequence=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Other</a> <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explanations</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519212000352?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggest</a> that doctors, midwives and care assistants might lack vital skills or be unaware of the rights of the women for whom they care.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2420-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our study</a> examined the everyday lives of maternal healthcare providers working in a tertiary maternity hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, between 2010 and 2012. The aim was to understand the staff’s notions of care, their varying levels of commitment to providing care for women in childbirth, and the obstacles and dilemmas that affected standards, and thereby gain insight into their contributions to respectful maternity care, whether as ‘villains’ or as ‘victims.’</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11230" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11230 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Busy-Kabul-street-1-300x225.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">credit: author</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We employed an ethnographic approach to qualitatively explore the culture of care. Dr. Arnold spent six weeks observing care and interacting with staff. She then conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with doctors, midwives and care assistants, as well as 41 background interviews. In addition, focus groups were held with two diverse groups of women in community settings to understand their experiences and how they wished to be cared for.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>The key findings of this paper are that women related many instances of neglect, verbal abuse and demands for bribes from staff. Doctors and midwives concurred that they did not provide care as they had been taught and blamed the workload, lack of a shift system, insufficient supplies, and inadequate support from management. Closer inspection revealed a complex reality where care was impeded by low levels of supplies and medicines, caused by supply shortages and further reduced by theft; where some staff were unfairly blamed by management but others flouted rules with impunity; and where motivated staff tried hard to work well but, when overwhelmed with the workload, admitted that they lost patience and shouted at women in childbirth. In addition, there were extreme examples of both abusive and vulnerable staff.</p>
<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>We conclude that providing respectful, quality maternity care for women in Afghanistan requires multifaceted initiatives because the factors leading to suboptimal care or mistreatment are complex and interrelated. Standards need to be enforced and abusive practices need to be confronted in order to provide a supportive, facilitating environment for both staff and birthing women. Polarized perspectives such as ‘villain’ or ‘victim’ are unhelpful as they exclude the complex realities of human behavior and consequently limit the scope of problem solving.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Researchers have long known that people who are more extraverted tend to be happier, leading some to suggest that encouraging extraverted behaviour could improve wellbeing. Last year <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/">we reported on the first trial</a> of such an intervention, which found that acting like an extravert for a week led to an increase in positive emotions in certain people. Now a second study appears to have replicated that result — and shown that behaving like an introvert may also <em>reduce </em>wellbeing.</p>
<p><span id="more-37708"></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000668">the new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, </em>Seth Margolis and Sonja Lyubomirsky at the University of California, Riverside, asked 131 participants to alter their behaviour over a two week period to be more extraverted or introverted. For one week, participants were encouraged to act as “talkative”, “assertive” and “spontaneous” as possible; for the other, they were told to act “deliberate”, “quiet” and “reserved” (all participants completed both weeks, but half began with the extraverted week while the others began with with the introverted week).<span> </span></p>
<p><span>To encourage the participants to actually alter their behaviour, the researchers asked them to list five specific changes they planned on making, and then sent them periodic reminders of their task throughout the study.  A</span><span>t various points across the two weeks, the participants </span><span>completed scales measuring their experience of positive and negative emotions and others aspects of wellbeing, as well as their personality traits.</span></p>
<p>Compared to baseline levels at the start of the study, participants experienced more positive emotions during the extraverted week — and also showed reduced positive emotions during the introverted week. Some other measures of wellbeing, such as feelings of connectedness and flow (the experience of being immersed in — and enjoying — an activity) were also boosted by acting extraverted and reduced by acting introverted.</p>
<p>However, these results didn’t hold for all measures of wellbeing. For instance, participants seemed to have reduced negative emotions compared to baseline during both interventions (although the exact pattern of results differed depending on whether participants began with the extraverted or introverted week).</p>
<p>The results add to the small, albeit growing, body of evidence that acting like an extravert can improve certain aspects of wellbeing — particularly measures of positive emotion. But the authors suggest that their biggest contribution is to show that acting like an introvert can also have an effect. “Given that introversion is generally not regarded as desirable or advantageous in U.S. culture … we believe our most compelling results are those showing that well-being decreases can be substantial when people act more introverted than usual,” they write.</p>
<p>Still, it seems too soon to suggest that we should we all begin behaving like extraverts. The <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8ze6w/">study </a>the Digest <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/">reported on</a> last year found that people who had high trait levels of introversion didn’t report the same benefits of acting like an extravert as the rest of the participants, and actually became more fatigued and experienced more negative emotions. On the other hand, the new paper found that baseline levels of extraversion and introversion didn’t affect the results – but it’s still clear that researchers need a better understanding of how individual differences could influence the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>
<p>And it will also be important to figure out which behaviours are actually causing the increases or decreases in wellbeing reported in these studies. It’s not yet clear whether it was being more “talkative”, “assertive”, or “spontaneous” that resulted in an increase in wellbeing in the extraverted week, for instance, and the researchers suggest examining changes in a more specific sub-set of extraverted behaviours in the future. “We hope that research from our and others’ laboratories encourages future investigators to test the potential of behavioral interventions to spur both personality change and well-being gains,” they conclude.</p>

Stop by booth B550 to say hello. Dr. Bando is also attending ESC. Below is a brief, unedited interview with her. </em></h5>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I am senior lecturer &amp; PI who works at Cardiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. Targeting translational science in cardiovascular medicine, our team is enjoying and struggling with basic and clinical research.  Also, I am committee member of Japanese Circulation Society and International Society of Heart Research etc and dedicate myself to facilitating diversity and inclusion activities to share opportunity and social networking.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long have you been an academic editor for PLOS?</strong></p>
<p>Six years, indeed. Time flies so fast!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your specific area of study and why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>My primary expertise is diabetic cardiomyopathy and diastolic heart failure at benchside. Recently, due to growing needs at bedside, we generate new team that focuses clinical research regarding onco-cardiology (cardio-oncology in US). Interestingly, I have noticed that my research experience on diabetic cardiomyopathy does seem to be applicable for those onco-cardiology.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What first drew you into the field?</strong></p>
<p>When I was medical student, I had started my scientific experience to explore the regulatory role of protein kinase C in calponin, a calcium-regulatory protein in smooth muscle contraction. That was pretty good start and this experience attracted me so much and I decide to dive deeply into basic science.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there any trends in your field right now?</strong></p>
<p>Metabolic remodeling and the role of mitochondria. Mitochondria is a mystery and gem of cardiovascular research.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?</strong></p>
<p>Because open science contributes to enhance data reliability, feasibility, and popularity. Fortunately, the modern era of digital and network facilitates open science in easier and faster way.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most looking forward to at ESC this year?</strong></p>
<p>Late breaking clinical science (Hot line). Plus, visit Foujita chapel at Reims, if I may have any chance to make small trip.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Picture yourself sitting in a Zen garden, surrounded by low, rounded bushes and gravel raked into rippling swirls. Now imagine standing in front of a brutalist building, all straight lines and sharp edges. If you think you’d feel more relaxed in the Zen garden, there could be a low-level perceptual reason — one that could explain everything from why you’re far more likely to find a jagged script on the cover of a death metal album than on a romance novel, to why clouds and lullabies seem to go together.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0513"><span class="Hyperlink0"><span style="color: black;">new study</span></span></a><span class="None">, published in <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>, suggests that we automatically associate variations in one particular property of images or sounds with variations in levels of emotional arousal. This gives us an instinctive understanding, just from the tone of someone’s voice or watching their movements, of whether they are angry or sad, excited or calm. But it seems that these associations between perception and emotion are so automatic and fundamental that we apply them to inanimate objects, as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-37691"></span></p>
<p>Beau Sievers at Harvard University and colleagues ran a series of five studies designed to explore this property, known as the “spectral centroid”. Images and sounds can be decomposed into a spectrum that contains many components of different frequencies. Those components will differ depending on the shape or sound: a smooth curve, for example, is made up of lower frequencies than a shape with lots of straight lines and corners. The spectral centroid (SC) is essentially the average of this frequency spectrum. Sievers’ team wanted to know whether this property was related to levels of emotional arousal, with anger and excitement, for example, being characterised by high levels of arousal and feeling sad or peaceful by low levels.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In one study, the researchers asked participants to match hundreds of randomly-generated shapes and sounds to feeling angry, excited sad or peaceful. Shapes with lots of corners and sharp angles had high SCs and were also far more likely to be matched to anger and excitement. The same was true for high SC sounds characterised by brief bursts of white noise. In contrast, blobby, swirly shapes and more ‘rounded’ sounds had low SCs, and were predominantly paired with being peaceful or sad.</span></span></p>
<p>Another group of participants were asked to draw shapes that were angry, sad, excited or peaceful. The angry and excited shapes had an average of 24 and 17 corners respectively (a high SC) whereas the sad and peaceful shapes had an average of 9 and 7 corners (a low SC). The SC of a shape could be used to predict its emotional label with close to 80 per cent accuracy, the researchers report.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Sievers and colleagues then analysed recordings of people moving around and also speaking emotionally-neutral sentences while expressing several different emotions. They found that angry speech and movements had a consistently higher SC than sad speech and movements.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers think that the SC of someone’s voice or movements provides a clear signal of how strongly emotionally aroused they are. Being able to perceive this property automatically would clearly be useful for survival. If the person coming towards you is really angry, say, you’d want to pick up on that right away. But these associations seem to be so fundamental that we link any visual input or sound with a high SC (including spiky shapes, death metal and a brutalist building design) to the high-arousal emotions of anger or excitement, and anything with a low SC (such as clouds, the sound of lullabies and the swirling gravel of Zen gardens) to feeling calm (or possibly sad — context will clearly play a role).</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">This process could also account for the classic “cross-modal” finding, first reported in 1929 and replicated around the world many times since, that people tend to pair a blobby shape with a word-sound like “bouba” and a spiky shape with a word like “kiki”. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">When it comes to reading emotion in vocalisations, other animals may use a similar approach. In 2017, another team reported that English-, German- and Mandarin-speakers were </span></span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318702316_Humans_recognize_emotional_arousal_in_vocalizations_across_all_classes_of_terrestrial_vertebrates_Evidence_for_acoustic_universals"><span class="Hyperlink0"><span style="color: black;">all able to identify higher levels of arousal in vocalisations from a range of species</span></span></a><span class="None">, including amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The spectral centroid may relate to emotional arousal not just across cultures but across species, Sievers and colleagues write.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“By understanding how the brain extracts low-level cross-modal features to determine meaning, we can build a deeper understanding of how communication can transcend immense geographic, cultural, and genetic variation,” the team concludes. </span></span></p>

Experts have long understood that air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32345-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contributes to many serious health problems</a>, like asthma, heart disease and cancer. More recently, research has shown that air pollution <a href="https://hbbf.org/sites/default/files/documents/2018-06/LinkFossilFuelsNeurologicalHarm_04-06-18_v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">harms our brains and our mental abilities</a> too—especially among children (including unborn babies), the elderly, and people living in poverty.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11238" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11238" height="260" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/brain-1-300x260.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Air pollution may cause delays in brain development, reduced IQ and learning difficulties. © Siarhei / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>For children, these harms include delays in development, reduced IQ, attention deficits, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and autism, even when the exposure occurs before birth. In older adults, exposure to air pollution can contribute to dementia and possibly Alzheimer’s Disease.  People living in poverty are often most exposed to air pollution, because of where they work and live.</p>
<p>Previous <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/do-americans-understand-how-air-pollution-from-fossil-fuels-harms-health/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> suggests that many Americans are unaware of the myriad ways in which air pollution from fossil fuels harms our health. For example, only about half (55%) of Americans are able to name a single health impact, and the most frequently cited health effects are general (e.g., breathing problems) rather specific conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD). Notably, only one percent of Americans cited neurological problems.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">large</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1063357" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">body</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE2009" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence</a> suggests that a transition away from fossil fuels toward a clean energy economy will dramatically improve public health. Thus, a key question becomes: what is the best way to build public support for a clean energy economy?</p>
<p>We set out to answer this question by identifying specific evidence-based messages about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels that are the most concerning to Americans. Additionally, we sought to ascertain whether exposure to such messages would cause changes in people’s attitudes and behavioral intentions in a manner consistent with support for a transition to clean energy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Participants were most concerned about the potential harm to children’s brains.</p></blockquote>
<p>To do this, we surveyed a large, demographically-diverse group of American adults (n=1644) and asked them to rank a set of ten different statements about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels in terms of which ones were the most and least concerning to them. We also assessed the cumulative impact of reading the ten statements by measuring participants’ attitudes about air pollution, fossil fuels, and clean energy both before and after the ranking task.</p>
<p>We found that the harms to older adults’ brains as well as the more well-established harms associated with asthma, heart disease and cancer were of concern, but our participants were most concerned about the potential harm to children’s brains. What’s more, this general pattern of results was largely consistent across a number of partisan and demographic subgroups, even among older adults and those living in low-income households.</p>
<p>After the ranking exercise, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats alike exhibited increases in perceived health harm of air pollution and fossil fuels, a desire for more clean energy, and intention to engage in consumer advocacy to support clean energy.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11239" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11239 size-medium" height="209" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/health-message-300x209.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Health professionals could lead the way in public engagement efforts. © natali_mis / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our research findings are not unique; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.05.004" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other teams</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa557" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> are reaching <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.107" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar conclusions</a>. In total, these studies provide strong evidence of the value of communicating about the health effects associated with burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Efforts to communicate about the harms of air pollution to heart and lung disease and cancer are reasonably well-established— thanks to <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/outdoor/fighting-for-healthy-air/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the efforts of the American Lung Association</a> and others—and should be continued. Efforts should now be organized to communicate about the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels on our brains, particularly the neurodevelopmental impacts on babies and children.</p>
<blockquote><p>Health messages have great potential to help the public and policymakers understand what’s really at stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Health professionals and health organizations are the ideal messengers to be leading these public engagement efforts, because doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other professionals are among the most trusted members of every community.</p>
<p>Health messages about air pollution and fossil fuels—delivered repeatedly in clear terms by a variety of trusted health professionals—have great potential to help the public and policymakers understand what’s really at stake.</p>
<p>They also have the potential to involve important new stakeholders and other trusted voices—like groups concerned about the wellbeing of babies before birth—who have not traditionally been involved in the campaign to clean our air. This public engagement strategy offers the very real possibility of breaking through the political gridlock for the benefit everyone’s health.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The role of birth order in shaping who we are has been a matter of some debate in psychology. Recent research has <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/14/1506451112">cast doubt</a> on the idea that an individual’s position in relation to their siblings influences their personality, for instance. But there may be other domains where birth order is still important: in particular, researchers have found that children with a greater number of older siblings seem to have worse verbal skills.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619861436">new study published in <em>Psychological Science </em></a>has found that the situation is a bit more complicated than that.  Young children with an older sibling do indeed perform worse on language measures, the authors find — but only if that sibling is a brother.</p>
<p><span id="more-37673"></span></p>
<p>Parents only have a limited amount of time and attention they can split between their children, so the more siblings a child has, the less input they will personally receive from their parents. As parents play an important role in their child’s language development, this could explain why those with a greater number of older siblings have worse language skills.</p>
<p>Naomi Havron at PSL Université and colleagues were interested in how this effect is influenced by the age and sex of an older sibling. There may be less of a negative impact if there is a bigger age gap between siblings, or if the older sibling is a girl, the researchers reasoned. A much older sibling will have better verbal skills, so could themselves become a useful source for younger children to learn about language. And girls tend to have more advanced language skills than boys, so a sister may also provide better input to their younger sibling.</p>
<p>To test these theories, Havron and colleagues looked at data from an ongoing French cohort study called EDEN, which has followed children, and their mothers, from before birth through to age 11. At ages 2, 3 and 5-6, the children’s language skills were measured: at age 2 this simply involved mothers indicating which words their child could say, but at later ages children completed tests such as repeating words and sentences, naming pictures and listing animals. The team analysed the data from 1,276 children who had completed the language tests, including 547 who had an older brother or sister.</p>
<p>The researchers found that, on average, children who had an older sibling had worse language skills than those who didn’t. But as they predicted, the sex of an older sibling was important: kids with older sisters had better language skills than those with older brothers. In fact, a subsequent analysis showed that children with an older sister didn’t actually differ in their language skills from those with no older sibling. On the other hand, the age gap between the siblings didn’t appear to make any difference to language ability after all.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear why children perform better when they have older sisters, the researchers write. It could be that sisters have better language abilities or are more nurturing than brothers — but another possible explanation is that sisters are less demanding on their parents, taking less parental attention away from their younger siblings than do brothers. Whatever the reason, the authors say,  “it … might be more accurate to think of the well-established negative older-sibling effect as an older-brother effect.”</p>
<p>But having an older brother isn’t all bad. Other studies have found that children with older siblings are actually <em>better</em> at some of the social aspects of language, like joining in conversations. And it’s also important to note that although statistically significant, the size of the effects in the study were rather small — and restricted to just a sample of French speakers. It remains to be seen whether similar results are seen in children in other cultures or who speak other languages.</p>

The European conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) is a major bioinformatics and computational biology meeting which is held jointly with the ISMB meeting every two years. Together, ISMB/ECCB brings together people from the fields of computer science, molecular biology, mathematics, statistics and other related fields, showcasing the best and latest developments in bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>

<p>ISMBECCB  2019 took place in Basel, Switzerland. In general, the conference is very much focused on its Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs. There were 20 COSI tracks and workshops present at the meeting this year, all representing major research areas in the field of computational biology. Each COSI ran their own sessions (COSI tracks) as part of the conference. There were also a number of Special Sessions, Technology Tracks  and two Special Tracks (on <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/bd2k.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Big Data to Knowledge</a> (BD2K) and <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/elixir.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elixir</a>).</p>
<p>As you can imagine from such a comprehensive, multi-track program, it’s simply not possible to cover everything here. But here is a quick summary of some of the highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Keynote speakers</strong></p>
<p>As is always the case at ISCB conferences, delegates were treated to a number of excellent presentations by some prestigious keynote speakers.</p>
<p>These included <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/n-rajewsky" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikolaus Rajewsky</a>, from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, presenting his work using single-cell approaches to investigate gene regulation in space and time, <a href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Stafford Noble</a>, from the University of Washington, on using machine learning methods to gain insights in complex genomic or proteomic data and <a href="https://lab.dessimoz.org/people/christophe-dessimoz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christophe Dessimoz</a>, who discussed his research on the challenges and rewards of benchmarking.</p>
<p>Rather excitingly, the conference offered <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscblive-streaming-content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live-streaming</a> of all the Distinguished Keynotes for all ISCB members that were not able to attend.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11211 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/20190724_124404-225x300.jpg" width="225" />
<p><strong>Awards</strong></p>
<p>Every year, ISCB <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscb-awards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gives out four awards to recognize specific achievements</a> by researchers in the field.</p>
<p>This year, it included William Stafford Noble, winner of the ISCB Innovator award, who has recently joined the <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em> editorial board as an Associate Editor</p>
<p>Other winners include Bonnie Berger (ISCB Accomplishment by a senior scientist award), Barb Bryant (Outstanding contributions to ISCB award) and Christophe Dessimov (ISCB Overton prize).</p>
<p><strong>Supporting young scientists</strong></p>
<p>But, the meeting wasn’t just about the top scientists in the field. It was  was opened with a one day student symposium, with tutorials on a wide range of topics including interpretability for deep learning models, visualization of large biological data and tools for reproducible research.</p>
<p>There were over 1,100 posters on display at the conference, many from early career researchers, the lively sessions giving young scientists an opportunity to talk about their work;  there were posters from different categories throughout the conference on a very diverse range of topics. Just to give a flavor on what was on display, there were posters on energetic conflicts in the catalytic sites of proteins, <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/scdo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Sickle Cell Disease Ontology</a>, modeling of immune responses to Clostridium difficile infection, “Nightingale”, which is a library of reusable data visualization components and a number of posters on bioinformatics teaching and teaching resources.</p>

<p>The conference also introduced CompBio Ignite talks, providing researchers not selected for oral presentations the opportunity to give a six-minute so called “lighting style” talk throughout the lunch hour.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the scientific community</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned, the ISMB has a well-established collaboration with a number of Communities of Special Interest (COSIs), including<a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/sysmod.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> SysMod: Computational Modeling of Biological Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/mlcsb.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MLCSB: Machine Learning in Computational and Systems Biology</a> and <a href="https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2019/3dsig.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3DSIG: Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics</a>.</p>
<p>The keynote at the 3DSIG session, presented by Torsten Schwede, from the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, was a celebration of 25 years of the automated protein structure homology-modelling server, SWISS-MODEL, its recent progress and some key lessons have been learned throughout its development.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting talks in the MLCSB COSI session described DrugCell, a “visible” neural network based artificial intelligence that predicts anti-cancer drug responses, taking into account structural features of the drugs themselves as well as the genomic features of the cells affected. The researchers found that the compound that performed best was the drug vincristine, with the neural network highlighting the well-defined pathways affected by the drug, such as cell adhesion and division.</p>
<p>And the SysMod keynote, presented by Trey Ideker, presented the <a href="http://ccmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cancer Map Initiative</a>, the aim of the project being to produce a complete map of the gene and protein wiring diagram of a cancer cell, information that is vital for developing computational models of cancer cells for both basic and clinical research.</p>
<p><strong>Final impressions</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that struck me about this conference was the support given to young researchers, not only in terms of the training program, but also giving them the opportunity to describe their research to a specialized audience and the possibility of networking and setting up collaborations. The field of computational biology is exciting and fast paced and I particularly enjoyed the MLCSB sessions and hearing more about Elixir and the work they do to support some of the field’s most important resources. I look forward to attending the ISMB conference next year, which will be held in Montreal.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Is it possible to spot the signs of future psychopathy in a child? Some researchers have argued that it is <span class="None">— </span>by looking at the child’s level of “interpersonal callousness” (IC), or the extent to which they are manipulative, dishonest, and show a lack of guilt, remorse or distress at being punished. Indeed, previous studies have found that children who rank high for IC are more likely to develop psychopathic features, as well as to commit violent offences in adolescence and adulthood. So, case closed?</span></p>
<p>Not according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-39486-001">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. This work, led by Meagan Docherty and Jordan Beardslee at Arizona State University, suggests that other important risk factors for these negative outcomes in adolescence and adulthood haven’t been properly taken into account — and that when they are, the apparent link between childhood callousness and psychopathy in adulthood disappears.</p>
<p><span id="more-37657"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Docherty and Beardslee’s team analysed data collected for the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), in which boys were regularly interviewed and assessed using a variety of measures, from their early childhood in the late 1980s through to adulthood. The PYS group was deliberately skewed to over-include boys who, based on early problem behaviour, were considered to be at a higher risk of going on to commit serious crimes. The datasets also included any official records of later offending, and the results of follow-up assessments of psychopathic features, physical aggression and antisocial behaviour on into adulthood.</span></p>
<p>The 503 participants included in this study had been rated for callousness each year from the ages of 8 to 15 by their teachers, who assessed their level of agreement with statements like “doesn’t seem to feel guilty after misbehaving.” The team divided the participants into various callousness groups: those deemed to have low, moderate or high IC levels, for example; groups who’d shown callousness only during childhood, or in whom it appeared only in adolescence; and also a group in which IC developed early on and remained high and stable. They then compared this data with levels of psychopathic features (such as being manipulative or antisocial) and physical aggression at age 29, and also, as a measure of antisocial behaviour, official criminal records.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers also took into account a number of potentially confounding factors that might themselves relate to later violent crimes or psychopathy. These included any records of arrests by age 15, and also “externalising” behaviours (physical aggression, verbal bullying and defiance, for example) during adolescence. </span></p>
<p>When these factors were included in the analysis, membership of the various callousness groups during childhood or adolescence did not predict later adult psychopathic features. This means that people who’d been deemed to have high IC as children were no more likely to show signs of psychopathy in adulthood than those who’d had no or low levels of callousness in childhood. “These results suggest that the stability from IC early in life to psychopathic features in adulthood might be overstated in prior studies that do not control for early problem behaviours,” the researchers write.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">There were, though, associations between certain callousness groups and aggression and antisocial behaviour in adolescence and adulthood. Those participants with early-onset, high-level and stable callousness were more likely to be aggressive and to engage in serious violence in adulthood. (Members of this particular IC group were two to three times more likely to be arrested for serious violence than those in any other IC group.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The team says that they would like to see more research into why IC follows distinct patterns in different young people. Perhaps warm parenting can ‘treat’ deficits in moral development, which might appear as symptoms of IC in childhood that vanish by adolescence, for example; in contrast, harsh parenting might encourage the emergence of IC in otherwise typical adolescents. </span></p>

The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875-1961) was one of the best-known psychologists of the 20th century. He introduced such famous concepts as introverted and extraverted personalities, and the idea of the psychological 'complex'.



Today, Jungian or analytical psychology retains an active community. But a recently published Open Letter from a number of prominent Jungians points to troubles within the fold.



The letter acknowledges that Jung's writings contained racism, and apologizes for

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/7-690x3203-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><h5>Note: This blog was written by Renee Hoch, Senior Editor, Team Manager for <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s Publication Ethics Editorial team</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integrity of image data in primary research articles has emerged as a major concern in publication ethics. Studies querying the frequency of image concerns have indicated that 4-25% of published research articles in the biomedical and life sciences may include unreported image splicing, duplications, and/or manipulations with potential repercussions for the reliability of the results [1-4]. These issues can stem from honest errors, efforts to beautify or clarify the results, poor data management, poor knowledge as to best practice standards in image data reporting, or fraudulent misrepresentation of experimental results. Whatever the root cause, image integrity issues can damage the reliability of – and public trust in – the scientific literature.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can journals do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now the majority of image concern cases at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been raised post-publication, although some are spotted during peer review. We follow up on such issues regardless of when they are raised, but it would benefit authors, journals, and readers to try to identify and address more of these concerns prior to publication. To this end, as discussed recently at the 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> World Conference on Research Integrity, some journals have implemented dedicated pre-publication image screening; developers are working on software tools to help identify issues such as splicing and duplications; and a group at the Headt Center in Berlin is developing an </span><a href="https://headt.eu/The-Image-Integrity-Database/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Integrity Database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [5] that can be used to test new software tools. Solutions are needed which can be applied at scale within the context of journal checks and/or peer review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are taking a policy-based approach to proactively address image integrity for blot and gel results: we now require that authors submit the underlying raw images to support all blot and gel image data reported in a submission’s figures or supporting information files. The raw data will be assessed during peer review (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or before acceptance (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and if a manuscript is accepted the underlying image data will be published as supporting information or provided via a public data repository. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why require raw blot and gel data?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new policy focuses on blot and gel reporting because these types of  images comprise the most prevalent category of image concerns that our editorial teams handle, and the raw image data underlying these figures are particularly informative in clarifying the reliability of the reported results. Under the new policy, editors and reviewers will have access to the underlying image data before publication so that they can verify the reported results and consider these data when making decisions as to whether the work complies with the journals’ guidelines and publication requirements. With the raw data, editors and reviewers will be better equipped to identify any concerns about these results in the context of peer review, so that authors can address questions about their data and resolve honest data reporting errors prior to publication. With this new policy and the support of our authors, Academic Editors, and reviewers, we aim to strengthen the integrity and reproducibility of our published articles.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(based on</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases resolved 1/2017-5/2019)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new policy will bring our data reporting requirements for blot and gel results into better alignment with PLOS’ and the greater community’s open data-sharing objectives. Since 2014, PLOS’ </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Availability Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has required that authors provide the underlying data supporting an article’s results. For image data, our policy has specified that authors provide “sample” images to support the results, but has not provided clear instructions about our expectations for sample images. One could consider published figure panels to be representative sample images but these rarely include the original image data: images are typically cropped, adjusted, and in some cases manipulated (stretched, spliced, contrast adjusted, etc.) during figure preparation. While such alterations may be acceptable if transparently reported and abiding by best practice standards, they can also lead to questions about a figure’s integrity, make it difficult to assess the results, and in some cases lead to loss of important information such as about reagent specificity or experimental controls. The original data play an essential role in clarifying such issues when raised, but unfortunately authors are often unable to provide these data after publication (Figure 1 and [6]). </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifies our blot/gel image data requirements in detail, and aims to ensure the availability of blot/gel image data after  an article’s publication. We have also updated our </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-reporting-blot-and-gel-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blot/gel reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-preparing-figures-from-image-files"><span style="font-weight: 400;">figure preparation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guidelines to increase awareness of best practices in blot and gel presentation and support transparency in data reporting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sincerely thank all who provided advice on these recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> updates, and we thank our authors in advance for working with us towards these higher image data reporting standards. We appreciate that the new policy may require extra work, but we hope that these efforts will positively impact the integrity and reproducibility of the published record and ultimately benefit the scientific community.</span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>In a world made for right-handed people, life can sometimes be frustrating if you are among the 10% or so who are “adextral” — that is, left-handed or ambidextrous. Now a new grievance can be added to the list. Brain imaging researchers are systematically excluding adextrals from participating in their studies, according to an analysis of recent research papers published in top neuroimaging journals. Yet there’s no good reason to exclude this population, say the authors — and in fact, the practice could be detrimental to research.</p>
<p><span id="more-37652"></span></p>
<p>The tendency to include only right-handed people in neuroimaging research stems from the finding that certain processes are represented differently in the brains of adextrals. In particular, while the left hemisphere of the brain dominates language processing in almost all right-handed people, in about 30% of adextrals this processing occurs predominantly in the right hemisphere (or both hemispheres). Handedness also influences how the brain represents sensation and movement of the hands. Many neuropsychologists have therefore avoided recruiting adextrals for fear of affecting their data.</p>
<p>But Lyam Bailey and colleagues at Dalhousie University noticed that researchers were excluding adextrals from a range of studies unrelated to language or movement, even though there is little evidence that handedness influences other processes. So in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.14542">their new paper</a>, published in the <em>European of Journal of Neuroscience</em>, the team investigated whether there is evidence for this bias in the literature. The researchers looked at 1,008 articles published in three major neuroimaging journals across the course of 2017, noting whether each study reported participants’ handedness — and if so, how many adextral participants were included.</p>
<p>The team found that a little over half of the studies reported participants’ handedness. But of the almost 32,000 people in those studies, only 3.2% were adextral — considerably lower than the rate of 10-13% in the general population. Overall, fewer than one in five of the studies that reported handedness included any adextrals at all, suggesting that most were actively excluding these people.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, studies looking at clinical populations and children were more likely to include adextral participants than those on non-clinical and adult populations. The authors suggest that this may be because it is harder to recruit from these populations, so researchers are more willing to include non-right-handed people.</p>
<p>The findings are not necessarily that surprising, though it is interesting to see the hard data to back up what many neuropsychologists may have already expected. But the key question is — does it matter that adextrals are underrepresented?</p>
<p>The authors make a convincing case that it does. Handedness is just another kind of individual difference, the researchers write, much like memory capacity or socioeconomic status. Both of those factors can also influence how language is represented in the brain, but are not normally used as a basis for excluding people from research. And we can only fully understand whether there are any differences in the brains of right- and left-handed people if both groups are actually included in research. “Handedness should be treated with the same measured scientific curiosity that is now afforded to individual differences such as language proficiency, working memory capacity [and] SES,” write the researchers. Instead of excluding adextrals, they add, statistical methods can be used to control for any potential effects of handedness.</p>
<p>And if that’s not enough, the logic for excluding adextrals even from language studies is flawed, say Bailey and colleagues. Although 30% of adextrals don’t show the normal left hemisphere language lateralisation, the same is true for about 4% of right-handed people. And because adextrals already represent a much smaller proportion of the population, including them will have little impact on how many participants have this “atypical lateralisation”.</p>
<p>The researchers say they hope their work will encourage others to take a hard look at whether they really need to be excluding adextrals from their studies. “Such a change in attitudes will surely benefit both our understanding of how handedness relates to brain function, organization and structure and, more broadly, our understanding of the brain at the whole-population level,” they write.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Throughout our lives, we set ourselves goals — to pass an exam, run a marathon, lose 10 kilograms of excess weight or gain a promotion. Given the importance of such goals to our physical and psychological wellbeing, it’s not surprising that there’s has been a wealth of research into how best to set, work towards, and achieve them.</p>
<p>But let’s say you succeed — what then? Psychologists have paid less attention to people’s behaviour <em>after</em> they’ve achieved their goals. And although it’s generally good for us to continue to study, exercise, eat healthily, work hard, and so on, this doesn’t always transpire. For example, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21538">one follow-up</a> of contestants who’d won the weight-loss TV show <em>The Biggest Loser</em> found that six years on, most weighed even more than they had at the start of the show.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-34220-001">recent study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em> offers a solution. People are more likely to maintain good behaviours, the researchers find, if instead of thinking about achieving a goal as “arriving at a destination,” they view it as “completing a journey.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37644"></span></p>
<p>We rely heavily on metaphor when considering abstract concepts and aspects of our lives. So Szu-Chi Huang and Jennifer Aaker at the Stanford Graduate School of Business reasoned that thinking about a goal as the completion of a journey might prompt people to reflect on how they had been at the start, and all the ups and downs along the way. This might make them feel that they had changed to be the kind of person who engages in these specific behaviours, and make them more likely to maintain them.</p>
<p>In a series of six studies involving more than 1,600 people, this is exactly what the pair found. They first looked at two groups comprising more than 400 American students and university staff who had recently achieved <span>either</span><span> </span><span>an academic or a fitness goal. Participants were asked to think about how their experience of attaining the goal was like “completing a journey” or “reaching a destination,” or were just told to think about achieving the goal without a metaphor attached. Those who viewed the goal as the completion of a journey not only expressed stronger intentions to continue the goal-related behaviours, but actually did so (the fitness journey group were more likely to sign up for an ongoing fitness programme, for example).</span></p>
<p>In subsequent research, the team further characterised this effect. In one study, 265 dieters set themselves daily calorie intake goals and tracked their consumption over seven days. After the end of the diet programme, those who thought about their achievement as the completion of a journey were again more likely to indicate that they would continue their dieting behaviour. And importantly, this group also had greater feelings of personal growth, suggesting this could be the underlying mechanism for the effect.</p>
<p>Another study, which involved a 14-day walking programme with a goal of achieving 100,000 steps, revealed that the journey metaphor encouraged beneficial behaviour after participants had attained their goal, but not when they were getting close to achieving it. When a goal is in sight, but not yet achieved, “focusing on the destination aspects of this path could be more motivating, likely because it accentuated the end goal that one still needed to achieve,” the pair notes.</p>
<p>And the phenomenon was not just restricted to American participants. In a final study, the researchers followed 106 executives who were finishing a business education programme in Ghana. In what they were told was an exit interview, the participants were encouraged to describe their attainment of their qualification using a journey or a destination metaphor. Six months on, members of the journey group were more likely to be using practices they had learned on the course.</p>
<p>It’s true that getting people to think about their journey to achieving a goal might not always work, or may even backfire — if the journey has been very hard or unpleasant, for example. However, the researchers add, “it is our hope that this research serves as the beginning of a journey of diverse research programs that utilize a variety of metaphors to enhance goal pursuers’ chances of maintaining their success.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Blog-Header-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><strong>Guest Authors: Dylan Roskams-Edris (Open Science Consultant and Invited Scholar with the Center for Genomics and Policy,), JB Poline (Associate Professor, Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University), and Nikola Stikov (Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal).</strong></p>
<p><strong>First off, what is Plan S and why does it matter?</strong></p>
<p>In September 2018 <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">a group of European funding agencies, along with some private funders</a>, assessed how scientific information is disseminated – namely that university researchers receive public funding, perform experiments, collect data, write articles about the results, review each other’s articles, and then the publicly funded institutions they work for foot the ever increasing bill to buy access to all this work – and decided enough was enough; publicly funded science should be publicly accessible.</p>
<p>They formed<em> cOAlition S</em> and announced <em>Plan S</em> which, boiled down, says that after 2020 any work funded in whole or in part by the members of the coalition must be published in journals that allow immediate, free, and public access to articles. They also published a set of guidelines and best practices that journals publishing funded research must follow. Those interested in the details of Plan S are encouraged to read about them <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Only 5 months after Plan S was revealed, the University of California system – one of the largest and most well-respected public academic systems in the world – <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">announced that they were ending their relationship with the publisher Elsevier</a>. The split was due primarily to Elsevier’s refusal to make all UC published research open access on the UC’s terms.</p>
<p>These efforts are a great start.</p>
<p>For those actively working to open global research efforts, however, efforts like Plan S are only the beginning. The push for open science is much larger than making scholarly articles open access. Open science demands that the data, software, materials, and know-how that enables science are also shared – or better yet, openly published.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing, Publishing, and Open Access Articles</strong></p>
<p>It is worth pausing here for a brief aside about the distinction between open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open access publishing of articles. All of these are important but for open science to be successful the distinction between them has to be clear.</p>
<p>Open sharing consists of making research resources available in a way they can be freely accessed and used. Sharing datasets in a repository or data sharing platform like <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/organization">Dryad</a>, or code used for data analysis and visualization via a service like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, are good examples. Sharing in this way rapidly disseminates resources and makes them available for use and adaptation by others as quickly as possible. Open publishing of research resources, however, involves the filtration of these resources through other researchers. These peer researchers make sure that the shared resource – whether it is data, code, single figures, or any of the plethora of resources developed throughout the scientific process – is in a form that is standard and easily usable by others, as well as presenting those resources in a curated form on a website or repository. Open access publishing of articles is the primary target of efforts like Plan S and relates to publishing scholarly articles in such a way that they are freely accessible and usable.</p>
<p><a href="http://conp.ca/">The Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a> (CONP), along with myriad other organizations, are developing the resources needed to enable open sharing, open publishing of research resources, and open publishing of articles. By doing so the CONP is helping open science and reduce the current inequalities in access to all of the tools and research outputs science needs to thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Publications</strong></p>
<p>Assessing the situation here in Canada, the current <a href="http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html?OpenDocument">open access policies of Canada’s primary trio of scientific funding agencies</a> take a weaker stance than Plan S and, as we’ve already argued, efforts like Plan S are only a start. Even if Canada were to suddenly marshal its forces of scientific-policy and follow the lead of cOAlition S we would still be well behind where open science should be. Scholarly papers are just the tip of the iceberg of scientific discovery. Any given publication is the result of months of work involving data collection, coming up with hypotheses, planning experiments, carefully recording progress in notebooks, developing software, analyzing results, writing drafts, and working with editors. The iceberg metaphor is a good one; the publication, like the burg’s tip, is what is seen, but floats atop a much larger body of work that supports it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8719" height="447" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/08/Iceberg.png" width="482" /></a></p>
<p>Open science in its full and rich instantiation is about sharing and publishing all as many scientific resources as possible to enable collaboration throughout the research process. It grows from the simple idea that working together is more effective than working in silos; that many hands make light work and many eyes spot more errors. In order to work together scientists need to be able to freely discover each other’s work and use each other’s resources, not just have access to the polished end result. Doing so will improve replication, catch errors in methodology early on, and prevent redundancy, all while reducing unnecessary barriers to discovery and outlays from the public coffers.</p>
<p>The internet and modern computing technology make this dissemination possible. What we need now is for funders, institutions, and scientists themselves to commit to encouraging and enabling the sharing their data, code, notebooks, experimental protocols, draft manuscripts, and all the other pivotal elements of discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Building on Plan S</strong></p>
<p>Plan S does mention the sharing of scientific data. On their <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/">Principles and Implementation</a> page they encourage the sharing of research resources underlying publications in repositories that make the resource “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”, as well as highlighting resource sharing as a key topic of negotiations between journals, funders, and institutions. Doing so, however, requires repositories where data and code that can be stored, data sharing platforms where that data can easily linked to publications, as well as organized curation efforts to make sure the linked research resources are usable by others.</p>
<p>The CONP is building exactly these resources for the neuroscience community. It is collaboratively developing the user portal, online publishing, informational resources, and governance and policy mechanisms that will enable neuroscientists to disseminate each component of their work as openly as possible, and to keep them open. The CONP scientists and stakeholders believe that these resources will catalyze collaboration and accelerate neuroscientific discovery.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Needed Now to Go Further</strong></p>
<p>But more is needed.</p>
<p>Opening science requires the collective effort of funders, data sharing platforms, academic institutions, and individual scientists. Science doesn’t have to be opened all at once, but steps down the open road must be taken, and must be taken now. The CONP will provide tools and guidance, but scientific culture shift requires a concerted community effort.</p>
<p>Some first steps needed to enable the open publishing of all research resources include: (1) forging agreements and partnerships between journals and open science platforms to make it easy for scientists to share their data, publish it in a curated form, and link it to publications, (2) promotion and tenure policies at academic institutions that value the sharing and publishing of data <em>on par</em> with producing articles, (3) funding agencies that require (and enforce) sharing and publishing data, code, and materials associated with publications as a condition of receiving a grant, and (4) a commitment from scientists themselves to change the culture of science towards openly sharing and publishing as many of their resources as they can.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/tick-2371782_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of specific ticks and has a variety of clinical presentations, most notably a bull’s eye rash (erythema migrans) and an associated flu-like illness. Its distribution through Europe is heterogenous with a large variation in incidence between countries and within them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the United Kingdom, information relating to infected patients’ characteristics, where they live and how they are managed within the National Health Service (NHS), is poorly understood. Currently most information is derived from Public Health England’s and Health Protection Scotland’s laboratory surveillance schemes. We are very fortunate that in England and Wales, data from all NHS hospitals are readily available, which enables the analysis of a variety of different medical conditions at a national level.</p>
<p>Through the analysis of these data we were able to describe which Lyme disease patients access hospitals for management and treatment, and for the first time, start to describe how patients enter and progress through NHS care.</p>
<p>Over an eighteen-year period (1998-2015) we observed a six-fold increase in cases seen in hospitals. Numbers of cases that require hospital admission are still relatively low compared to national surveillance figures. Most Lyme disease cases are confirmed and treated with antibiotics by a GP without the need for laboratory diagnosis or referral to a hospital. UK national surveillance figures are based solely on laboratory-confirmed cases. These figures will include a mixture of cases from primary care and hospitals. Therefore, current surveillance figures will always have a higher incidence than hospital cases alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cases that require hospital admission likely represent more clinically complex cases. They are also substantially lower than similar hospital figures reported in continental Europe. We found that cases peaked each year in August; this is consistent with people being active outdoors whilst ticks are questing for a blood meal.</p>
<p>Lyme disease patients attending hospitals were predominantly female and self-identified as white. The ages most affected were young children (6-10 years old) and adults approaching retirement age (61-65 years old).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11191" style="width: 343px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11191" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-3-300x243.png" width="333" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3 – Population demographics of Lyme disease patients within hospital administrative records in England and Wales (1998-2015)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Almost all parts of England and Wales reported Lyme disease cases attending hospitals with clear hotspots of disease in central southern England. This highlights that while Lyme disease poses a risk across both countries, for most people this risk is likely to be very low as the majority of cases were found in these hotspots. Unsurprisingly, more cases were found in rural rather than urban locations. These data are based on where a patient lives rather than where they were bitten and so provides a more accurate estimate of where clinical burden will be placed on NHS hospitals.</p>
<p>This study is one of only a handful that describe the sociodemographics of the population affected by Lyme disease. We found a trend that increasing numbers of new patients were found in parts of the countries that are considered to have low levels of economic deprivation. The data collected gives no indication why this is the case and it is likely to be due to multiple factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable parts of the population which would aid in future tick bite prevention and Lyme disease awareness campaigns.</p>
<p>The most novel part of the research describes how patients with Lyme disease are managed within hospitals and the NHS. The majority of patients were only admitted once and stayed  4.47 days, on average. 35.5% of all patients were admitted as a day case. The variety in admission length and departments treating the patient could represent either diversity and complexity of Lyme disease symptoms or differing management strategies within hospitals. This needs to be explored as it appears that the management of Lyme disease patients in hospitals is discordant.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11193" style="width: 378px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11193" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Figure-4-300x279.png" width="368" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 4 – The average incidence rate of Lyme disease in English and Welsh local authorities (n=348), (1998-2015)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>More than thirty percent of patients with Lyme disease enter hospital through the accident and emergency department. It is unlikely that all of these patients have acute symptoms. Why are patients accessing care through this route? It could be due to a lack of knowledge or the inability to get an appointment with a primary care clinician. This requires further exploration.</p>
<p>This study, like previous ones based on administrative data, may be limited by some patients not being coded correctly as having Lyme disease in hospital records. It would be difficult to truly validate the cases we identified without reading each patients written hospital notes, this would be ethically challenging. Despite these limitations, the strong trends described in this paper may indicate that these are small.</p>
<p>Linking this data to both primary care and laboratory data would facilitate a better account of the Lyme disease patient care pathway. Adding to our understanding of these factors could lead to better patient care, education and resource allocation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales</p></blockquote>
<p>This research has highlighted that Lyme disease patients are seen at most hospitals across England and Wales. However, Lyme disease presentation in hospital is an uncommon event except in southern-central England. Patient care within the NHS is not streamlined and may reflect variation in patient management or the range of Lyme disease symptoms. This work can provide a reference point to future Lyme disease research in the United Kingdom and any Lyme disease hospital-based research internationally.</p>
<p>Being aware of the signs &amp; symptoms of Lyme Disease is important so that you can receive early diagnosis and treatment from your family doctor. Symptoms typically develop up to 3 weeks after being bitten by a tick and include a spreading circular red rash or flu-like symptoms. When you visit your GP or call NHS 111, remember to tell them where you have been and if you remember being bitten.
