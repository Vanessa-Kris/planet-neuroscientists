              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/707587766/0/oupblogpsychology/">From navigation to architecture: how the brain interprets spaces and designs places</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/from-navigation-to-architecture-how-the-brain-interprets-spaces-and-designs-places/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oxford-gab570d01b_1920-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>How do our brains help us learn about the spatial relationships in our world and then use them to find our way from one place to another? And how might answering this question offer new insights into how architects design?</p><p>One possible answer to the first question came from the Nobel-prize winning discovery by John O&#8217;Keefe and his colleagues that linked navigation to the <em>hippocampus</em> of the rat brain. O’Keefe discovered neurons whose firing encoded where, in its small world, the animal found itself. More specifically, if the animal moved around a small box or simple maze, there were neurons—he called them <em>place cells</em>—that fired only when the animal was in a small region that he called the <em>place field</em> of the place cell.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="355" height="432" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-1.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>The “seahorse” cross section of hippocampus showing a schematization of core neural circuitry, as drawn by the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1899).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>But pause a moment. The word “place” can mean somewhat different things. In response to the question “Where did you meet Luigi?”, the natural answer would be, perhaps, “On the Belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone.” But place could also require detail like “30 meters from the left end of the Belvedere and 50 centimeters back from the balustrade.” So, going forward, let’s distinguish a significant or memorable place from a metrically defined place, and reserve the word <strong>place</strong> for the first usage and <strong>location</strong> for the second.</p><h2>Cognitive mapping and navigation</h2><p>Note that “knowing where you are” is very different from “being able to navigate.” A billboard on which there is an “x” with the legend “you are here” and is otherwise blank, is not a map. A map must encode all the places that matter to us and the paths we need to find a route from where we are to where we want to be, even if we have never before travelled between these two places. If the map is “in our head” we call it a&nbsp;<em>cognitive map</em>. The alternative to figuring out a path is simply to follow a route—whether a habitual route or one specified by a friend or smartphone.</p><p>In 1975-6, Israel Lieblich and I developed a computational account of how rats could find satisfactory paths through mazes depending on whether they were hungry, thirsty, or fearful. We modeled a cognitive map as a structure with nodes to represent significant places and with edges for the direct paths between them. We called this structure a <em>World Graph</em> (WG), but there are many such graphs at very different scales—whether encoding the places where food, water, or fearful stimuli can be found in a rat’s maze; the stations and connecting lines in a subway map; or the route maps of airlines that are indeed maps of the world—that <em>differ in what constitutes a significant place when employing the map</em>. Thus, we may have multiple WGs for the same territory.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="202" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-2.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>The Bridges of Königsberg problem: Is there a walk through the city that would cross each of its seven bridges (shown at Left) once and only once? (Right) The graph generated by Leonhard Euler (1736) as the basis for a general mathematical theorem which implies that no such walk exists. Each land area becomes a node, while each bridge becomes an edge.</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><h2>Cognitive mapping and architectural design</h2><p>Just as a cognitive map is different from a set of fixed paths, so the cognitive scientist’s sense of&nbsp;<em>script</em>&nbsp;is very different from the script of a play, where who says what and when is prescribed in advance. Consider the “birthday party” script: the guests must bring presents, someone must prepare a cake with candles, and the candles must be lit before the birthday-honoree blows them out, etcetera. But whether the presents are opened before or after the cake ceremony, and what other activities are part of the party is not prespecified. Let’s just add that, when a party is held, the activities specified in the script require places in which they occur.&nbsp;</p><p>The implication for architecture is that a building is designed to serve multiple purposes and the architect must envisage how the building will support inhabitants in their performance of relevant scripts. The significant places for a building (or a city) are not only those where one can perform one’s own versions of the practical scripts that the architect has considered, but also those where one can appreciate a particular view, whether from the outside or within. Moreover, a building may succeed not only by satisfying the planned scripts—consider the highly scripted activities that distinguish schools, hospitals, and churches—but also by providing opportunities for users to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>This positive sense of exploration is what we might call&nbsp;<em>waylosing</em>:</p><blockquote><p>I am not advocating waylosing on the way to the maternity ward, but in less stressed situations it can be great fun. Waylosing is &#8230;  one of the great attractions of Venice &#8230; finding something unexpected and useful when looking for something else. (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://segd.org/wayshowing-and-waylosing-mollerup">Per Mollerup</a>, 21 April 2014.)</p></blockquote><p>I thought I had coined the word waylosing before I found this citation and had indeed applied it to the absolute delight of exploring Venice in a random way, far from the madding crowd in Piazza San Marco.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="413" height="616" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-3.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>Waylosing in Venice, 1957. (Author’s photo).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><h2>From scripts to cognitive maps to architecture</h2><p>All this led to a new perspective on architectural design, incorporating insights from brain imaging, neuropsychology, and computational modeling.</p><p>One challenge was to show how fragments of the architect’s memories can morph and combine in the design of forms that will afford new experiences to the future user. This required examining available studies of the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory (recalling past episodes, rather than contributing to a cognitive map) and how it also forms part of larger systems engaged in imagination.&nbsp;When we perform a script within a building, we are developing and exploiting cognitive maps to proceed from place to place within the satisfaction of that script, rather than simply seeking a path from start point to goal. In my book&nbsp;<em>When Brains Meet Buildings,&nbsp;</em>I thus analyzed what it means for the designer, imagining the experiences and behaviors of users of the forthcoming building, to in some sense “invert” the process whereby each user will form their own cognitive maps (note the plural) for the satisfaction of a range of scripts, and as the basis for forming new scripts for their own exploration and enjoyment of the building.</p><p>In sketching ideas for a building, the architect will develop ideas of the form, function, and feeling of the various spaces within and around it. The present discussion focuses on how ideas for different places envisaged to serve practical and aesthetic functions help define the places that will actually be constructed in and around the building. Ideas for these notional places must develop during the design process. These places may satisfy goals within diverse scripts—a focus on the feel of the kitchen might yield a script that demands a place for admiring the view of a garden, another for the meal-preparation script will demand a place to put the oven. At early stages of design, there will be multiple scripts, with each script having its own set of places that define the nodes of what we might call a script-WG. These specifications of the roles of inter-related places complement the architect’s sketches of the form of the building’s spaces, with limited specification of where and how the nodes will be linked to locations in the 3D Euclidean space defined around the site where the building will be constructed. Edges in a preliminary script-WG will simply mark transitions that will occur from one place to another in executing the corresponding script.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="432" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-4.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>Waylosing in Venice, 1957. (Author’s photo).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>All this leads to study of&nbsp;<em>melding diverse scripts</em>&nbsp;as a crucial process: a design that specifies separate places for each node of each script may be both uneconomical and inconvenient. For example, the scripts for food preparation and dishwashing in a home would normally involve using the same sink, whereas in a restaurant they might not.&nbsp;As design proceeds towards construction drawings, the various nodes must become anchored in that Euclidean space. This can include decisions to map certain nodes in distinct script-WGs to the same location, and this entails that the two script-WGs become merged into one as shared nodes inherit their properties and the edges of their progenitors. This in turn requires assessing whether features of one script do or do not block features of the other script as the new WG is refined to accommodate both scripts.&nbsp;The process of working this out may reflect back to modify the “what connects to what” of design at the WG level but also the aesthetics of form that marks the architect’s individual signature in shaping the building.</p><p>The implications of this work are to push understanding of architecture beyond the views offered by glossy photographs in magazines and on websites to engage with a deeper understanding of how people act and interact in the spaces that architects provide. This has implications for linking neuroscience (broadly conceived to include cognitive science and biology more generally) to a deeper understanding of human well-being. It also offers invitations to scientists to extend their studies from the laboratory to the built environment as the basis for fruitful conversations between architecture and neuroscience. To paraphrase John Fitzgerald Kennedy, “Ask not only what neuroscience can do for architecture, but also what architecture can do for neuroscience.”</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/707587766/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/707587766/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f08%2foxford-gab570d01b_1920-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/monument-what-did-shakespeare-look-like/">Monument: what did Shakespeare look like?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/has-russian-journalism-returned-to-soviet-era-restriction/">Has Russian journalism returned to Soviet era restrictions?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/epiphanies-an-interview-with-sophie-grace-chappell/">Epiphanies: an interview with Sophie Grace Chappell</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-bite-misinformation-news-errors">News stories have caught spiders in a web of misinformation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even spiders, it seems, have fallen victim to misinformation.</p>



<p>Media reports about people&#8217;s encounters with spiders tend to be full of falsehoods with a distinctly negative spin. An analysis of a decade’s worth of newspaper stories from dozens of countries finds that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01127-7">nearly half of the reports contain errors</a>, arachnologist Catherine Scott and colleagues report August 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“The vast majority of the spider content out there is about them being scary and hurting people,” says Scott, of McGill University in Montreal. In reality, they note, “spiders almost never bite people.”</p>





<p>Of the roughly 50,000 known spider species, vanishingly few are dangerous. Instead, many spiders benefit us by eating insects like mosquitoes that are harmful to people. Even with the rare exceptions like brown recluse and black widow spiders, bites are extremely uncommon, Scott says. Some stories about bites blamed spiders that don’t occur in the area, and others reported symptoms that don’t match symptoms of actual bites. “So many stories about spider bites included no evidence whatsoever that there was any spider involved,” they say.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, Scott and their colleagues analyzed over 5,000 online newspaper stories about humans and spiders from 2010 to 2020 across 81 countries. In addition to errors, the team determined that 43 percent of the stories were sensationalized, often using words like <em>nasty, killer</em>, <em>agony</em> and <em>nightmare</em>. International and national newspapers were more likely to sensationalize spiders than regional outlets. Stories that included a spider expert were less sensationalistic, though there was no such effect from other experts, including doctors.</p>



<p>If people knew the truth about spiders, they could spend less time blaming them for bites and killing them with pesticides that are toxic to many other species, including humans, Scott says. Clearing up the misinformation would be good for spiders, too — especially the one in your house that doesn’t get squashed out of fear. Spiders in general stand to benefit, the researchers conclude, because news helps shape public opinion, which can influence decisions about wildlife conservation.</p>



<p>“Spiders are kind of unique in that they seem to be really good at capturing people&#8217;s attention,” says arachnologist Lisa Taylor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved in the study. “If that attention is paired with real information about how fascinating they are, rather than sensationalistic misinformation, then I think spiders are well-suited to serve as tiny ambassadors for wildlife in general.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A study published in <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation </em>by Lindsay Jaacks at The University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, United Kingdom, Abhishek Jain at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, New Delhi, India and colleagues suggests that while COVID-19 disrupted agricultural labor, supply chains, and farmers&rsquo; access to credit and markets, the pandemic did not significantly push Indian farmers to adopt more sustainable cultivation practices.

<p>India&rsquo;s agricultural system is largely based on input-intensive monocropping of staple crops. Nearly half of the population is employed in agricultural work, yet the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural practices have not been fully documented. In order to quantify changes in farmers&rsquo; cropping patterns and input use, and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, researchers interviewed 3,637 farmers living in 20 Indian states and union territories by telephone between December 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Findings and Future Research</strong></p>



<p>The researchers found that 84% of farmers reported no change in the type of crops they grew, and 66% reported no change in fertilizer or pesticide use. The study has its limitations, however, including low response rates in several major agricultural states, as well as possible self-reporting bias. Further studies will be needed to better understand medium- and long-term changes in crop cultivation practices as well as the use of chemical inputs.</p>

<p>According to the authors, &ldquo;Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find an association between COVID-19 and changes in crop cultivation patterns or interest in trying agroecological practices. However, although most farmers continued to grow the same crops with no change in input use, many expressed an interest in learning more about practicing more sustainable farming. These findings will inform future directions for resilient agri-food systems&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Jaacks adds, &ldquo;Despite disruptions to agri-food supply chains during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, and about 1 in 5 farmers in our national sample reporting COVID-19 symptoms in the past month, the vast majority of farmers continued with prevailing cropping patterns. Rice remained the dominant crop in Kharif (monsoon season) of 2020, and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides continued. Government support, peer-to-peer training networks, and market linkage support will be required to shift farmers to more nutrient-dense and sustainable cropping patterns.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-asteroids-dinosaurs-impact-crater-nadir">Not one, but two asteroids might have slain the dinosaurs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chicxulub, the asteroid that wiped out most dinosaurs, might have had a little sibling.</p>



<p>Off the coast of West Africa, hundreds of meters beneath the seafloor, scientists have identified what appears to be the remains of an <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn3096">8.5-kilometer-wide impact crater</a>, which they’ve named Nadir. The team estimates that the crater formed roughly around the same time that another asteroid — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">Chicxulub</a>, the dinosaur killer — slammed into modern day Mexico (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>). If confirmed, it could mean that nonbird dinosaurs met their demise by a one-two punch of asteroids, researchers report in the Aug. 17 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>“The idea that [Chicxulub] had help — for want of a better phrase — would have really added insult to serious injury,” says study coauthor Veronica Bray, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/erosion-has-erased-most-earth-impact-craters-here-are-survivors">200 impact craters</a> have been discovered on Earth (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>), the vast majority of which are on land. That’s because impact craters at sea gradually become buried under sediment, Bray says, which makes the Nadir structure a valuable scientific find, regardless of its birthdate.</p>



<p>Geologist Uisdean Nicholson of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh happened upon the structure while analyzing data collected by seismic waves transmitted underground to detect physical structures offshore of Guinea. Lurking beneath the seafloor — and under nearly 1 kilometer of water — he discerned a bowl-shaped structure with a broken-up, terraced floor and a pronounced central peak — features expected of a large impact.</p>



<p>Based on the structure’s dimensions, Bray, Nicholson and their colleagues calculate that, if an asteroid was responsible for the terrain, it would probably have been over 400 meters wide. What’s more, the researchers estimate that the impact would have rocked the ground like a magnitude 7 earthquake and stirred tsunamis hundreds of meters high.</p>



<p>Despite that fallout, the Nadir impact would have been far less devastating than the one from the roughly 10-kilometer-wide Chicxulub asteroid, says Michael Rampino, a geologist from New York University who was not involved in the study. “It certainly wouldn&#8217;t have had global effects,” he says.</p>



<p>Using geologic layers adjacent to Nadir, some with ages obtained by past studies, the team estimated the structure to have formed around the end of the Cretaceous period — 66 million years ago. The Nadir asteroid may even have formed a pair with the Chicxulub asteroid, the two having been ripped apart by gravitational forces during a previous Earth flyby, the researchers speculate.</p>

<p>But the study’s conclusions have some experts wary. “It looks like an impact crater, but it could also be something else,” says geologist Philippe Claeys of Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, who was not involved in the research. Confirming that the structure is an impact crater will require drilling for solid evidence, such as shocked quartz, he says. Alternative explanations for the structure’s identity include a collapsed volcanic caldera or a squeezed body of salt called a salt diapir.</p>



<p>The Nadir structure’s age is another uncertainty. The seismic data shows it appears to have formed sometime near the end the Cretaceous period&nbsp; or maybe a little later, Claeys says. “But that&#8217;s around the best they can say.” Drilling in the crater for minerals that contain radioactive elements could provide a more precise date of formation, Rampino says.</p>



<p>It’s not the first time that scientists have investigated whether Chicxulub had an accomplice. Some studies have suggested that the Boltysh crater in Ukraine <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00875.x">may have formed at the same time as Chicxulub</a>, though researchers have since determined that Boltysh formed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe6530">650,000 years later</a>.</p>



<p>Bray and her colleagues are currently negotiating for funding to collect samples from the crater, with aspirations to drill in 2024. That will hopefully settle some of the debate surrounding Nadir’s origins, Bray says, though new questions will probably arise too. “If we do prove that this is the sister of the dinosaur killer, then how many other siblings are there?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-urchin-skeletons-patterns-structure">Sea urchin skeletons’ splendid patterns may strengthen their structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sea urchin skeletons may owe some of their strength to a common geometric design.</p>



<p>Components of the skeletons of common sea urchins (<em>Paracentrotus lividus</em>) follow a similar pattern to that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2022.0226">found in honeycombs</a> and dragonfly wings, researchers report in the August <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. Studying this recurring natural order could inspire the creation of strong yet lightweight new materials.</p>



<p>Urchin skeletons display “an incredible diversity of structures at the microscale, varying from fully ordered to entirely chaotic,” says marine biologist and biomimetic consultant Valentina Perricone. These structures may help the animals maintain their shape when faced with predator attacks and environmental stresses.</p>



<p>While using a scanning electron microscope to study urchin skeleton tubercules — sites where the spines attach that withstand strong mechanical forces — Perricone spotted “a curious regularity.” Tubercules seem to follow a type of common natural order called a Voronoi pattern, she and her colleagues found.</p>

<p>Using math, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-math-helps-explain-delicate-patterns-dragonfly-wings">Voronoi pattern</a> is created by a process that divides a region into polygon-shaped cells that are built around points within them called seeds (<em>SN: 9/23/18</em>). The cells follow the nearest neighbor rule: Every spot inside a cell is nearer to that cell’s seed than to any other seed. Also, the boundary that separates two cells is equidistant from both their seeds.</p>



<p>A computer-generated Voronoi pattern had an 82 percent match with the pattern found in sea urchin skeletons. This arrangement, the team suspects, yields a strong yet lightweight skeletal structure. The pattern “can be interpreted as an evolutionary solution” that “optimizes the skeleton,” says Perricone, of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli” in Aversa, Italy.</p>



<p>Urchins, dragonflies and bees aren’t the only beneficiaries of Voronoi architecture. “We are developing a library of bioinspired, Voronoi-based structures” that could “serve as lightweight and resistant solutions” for materials design, Perricone says. These, she hopes, could inspire new developments in materials science, aerospace, architecture and construction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-climate-reptile-evolution-permian-extinction">Extreme climate shifts long ago may have helped drive reptile evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s nothing like a big mass extinction to open up ecological niches and clear out the competition, accelerating evolution for some lucky survivors. Or is there? A new study suggests that the rate of climate change may play just as large a role in speeding up evolution.</p>



<p>The study focuses on reptile evolution across 57 million years — before, during and after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">the mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian Period (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>)<em>.</em> That extinction event, triggered by carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere and oceans through increased volcanic activity about 252 million years ago, knocked out a whopping 86 percent of Earth’s species. Yet reptiles recovered from the chaos relatively well. Their exploding diversity of species around that time has been widely regarded as a result of their slithering into newly available niches.</p>





<p>But rapid climate fluctuations were already taking place much earlier in the Permian, and so were surges of reptile diversification, researchers say. Analyzing fossils from 125 reptile species shows that bursts of evolutionary diversity in reptiles <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq1898">were tightly correlated with relatively rapid fluctuations in climate</a> throughout the Permian and millions of years into the next geologic period, the Triassic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists’ understanding of evolution is expanding as they become more tuned into the connection between it and environmental change, says Jessica Whiteside, a geologist at the University of Southampton in England who works on mass extinctions but was not involved in the new work. “This study is bound to become an important part of that conversation.”</p>



<p>To investigate reptile evolution, evolutionary paleobiologist Tiago Simões of Harvard University and colleagues precisely measured and scanned reptile fossils ranging from 294 million to 237 million years old. In all, the researchers examined 1,000 specimens at 50 research institutions in 20 countries.  For climate data, the team used an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25019-2">existing large database of sea surface temperatures</a> based on oxygen isotope data, extending back 450 million years, published in 2021.</p>



<p>By closely tracking changes in body and head size and shape in so many species, paired with that climate data, the researchers found that the faster the rate of climate change, the faster reptiles evolved. The fastest rate of reptile diversification did not occur at the end-Permian extinction, the team found, but several million years later in the Triassic, when climate change was at its most rapid and global temperatures witheringly hot. Ocean surface temperatures during this time soared to 40° Celsius, or 104⁰ Fahrenheit — about the temperature of a hot tub, says Simões.</p>



<p>A few species did evolve less rapidly than their kin, Simões says. The difference? Size. For instance, reptiles with smaller body sizes are already preadapted to live in rapidly warming climates, he says. Due to their greater surface area to body ratio, “small-bodied reptiles can better exchange heat with their surrounding environment,” so stay relatively cooler than larger animals.</p>



<p>“The smaller reptiles were basically being forced by natural selection to stay the same, while during that same period of time, the large reptiles were being told by natural selection ‘You need to change right away or you’re going to go extinct,’” Simões says.</p>



<p>This phenomenon, called the Lilliput effect, is not a new proposal, Simões says, adding that it’s been well established in marine organisms. “But it’s the first time it’s been quantified&nbsp;in limbed vertebrates across this critical period in Earth&#8217;s history.”</p>



<p>Simões and colleagues’ detailed work has refined the complex evolutionary tree for reptiles and their ancestors. But, for now, it’s unclear which played a bigger role in reptile evolution long ago — all those open ecological niches after the end-Permian mass extinction, or the dramatic climate fluctuations outside of the extinction event.</p>



<p>“We cannot say which one was more important,” Simões says. “Without either one, the course of evolution in the Triassic and the rise of reptiles to global dominance in terrestrial ecosystems would have been quite different.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">The new CDC guidelines may make back-to-school harder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across the United States, kids are prepping for back-to-school, or are already in classrooms, and parents are buckling up for another pandemic school year. Like me, many are trying to get a handle on what COVID-19 precautions to take. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html">Updated guidance</a> released last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t exactly helped. It may have made dealing with back-to-school more confusing — and could even spur new outbreaks.</p>



<p>Last November, my fifth grader had to quarantine at home for 10 days after a close contact tested positive. Now, the CDC has nixed the quarantine recommendation for people exposed to COVID-19. Today, our situation could look something like this: My COVID-exposed daughter would mask for 10 days, test on day five, and remain in school the whole time — only the infected child would isolate. That child would stay home for at least five days after a positive test. Then, if the child is fever-free and symptoms are improving, according to the new guidance, they could pop on a mask and hightail it back to class — no testing needed.</p>





<p>That advice could mean more COVID-19 in classrooms. Scientists have shown that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20Centers%20for%20Disease,by%205%20days%20of%20masking.">people can remain infectious after day five</a>. So without testing for COVID-19, students and teachers won’t know if they’re bringing the disease back to school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the same day the CDC’s guidance came out, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added yet another wrinkle. If you think you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 but test negative with an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, the FDA now recommends testing again … and again. Repeat testing over time cuts the chances <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">you’ll miss an infection and unknowingly spread the virus</a>, the FDA advised on August 11.</p>



<p>It’s hard to say how that advice jibes with the CDC’s new, more-relaxed guidelines. Even the agency has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/politics/cdc-rochelle-walensky-covid.html">said its public guidance during the pandemic</a> has been “confusing and overwhelming,” the <em>New York Times</em> reports. CDC director Rochelle Walensky is now planning a shake-up that could include restructuring the communications office as well as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/17/1117904729/cdc-reorganization-walensky-covid">relying more on preliminary studies rather than waiting for research to go through peer-review</a>, according to NPR.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, the CDC released new COVID-19 guidelines. Now, some parents are wondering what that means for back-to-school. How do you feel about the changes?</p>&mdash; Science News (@ScienceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The CDC’s new guidance has sparked a range of reactions, many negative, among scientists, doctors, parents and teachers. In an informal <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?s=20&amp;t=r-37z-05BafAr-Cg5-dFvg">Twitter poll of <em>Science News</em> followers</a>, roughly 80 percent of the 353 respondents reported that the new CDC guidance made them feel confused, worried or angry and/or exasperated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it’s up to local school districts to decide what COVID-19 measures to take. “Just because guidance has changed <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-presidents-statement-new-cdc-guidelines">does not mean COVID is gone</a>,” Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association labor union, said in a statement. Not by a long shot. The United States is currently averaging nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">500 daily coronavirus deaths</a> and more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases_select_00">100,000 new cases a day</a>, an almost certain undercount.</p>



<p>As my own children gear up for school, I wonder about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">COVID-19’s constantly shifting landscape</a>. Like other families with school-aged children, we’ve bounced from virtual school to in-person mask mandates to mask-optional recommendations. And we still don’t know our district’s plans for the upcoming year. School starts in about a week.</p>



<p>There is reason for hope, though: We know what measures can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions"> slow COVID-19’s spread </a>in schools. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">Masking is a big one</a>. A preliminary study posted August 9 linked <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1.full-text">lifting school mask mandates</a> in Boston-area K–12 schools with a rise in cases among students and staff. At Boston University, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794964">mandatory masking plus a vaccine mandate</a> seemed to keep the virus in check in classrooms, scientists reported August 5 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Testing can help, too. A computer analysis from England suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.211985">regularly rapid testing students can curb classroom transmission</a>, scientists report August 10 in the <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>. </p>

<p>But knowing what works is not the same as actually employing evidence-based measures in the classroom, says Anne Sosin, a public health researcher at Dartmouth College whose research focuses on COVID-19 and rural health equity. She has studied how pandemic policies have impacted schools in northern New England. “I worry that we simply have not seen the political leadership to ensure that all children and educators can safely participate in school.”</p>



<p>I spoke with Sosin about the CDC’s new guidance, and what kids and parents might expect heading into the new school year. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do you think of the updated guidance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin: </strong>I was very disappointed that the CDC did not adopt a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-school-works-coronavirus-pandemic-reopening">test-to-exit-isolation</a> recommendation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we’re going to see in schools are infected students and educators returning after five days still positive for COVID-19. Multiple studies have demonstrated that most people are infectious beyond five days. Not only is it highly likely that they’ll be seeding outbreaks. They’ll also be putting high-risk members of school communities in danger.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What could the guidance mean for vulnerable kids?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: I think that vulnerable people are going to be in a very precarious situation. The guidance mentions the need to ensure protections for immunocompromised and other high-risk people but there’s a problem of implementation. Will schools actually implement those protections?</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Do scientists have a good handle on what protections can help?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Definitely. We have really strong evidence showing that when layered mitigation strategies are in place, we can almost eliminate transmission in school settings. That means that we should have upgraded ventilation, lunchroom strategies [like taking kids outside to eat] and testing. And I continue to think that data-driven mask policies have a role to play. Not masking forever, but masking at times when we see an uptick in transmission.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> How could the new guidance affect different communities across the United States?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Different communities have not only been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">impacted in dramatically different ways</a>, but they’re also on unequal footing at this stage of the pandemic.</p>



<p>[If we compare white communities with communities of color], we see disparities in vaccination coverage and caregiver loss. Some communities have suffered enormous losses while others have really been untouched. <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/6/e2021053760/183446/COVID-19-Associated-Orphanhood-and-Caregiver-Death">Black children have lost caregivers</a> at more than two times the rate of white children. For Indigenous children, the rate is 4.5 times as high. Those are sharp disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communities of color also have less access to testing, treatment and health care. I worry that if we don’t have a renewed focus on equity, then we’re just going to see an exacerbation of disparities that have existed throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What advice do you have for parents as they head into the new school year?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: We all want as normal a school year as possible. Masking should be one of the tools we’re ready to employ to keep our kids in the classroom. In addition, we should be advocating that our schools invest in ventilation. Vaccination also represents a critical piece of the strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see such abysmal vaccination coverage among children. <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">Less than 1 in 3 kids ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated</a>. I think many parents no longer see it as important — there’s been this narrative that the pandemic is over. We need clear messaging that vaccination remains an important tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is a great time to plan back-to-school campaigns to vaccinate kids and to begin to prepare for the arrival of omicron-specific boosters in the fall.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691197579">The Five-Million-Year Odyssey<br></a><em>Peter Bellwood<br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</em></p>



<p>Archaeologist Peter Bellwood’s academic odyssey wended from England to teaching posts halfway around the world, first in New Zealand and then in Australia. For more than 50 years, he has studied how humans settled islands from Southeast Asia to Polynesia.</p>



<p>So it’s fitting that his new book, a plain-English summary of what’s known and what’s not about the evolution of humans and our ancestors, emphasizes movement. In <em>The</em> <em>Five-Million-Year Odyssey</em>, Bellwood examines a parade of species in the human evolutionary family — he collectively refers to them as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">hominins, whereas some others (including <em>Science News</em>) use the term hominids</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/21</em>) — and tracks their migrations across land and sea. He marshals evidence indicating that hominids in motion continually shifted the direction of biological and cultural evolution.</p>





<p>Throughout his tour, Bellwood presents his own take on contested topics. But when available evidence leaves a debate unresolved, he says so. Consider the earliest hominids. Species from at least 4.4 million years ago or more whose hominid status is controversial, such as <em>Ardipithecus ramidus</em>, get a brief mention. Bellwood renders no verdict on whether those finds come from early hominids or ancient apes. He focuses instead on African australopithecines, a set of upright but partly apelike species thought to have included populations that evolved into members of our own genus, <em>Homo</em>, around 2.5 million to 3 million years ago. Bellwood hammers home the point that stone-tool making by the last australopithecines, the first <em>Homo</em> groups or both contributed to the evolution of bigger brains in our ancestors.</p>



<p>The action speeds up when <em>Homo erectus </em>becomes the first known hominid to leave Africa, roughly 2 million years ago. Questions remain, Bellwood writes, about how many such migrations occurred and whether this humanlike species reached distant islands such as Flores in Indonesia, perhaps giving rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought">small hominids called hobbits, or <em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>). What’s clear is that <em>H. erectus </em>groups journeyed across mainland Asia and at least as far as the Indonesian island of Java.</p>



<p>Intercontinental migrations flourished after <em>Homo sapiens</em> debuted, around 300,000 years ago in Africa. Bellwood regards <em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans as distinct species that interbred in certain parts of Asia and Europe. He suggests that Neandertals disappeared around 40,000 years ago as they mated with members of more numerous <em>H. sapiens</em> populations, leaving a genetic legacy in people today. But he does not address an opposing argument that different <em>Homo</em> populations at this time, including Neandertals, were too closely related to have been separate species and that it was<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals"> intermittent mating among these mobile groups</a> that drove the evolution of present-day humans (<em>SN: 6/5/21</em>).</p>



<p>Bellwood gives considerable attention to the rise of food production and domestication in Europe and Asia after around 9,000 years ago. He builds on an argument, derived from his 2004 book <em>First Farmers</em>, that expanding populations of early cultivators migrated to new lands in such great numbers that they spread major language families with them. For instance, farmers in what’s now Turkey spread Indo-European languages into much of Europe sometime after roughly 8,000 years ago, Bellwood contends.</p>



<p>He rejects a recent alternative proposal, based on ancient DNA evidence, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">horse-riding herders of Central Asia’s Yamnaya</a> culture brought their traditions and Indo-European tongues to Europe around 5,000 years ago (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>). Too few Yamnaya immigrated to impose a new language on European communities, Bellwood says. Similarly, he argues, ancient Eurasian conquerors, from Alexander the Great to Roman emperors, couldn’t get speakers of regional languages to adopt new ones spoken by their outnumbered military masters.</p>



<p>Bellwood rounds out his evolutionary odyssey with a reconstruction of how early agricultural populations expanded through East Asia and beyond, to Australia, a string of Pacific islands and the Americas. Between about 4,000 and 750 years ago, for instance, sea-faring farmers spread Austronesian languages from southern China and Taiwan to Madagascar in the west and Polynesia in the east. Precisely how they accomplished that remarkable feat remains a puzzle.</p>



<p>Disappointingly, Bellwood doesn’t weigh in on a recent archaeological argument that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-history-society-dawn-of-everything-book">ancient societies were more flexible and complex than long assumed</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/21</em>). On the plus side, his evolutionary odyssey moves along at a brisk pace and, like our ancestors, covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall winner captures something like out of science fiction &#8211; the fruiting body of a parasitic fungus erupting from the body of a fly. Roberto García-Roa, an evolutionary biologist and conservation photographer affiliated with the University of Valencia (Spain) and Lund University (Sweden), captured this unsettling image in the Peruvian jungle of Tambopata. Roberto explains that “spores of the so-called ‘Zombie’ fungus (e.g. genera </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ophiocordyceps</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) infect arthropods by infiltrating their exoskeleton and minds. As a result, parasitized hosts are compelled to migrate to a more favourable location for the fungus’s growth. Here, they await death, at which point the fungus feeds on its host to produce fruiting bodies full of spores that will be jettisoned to infect more victims &#8211; a conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution.” Senior Editorial Board Member Christy Anna Hipsley comments that this image depicting a parasite-host interaction “has a depth and composition that conveys life and death simultaneously &#8211; an affair that transcends time, space, and even species. The death of the fly gives life to the fungus”. </span></p>

<p>Alwin Hardenbol from the University of Eastern Finland, Finland took the winning image for the Relationships in Nature category. The photograph depicts a Bohemian Waxwing feasting on fermented rowan berries, demonstrating the strong relationship between the species. The presence of rowan berries influences the migration of waxwings, which can eat several hundred berries per day and have evolved larger livers in order to process ethanol produced by fermenting berries.</p>

<p>The Biodiversity Under Threat category winner was captured by Samantha Kreling from the University of Washington, USA, and shows African elephants sheltering from the Sun under a large baobab tree in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa as droughts strike. Samantha Kreling said: “Baobab trees can live for more than 2,000 years and store water in their barrel-like trunks when water is scarce. The tree in this image has had its bark stripped by elephants seeking water. Although these trees are usually fast-healing, this damage is more than baobab trees can cope with as temperatures rise due to climate change. This photograph highlights the need for action to prevent the permanent loss of these iconic trees.”</p>

A false spring &#8211; climate change threatens wood frog offspring. Attribution: Lindsey Swierk.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lindsey Swierk, an Assistant Research Professor at Binghamton University (State University of New York), submitted the runner-up for this category. Spring in the northeastern United States is arriving earlier and becoming more variable in temperature. This change poses a threat to many spring-breeding amphibians, including wood frogs. Lindsey explains, &#8220;Wood frogs (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rana sylvatica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) are early spring breeders in temperate North America. Lately, wood frogs are breeding earlier in the year as climate change unseasonably warms early spring in the Northeastern USA. Unfortunately, winter storms can still catch frogs unexpectedly and trap them under the ice. Here, a male wood frog clings to an egg mass produced before a freeze; both the egg mass and the frog were recently trapped under ice. The frog survived, but many of the eggs did not.&#8221; Senior Editorial Board Member Josef Settele comments, &#8220;I think it is important to realise that effects of major drivers of biodiversity change can also happen in counter-intuitive ways. In the present case, due to climate warming, there is an increased risk of the frog offspring dying because of cold/freezing (due to severe changes in phenology).&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The Life Close Up category winner depicts gliding treefrog embryos developing within their eggs in the Osa Penninsula, Costa Rica and was taken by Brandon André Güell from Boston University, USA. Brandon André Güell said: “The eggs in this image were laid by thousands of gliding treefrogs during an explosive breeding event triggered by a torrential rainstorm. If undisturbed, these eggs will hatch after six days of development, however the embryos can hatch early in order to escape threats such as predators and flooding.”</p>

They can spend almost 20 minutes underwater, inhaling and exhaling a bubble of air that clings to their snout. Oxygen from this bubble is depleted over the underwater dive, which likely helps water anoles remain underwater for so long.”</span></p>

Jeferson Ribeiro Amaral said: “The researchers in this image are representative of so many others who carried on working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This image demonstrates their strength and dedication to understanding our world as they carry out their work despite thunderstorms and a global pandemic.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-fungus-body-fly-photo-contest">An award-winning photo captures a ‘zombie’ fungus erupting from a fly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sometimes a photo is literally a matter of life, death — and zombies.</p>



<p>This haunting image, winner of the 2022 <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> photography competition, certainly fits that description. It captures the fruiting bodies of a parasitic fungus, emerging from the lifeless body of an infected fly in the Peruvian rainforest.</p>



<p>The fungus-infested fly was one of many images submitted to the contest from all over the world, aiming to showcase the beauty of the natural world and the challenges it faces. The journal <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-022-02049-y">revealed the winners</a> August 18.</p>





<p>Roberto García-Roa, a conservation photographer and evolutionary biologist at the University of Valencia in Spain, took the winning photo while visiting the Tambopata National Reserve, a protected habitat in the Amazon.</p>



<p>The fungus erupting from the fly belongs to the genus <em>Ophiocordyceps, </em>a diverse collection of parasitic fungi known as “zombie fungi,” due to their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">ability to infect insects and control their minds</a> (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>“There is still much to unravel about the diversity of these fungi as it is likely that each insect species infected succumbs to its own, specialized fungus,” says Charissa de Bekker, an expert in parasitic fungi at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>First, spores of the fungus land on the ill-fated fly. So begins the manipulative endgame. The spores infiltrate the fly’s exoskeleton before infecting its body and eventually hijacking its mind. Once in control, the fungus uses its new powers of locomotion to relocate to a microclimate more suitable to its own growth — somewhere with the right temperature, light and moisture.</p>



<p>Fungus and fly then bide their time until the fly dies, becoming a food source for the fungus to consume. Fruiting bodies work their way out of the fly, filled with spores that are released into the air to continue the macabre cycle in a new, unsuspecting host. It is a “conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution,” García-Roa said in a statement announcing the winners.</p>



<p>Research into the molecular aspects of fungal mind control is under way, De Bekker says, including in her own lab. “These fungi harbor all sorts of bioactive chemicals that we have yet to characterize and that could have novel medicinal and pest control applications.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-degrade-lye-chemistry">Common, cheap ingredients can break down some ‘forever chemicals’</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a new way to rip apart harmful “forever chemicals,” scientists say.</p>



<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are found in nonstick pans, water-repellent fabrics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost">food packaging</a> and they are pervasive throughout the environment. They’re nicknamed forever chemicals for their ability to stick around and not break down. In part, that’s because PFAS have a super strong bond between their carbon and fluorine atoms (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>). Now, using a bit of heat and two relatively common compounds, researchers have <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8868">degraded one major type of forever chemical in the lab</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 19 <em>Science.</em> The work could help pave the way for a process for breaking down certain forever chemicals commercially, for instance by treating wastewater.</p>





<p>“The fundamental knowledge of how the materials degrade is the single most important thing coming out of this study,” organic chemist William Dichtel said in an August 16 news conference.</p>



<p>While some scientists have found relatively simple ways of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-uv-iodide-perfluoroalkyl-polyfluoroalkyl-sulfite">breaking down select PFAS</a>, most degradation methods require harsh, energy-intensive processes using intense pressure — in some cases over 22 megapascals — or extremely high temperatures — sometimes upwards of 1000⁰ Celsius — to break the chemical bonds<em> (SN: 6/3/22)</em>.</p>



<p>Dichtel, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and his team experimented with two substances found in nearly every chemistry lab cabinet: sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, and a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO. The team worked specifically with a group of forever chemicals called PFCAs, which contain carboxylic acid and constitute a large percentage of all PFAS. Some of these&nbsp;kinds of forever chemicals are found in water-resistant clothes.</p>



<p>When the team combined PFCAs with the lye and DMSO at 120⁰ C and with no extra pressure needed, the carboxylic acid fell off the chemical and became carbon dioxide in a process called decarboxylation. What happened next was unexpected, Dichtel said. Loss of the acid led to a process causing “the entire molecule to fall apart in a cascade of complex reactions.&#8221; This cascade involved steps that degraded the rest of the chemical into fluoride ions and smaller carbon-containing products, leaving behind virtually no harmful by-products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>



<p>“It’s a neat method, it’s different from other ones that have been tried,” says Chris Sales, an environmental engineer at Drexel University in Philadelphia who was not involved in the study. “The biggest question is, how could this be adapted and scaled up?” Northwestern has filed a provisional patent on behalf of the researchers.</p>



<p>Understanding this mechanism is just one step in undoing forever chemicals, Dichtel’s team said. And more research is needed: There are other classes of PFAS that require their own solutions. This process wouldn&#8217;t work to tackle PFAS out in the environment, because it requires a concentrated amount of the chemicals. But it could one day be used in wastewater treatment plants, where the pollutants could be filtered out of the water, concentrated and then broken down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-smell-humans-odor-aedes-aegypti">Why mosquitoes are especially good at smelling you</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some mosquitoes have a near-foolproof thirst for human blood. Previous attempts to prevent the insects from tracking people down by blocking part of mosquitoes’ ability to smell have failed. A new study hints it’s because the bloodsuckers have built-in workarounds to ensure they can always smell us.</p>



<p>For most animals, individual nerve cells in the olfactory system can detect just one type of odor. But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.024"><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes’ nerve cells can each detect many</a> smells, researchers report August 18 in <em>Cell</em>. That means if a cell were to lose the ability to detect one human odor, it still can pick up on other scents.</p>





<p>The study provides the most detailed map yet of a mosquito’s sense of smell and suggests that concealing human aromas from the insects could be more complicated than researchers thought.</p>



<p>Repellents that block mosquitoes from detecting human-associated scents could be especially tricky to make. “Maybe instead of trying to mask them from finding us, it would be better to find odorants that mosquitoes don’t like to smell,” says Anandasankar Ray, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Riverside who was not involved in the work. Such repellents may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-gets-deets-deet">confuse</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-catnip-plant-repels-insects-mosquitoes-chemical-receptor">irritate</a> the bloodsuckers and send them flying away (<em>SN: 9/21/11; SN: 3/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>Effective repellents are a key tool to prevent mosquitoes from transmitting disease-causing viruses such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scent-zika-dengue-infection-mosquito-lure-acetophenone">dengue and Zika</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). “Mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other creature,” says Olivia Goldman, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City. “The better we understand them, the better that we can have these interventions.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Mosquitoes that feed on people home in on a variety of cues when hunting, including body heat and body odor. The insects smell using their antennae and small appendages close to the mouth. Using three types of sensors in olfactory nerve cells, they can detect chemicals such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-luck-outsmarting-mosquito">carbon dioxide</a> from exhaled breath or components of body odor (<em>SN: 7/16/15</em>). </p>



<p>In previous work, researchers thought that blocking some sensors might <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/targeting-single-set-nerve-cells-may-block-mosquitoes">hide human scents</a> from mosquitoes by disrupting the smell messages sent to the brain (<em>SN: 12/5/13</em>). But even those sensor-deprived mosquitoes can still smell and bite people, says neurobiologist Margo Herre also of Rockefeller University.</p>



<p>So Goldman, Herre and colleagues added fluorescent labels to <em>A. aegypti </em>nerve cells, or neurons, to learn new details about how the mosquito brain deciphers human odors. Surprisingly, rather than finding the typical single type of sensor per nerve cell, the team found that individual mosquito neurons appear more like sensory hubs.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses confirmed that some of the olfactory nerve cells had more than one type of sensor. Some cells produced electrical signals in response to several mosquito-attracting chemicals found in humans such as octenol and triethyl amine — a sign the neurons could detect more than one type of odor molecule. A separate study published in April in <em>eLife</em> found <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72599">&nbsp;similar results in fruit flies</a>, which suggests such a system may be common among insects.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why having redundant ways of detecting people’s odors might be useful to mosquitoes. “Different people can smell very different from one another,” says study coauthor Meg Younger, a neurobiologist at Boston University. “Maybe this is a setup to find a human regardless of what variety of human body odor that human is emitting.”</p>

<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with that aim to create lasting change in the ways science is communicated</strong>?</p>



<p>In my time at PLOS, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of launching several new business models &mdash; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-iii-flat-fees/">Flat Fees</a>, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a> &mdash; that enable more authors to publish open access and engage with open science best practice without paying fees. These models reduce the &ldquo;barrier to entry&rdquo; for researchers from many different backgrounds who do not have the funds to pay APCs. And essentially prove that there is more than one way to cover the cost of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>To&nbsp; echo what George and Emily have mentioned in their <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-ensuring-fair-opportunities-for-all-authors/">post</a>, I think we create more/better science when as many voices as possible can participate &mdash; at the level and the moment that&rsquo;s appropriate for them. Open Access created more opportunities for more people to interact with science when and how it&rsquo;s most meaningful to them. A secondary school teacher interested in new methodologies to support students with special needs in the classroom has a very different level of expertise/accessibility to research than a PhD student. Open Access levels that playing field. But we still need more creative solutions to ensure every <em>author </em>can make their work open if they choose, which is what these models aim to do.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important because science is a global, interdisciplinary enterprise. We risk losing vital voices when structural barriers &mdash; like cost &mdash; prevent a researcher from participating in that enterprise. Though we still have a lot of work ahead of us&ndash;much more to improve and to learn about how we can create solutions that work for all authors&ndash;this is a first step in thinking about Open Access differently. These models are leading the way in opening our own PLOS journals to all authors, as well as pushing other publishers &mdash; and academic institutions more broadly&ndash; to think more expansively about what it means to further inclusion in scholarly communication.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>Researchers dedicate their lives and livelihood to doing important work in their communities. If our work to make Open Access publishing more inclusive makes it possible for even <em>one </em>more voice to be heard, amplified, and shared, our work is a success. But we can and mustdo better than just one. PLOS is a global publisher, with a growing portfolio of journals that reach all areas of science and medicine. We have the capacity to make bold changes that reverberate across the scholarly community and lead by example. To be at the forefront of this work and see the pressure it puts on our peers across the industry to make lasting change is extremely gratifying. I&rsquo;m very lucky to part of it.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution</strong>?</p>



<p>In short, that it changed the way scholarly communication looked at the economics of authorship and participation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oort-cloud-comets-spin-death">Oort cloud comets may spin themselves to death</a></h4>

              
                <p>Comets from the solar system’s deep freezer often don’t survive their first encounter with the sun. Now one scientist thinks he knows why: Solar warmth makes some of the cosmic snowballs spin so fast, they fall apart.</p>



<p>This suggestion could help solve a decades-old mystery about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04469">what destroys many “long-period” comets</a>, astronomer David Jewitt reports in a study submitted August 8 to arXiv.org. Long-period comets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-object-points-remote-solar-system-reservoir">originate in the Oort cloud</a>, a sphere of icy objects at the solar system’s fringe (<em>SN: 8/18/08</em>). Those that survive their first trip around the sun tend to swing by our star only once every 200 years.</p>





<p>“These things are stable out there in the Oort cloud where nothing ever happens. When they come toward the sun, they heat up, all hell breaks loose, and they fall apart,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>The Dutch astronomer Jan Oort first proposed the Oort cloud as a cometary reservoir in 1950. He realized that many of its comets that came near Earth were first-time visitors, not return travelers. Something was taking the comets out, but no one knew what.</p>



<p>One possibility was that the comets die by sublimating all of their water away as they near the heat of the sun until there’s nothing left. But that didn’t fit with observations of comets that seemed to physically break up into smaller pieces. The trouble was, those breakups are hard to watch in real time.</p>



<p>“The disintegrations are really hard to observe because they’re unpredictable, and they happen quickly,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>He ran into that difficulty when he tried to observe Comet Leonard, a bright comet that put on a spectacular show in winter 2021–2022. Jewitt had applied for time to observe the comet with the Hubble Space Telescope in April and June 2022. But by February, the comet had already disintegrated. “That was a wake-up call,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>So Jewitt turned to historical observations of long-period comets that came close to the sun since the year 2000. He selected those whose water vapor production had been indirectly measured via an instrument called <a href="http://swan.projet.latmos.ipsl.fr/">SWAN on NASA’s SOHO spacecraft</a>, to see how quickly the comets were losing mass. He also picked out comets whose movements deviating from their orbits around the sun had been measured. Those motions are a result of water vapor jets pushing the comet around, like a spraying hose flopping around a garden.</p>



<p>That left him with 27 comets, seven of which did not survive their closest approach to the sun.</p>



<p>Jewitt expected that the most active comets would disintegrate the fastest, by puffing away all their water. But he found the opposite: It turns out that the least active comets with the smallest dirty snowball cores were the most at risk of falling apart.</p>



<p>“Basically, being a small nucleus near the sun causes you to die,” Jewitt says. “The question is, why?”</p>



<p>It wasn’t that the comets were torn apart by the sun’s gravity — they didn’t get close enough for that. And simply sublimating until they went poof would have been too slow a death to match the observations. The comets are also unlikely to collide with anything else in the vastness of space and break apart that way. And a previous suggestion that pressure builds up inside the comets until they explode like a hand grenade doesn’t make sense to Jewitt. Comets’ upper few centimeters of material would absorb most of the sun’s heat, he says, so it would be difficult to heat the center of the comet enough for that to work.</p>



<p>The best remaining explanation, Jewitt says, is rotational breakup. As the comet nears the sun and its water heats up enough to sublimate, jets of water vapor form and make the core start to spin like a catherine wheel firework. Smaller cores are easier to push around than a larger one, so they spin more easily.</p>



<p>“It just spins faster and faster, until it doesn’t have enough tensile strength to hold together,” Jewitt says. “I’m pretty sure that’s what’s happening.”</p>



<p>That deadly spin speed is actually quite slow. Spinning at about half a meter per second could spell curtains for a kilometer-sized comet, he calculates. “You can walk faster.”</p>



<p>But comets are fragile. If you held a fist-sized comet in front of your face, a sneeze would destroy it, says planetary astronomer Nalin Samarasinha of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Samarasinha thinks Jewitt’s proposal is convincing. “Even though the sample size is small, I think it is something really happening.” But other things might be destroying these comets too, he says, and Jewitt agrees.</p>



<p>Samarasinha is holding out for more comet observations, which could come when the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera Rubin Observatory</a> begins surveying the sky in 2023. Jewitt’s idea “is something which can be observationally tested in a decade or two.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-dog-infection-animal-spillover">The first known monkeypox infection in a pet dog hints at spillover risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first recorded case of a person passing monkeypox to a dog could be a harbinger of other animals catching the sometimes disfiguring and deadly virus. If that happens, monkeypox could establish animal reservoirs outside of Africa for the first time.</p>



<p>Two men in France appear to have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01487-8/fulltext#%20">spread monkeypox to their Italian greyhound</a>, researchers report August 10 in the <em>Lancet</em>. The men reported letting the dog sleep in bed with them.</p>



<p>Monkeypox can spread through skin-to-skin contact, such as the intimate contact that happens during sex. Even more casual contact such as <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1191_article">dancing in close confines</a> can spread the virus, an Aug. 15 study in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> suggests. So can contact with objects an infected person has used, including bedding and clothing. Infectious monkeypox viruses <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1047_article">linger more often on such soft, porous materials</a> than on hard surfaces, researchers report August 11 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. Some 60 percent of soft goods and 5 percent of hard surfaces tested still carried viable virus for at least 15 days, the team found. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In the case of the dog, the animal developed pustules about 12 days after its owners reported symptoms. Viral DNA from one of the men matched that from the dog, suggesting that the human had given monkeypox to an animal.</p>



<p>Usually monkeypox goes the other way, from animals — especially rodents in some parts of Africa — to people in “spillover,” or zoonotic, infections. “This is a classic case of reverse zoonoses,” or spillback, in which a viral disease hops from humans back into animals, says Grant McFadden, a pox virologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>Such spillback events are fairly common with other viruses; people are known to have given COVID-19 to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-dog-pet-hong-kong-infection">dogs</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-animals-pets-coronavirus-covid19">cats</a> and zoo animals, for instance (<em>SN: 3/5/20; SN: 3/31/20</em>). Some pox viruses, including cowpox, can infect a wide range of species, while others like smallpox and a rabbit pox virus called myxoma virus can infect only one or a few species.</p>



<p>How widely monkeypox can spread among nonrodent animal species isn’t known. Researchers have documented that the virus can infect 51 species, including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/veterinarian/monkeypox-in-animals.html#table">apes and monkeys</a>, and other animals including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7823380/">anteaters, porcupines and opossums</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, monkeypox is endemic in some parts of Africa. But some scientists worry that the global outbreak, which has <a href="https://extranet.who.int/publicemergency">infected more than 36,000 people</a> so far, creates more chances for the virus to jump from humans to animals. If that happens, the virus could become established in animal populations around the world, setting up new reservoirs that could cause repeated infections in humans and animals.</p>



<p>Preliminary research suggests that monkeypox may be able to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.13.503846v1?ct=">infect two to four times more species</a> than previously thought, researchers from the University of Liverpool in England report August 15 in a preprint on bioRxiv.org. The team used machine learning trained to consider the genetic makeup of the virus, the number of species of animals in a genus known to be infected by pox viruses, diet composition of potential hosts, where the animals live and other factors that could contribute to a species becoming a new host for monkeypox, says virologist Marcus Blagrove.</p>



<p>About 80 percent of the potential new hosts for monkeypox are rodents or primates, the researchers predict. But domestic animals like dogs and cats were also predicted to be susceptible to infection. The researchers didn’t know about the case of the dog in France when they made the prediction, Blagrove says, so the report of the canine infection “was a quite nice validation that the method works.”</p>



<p>Red foxes and brown rats are two potential monkeypox hosts that the researchers say are particularly worrisome. Foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) scavenge from garbage, which could bring them in contact with monkeypox-contaminated items. Brown rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) are already known hosts for cowpox. They are common in sewers in Europe and could get infected through feces containing monkeypox. Though the study emphasized the risk in Europe, where more than half the monkeypox cases in people in the current outbreak have been reported, the findings could be applicable more widely. Brown rats are found on <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rattus_norvegicus/">every continent except Antarctica</a>. Red <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Vulpes_vulpes/">foxes roam much of the Northern Hemisphere</a>, including North and Central America, Europe, Northern Africa and parts of Asia.</p>

<p>The study also names three European rodents that could become reservoir species. The herb field mouse (<em>Apodemus uralensis</em>), yellow-necked field mouse (<em>Apodemus flavicollis</em>) and Alpine marmot (<em>Marmota marmota</em>) all have pockets of big populations that could be ideal for passing the virus around.</p>



<p>“These are examples of wild animals that might be a reservoir. We can’t say for certain, but they might be susceptible,” Blagrove says. Those species along with foxes and brown rats should be regularly surveyed for monkeypox to prevent new reservoirs from being established, he says.</p>



<p>But just because an animal can get infected with monkeypox doesn’t mean they can pass it on. “There is a difference between accidental hosts and a reservoir,” says Giliane de Souza Trindade, a pox virologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Accidental hosts are often dead ends for the virus. A true reservoir species must be able to pass the virus from animal to animal, and then sometimes to humans they encounter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If dogs can easily get monkeypox, they may be able to pass it to humans, other dogs or other animals through feces or saliva, Trindade says. Domestic animals that live with people who get monkeypox should be isolated from sick people and from other animals outside the home, she says.</p>



<p>Trindade and her colleagues are preparing to study pets of people who have monkeypox to see whether the virus passes easily to cats and dogs, she says. But she is more worried about live animal markets. “Animals are in cages very close together and people are passing by all the time.” Such settings are ripe for transmitting viruses between species. The COVID-19 pandemic probably got its <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715">start at a live animal market</a> in Wuhan, China, researchers reported July 26 in <em>Science</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>McFadden stresses that the dog’s case is still an isolated report. “We don’t know is this a rare thing or have we just not paid attention to it?” For now, he says, efforts should be focused on containing the outbreak among humans. While people with monkeypox should take care not to pass the virus to their pets, this case shouldn’t cause undue worry, he says. “We’re not at the panic button stage just yet.”</p>



<p>Scientists are also still learning how monkeypox spreads among people. Some people may <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-2183">have monkeypox, but not develop symptoms</a>, researchers report August 16 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. It’s not known whether asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others, but if they can, vaccinating close contacts of symptomatic people may not be enough to contain the outbreak, the researchers warn.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-charm-quark-up-down-particle-physics">Protons contain intrinsic charm quarks, a new study suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons may be intrinsically charming.</p>



<p>The subatomic particles are a mash-up of three lighter particles called quarks: two of the type known as up quarks and one down quark. But physicists have speculated for decades that protons may also host more massive quarks, called “intrinsic” charm quarks. A new analysis <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04998-2">supports that idea</a>, physicists report in the Aug. 18 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Charm quarks are much heavier than up or down quarks. So heavy that, mind-bendingly, “you can have a component of the proton which is heavier than the proton itself,” says theoretical physicist Juan Rojo of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Rojo and colleagues combined a variety of experimental results and theoretical calculations in hopes of unveiling the proton’s hypothetical charm. Measuring this feature is key to fully understanding one of the most important particles in the universe, Rojo says.</p>



<p>Physicists know that the more deeply you probe a proton, the more complicated it appears. When observed at very high energies, as in collisions at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva, protons contain a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">motley crew</a> of transient quarks and their antimatter counterparts, antiquarks (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>). Such “extrinsic” quarks are created when gluons, particles that help “glue” the quarks together inside protons, split into quark-antiquark pairs.</p>



<p>Extrinsic quarks aren’t fundamental to the identity of the proton. They’re simply a result of how gluons behave at high energies. But charm quarks might exist inside protons even at low energies, in a more persistent, deep-seated form.</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles don’t take on a definite state until they’re measured — they are instead described by probabilities. If protons contain intrinsic charm, there’d be a small probability to find within a proton not only two up quarks and a down quark, but also a charm quark and antiquark. Since protons aren’t well-defined collections of individual particles, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-mass-quarks-calculation">proton’s mass</a> isn’t a simple sum of its parts (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>). The small probability means that the full mass of the charm quark and antiquark isn’t added to the proton’s heft, explaining how the proton may contain particles heavier than itself.</p>



<p>Using thousands of measurements from experiments at the LHC and other particle accelerators, combined with theoretical calculations, the team found evidence for intrinsic charm in the proton at a statistical level called 3 sigma. The intrinsic charm quarks carry about 0.6 percent of a proton’s momentum, the researchers report.</p>



<p>But 5 sigma is typically required for a conclusive result. “The data and analysis are not yet sufficient &#8230; to get from ‘evidence for’ to ‘discovery of’ intrinsic charm,” says Ramona Vogt, a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who wrote a perspective piece on the study for <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, defining what is meant by “intrinsic charm” isn’t straightforward, muddling the comparison of the new finding with earlier results from different groups. “Previous studies have found different limits on intrinsic charm partly because they have used different definitions and schemes,” says theoretical physicist Wally Melnitchouk of Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Va.</p>



<p>Notably, the new analysis incorporates results from the LHCb collaboration, which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.082001">reported measurements potentially consistent</a> with intrinsic charm in the proton in the Feb. 25 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Including that data in the analysis is “what’s really new,” says theoretical physicist C.-P. Yuan of Michigan State University in East Lansing. But Yuan has reservations about the type of calculation used to interpret the data. “It’s not done at what we today call the state-of-art analysis.”</p>



<p>Scientists need to pin down the proton’s intrinsic charm content to better understand results at the LHC and other facilities that smash protons together and observe what comes out. Researchers have to be able to gauge the ins and outs of the objects they’re colliding.</p>



<p>Data from future accelerators such as the planned Electron-Ion Collider could help, says theoretical physicist Tim Hobbs of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. For now, the proton remains mysterious. “The problem is still with us; it remains very challenging.”</p>

                <p> PLOS Note: we use this blog, on occasion, to highlight authors and their research. Today, we are shining a spotlight on this <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272730">work </a>that was published last week on PLOS ONE. The topic is dear to our heart. The author of the blog and the paper is Marc-Andre Simard. He is a Ph.D. student in information science at the University of Montr&eacute;al who works on open science and science policy.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of faster and more efficient dissemination of scholarly literature. Early in the pandemic, several publishers, such as Springer-Nature, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Elsevier, announced the opening of their COVID-19-related papers. However, it remains unclear if these papers will remain free to access for researchers and the public. For instance, Elsevier <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/coronavirus-information-center">mentioned</a> that their Novel Coronavirus Information Center will be available &ldquo;as long as necessary,&rdquo; hinting that these resources might be locked behind a paywall one day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The movement toward open access</strong></p>



<p>The scientific community has long advocated for free and unrestricted access to scholarly literature. This movement toward <em>open access</em> was formalized through 2002&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read/">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>. The idea behind the open access (OA) movement is that science is a public good that should be made available to everyone in order to remove some of the technological and financial barriers to science and accelerate research and education across the planet. Over the past 20 years, several major initiatives have been developed worldwide to support open access dissemination. These include <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO&rsquo;s Recommendation on Open Science</a> and <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/">Plan S</a>, a European initiative that aims to make research articles supported by public funds freely available online, without embargo, and with transparent pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Just how big is open access?</strong></p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search">Web of Science</a>, a database that indexes publication and citation data from about 13,000 journals annually, and <a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>, an open database tracking open access content from over 50,000 scientific publishers and repositories, we have collected a dataset of 8,137,675 documents that were published between 2015 and 2019. We found that over 40% of all scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science during that period were available in OA at the time of our data collection, with shares ranging from 21% in humanities to 50% in medical and health sciences (Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;1. Share of open access papers by discipline.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Does open access really matter for lower income countries?</strong></p>



<p>Scientific publishing is a lucrative business. Since the early 2000s, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">more than half of scientific papers have been published by the so-called &ldquo;oligopoly of publishers&rdquo;</a> that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032052-900-time-to-break-academic-publishings-stranglehold-on-research/#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20academic%20publishing,up%20and%20judge%20its%20merits.">have been making record profits</a>. Participating in science is also expensive: in order to have access to the latest scientific discoveries, it is often necessary to pay journal subscription fees that are so high that even <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/">some of the wealthiest universities in the world have decided to unsubscribe from them</a>. Low-income and developing countries are particularly vulnerable to these pricing dynamics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2021-2022">World Bank&rsquo;s country classification by income</a> and author affiliation data from the Web of Science, we have looked into the relationship between income level and 1) open access publishing and 2) references made to open access literature. Figures&nbsp;2 and 3 illustrate OA publications and references of countries compared to the world average. Our data show that low-income and lower-middle-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, tend to publish and use open access literature more than the rest of the world. However, upper-middle-income countries use open access literature less than the rest of the world, while open access practices vary greatly in high-income countries.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="924" height="542" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20581" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3.png 924w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3-300x176.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px"></figure>



<p>Figure&nbsp;3. Normalized map of the number of references made to open access per country. Green indicates that a country is over the world average, and brown indicates that a country is under the world average.</p>



<p>Those findings show that countries in sub-Saharan Africa publish and cite open access literature at a higher rate than the rest of the world. At the same time, we found that the Middle East and Asia are the areas where both their proportion of OA publications and of OA use is lower. This could be explained by the fact that most publishers provide publication fee waivers for low-income countries but not or only partially for middle-income countries. Ultimately, our study highlights national differences in open access uptake and leads us to believe that more open access initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support the broader adoption of open scholarship.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063086906">A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</a><br><em>Lindy Elkins-Tanton</em><br><em>William Morrow, $29.99</em></p>
</div>



<p>Becoming an astronomer might seem straightforward. An awe of the night sky sparks a child to someday study astronomy in school, eventually leading to a graduate degree and a job in the field. But as two new books make clear, few women find the road so simple.</p>



<p>In <em>A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</em>, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, a geologist turned planetary scientist, recounts her struggles with depression and anxiety as a child and with the sexism she faced early in her career. In one example, she and colleagues (all men but one) were collecting rock samples in Siberia, searching for evidence of a connection between volcanic eruptions and past extinction events. Taking her time to set her chisel at just the right spot to break the rock, Elkins-Tanton could “practically smell the silent impatience from the men nearby,” she writes. “Yes, they could have done it faster, and with fewer blows. But why should that be the important metric? Why is it not more important to let each person do the tasks they want and need to do, at their own pace?”</p>





<p>Her male colleagues’ implicit and explicit bias against women in science, she writes, fanned her own self-doubt. To demand the same respect as male scientists, she learned she had to insist, gently, to carry her own baggage and take her own samples, her way and on her time. The lessons she learned in Siberia and in the lab, she writes, helped her develop a compassionate and just leadership style as the director of Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and as the head of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-launch-delay-for-psyche-asteroid-mission">NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission</a>. That mission will send a spacecraft to probe a metal-rich asteroid to better understand Earth’s iron-rich core.</p>



<p>Every scientist’s experience is unique, but elements of Elkins-Tanton’s story, particularly the sexism in science, find voice throughout <em>The Sky Is for Everyone: Women Astronomers in Their Own Words</em>. Edited by astronomer Virginia Trimble and author David Weintraub, this anthology of 37 short autobiographies covers more than six decades of astronomy and shows the varied paths of female astronomers and the roadblocks that can slow or sideline their success.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691207100">The Sky Is for Everyone</a><br><em>Virginia Trimble and David A. Weintraub (eds.)</em><br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</p>

<p>Astrophysicist France Córdova, for instance, opens her story with an evocative description of the time she spent in the summer of 1968 in a pueblo near Oaxaca City, Mexico, working on a cultural anthropology project. She had planned to study anthropology in graduate school, but after watching a TV show on dead stars, she realized she “had a deeper wanderlust inside,” she writes, “to connect with something wider, deeper than I could imagine — the stars and the Universe that held them.”</p>



<p>As a child, Córdova hadn’t known anyone who believed women could be scientists. Her parents thought finding a husband should be her college goal. Instead, she chose to pursue a graduate degree in astrophysics. She launched a career in X-ray astronomy and then pivoted again to policy and leadership, assuming the role of NASA’s chief scientist and later head of the National Science Foundation — positions where, she writes, she could advocate more effectively for women in science.</p>



<p>Dara Norman, in contrast, never questioned that she’d become an astronomer; by age 10 she was certain. She earned a Ph.D. in 1999 after studying bias in the measurements of distant galaxies that can distort our understanding of the universe. To her, the similarities between biases in scientific data and biases in the culture of science were blatant. “I am amazed that as scientists we understand the idea of bias in our data and methods…. We work tirelessly to identify such biases … and eliminate that bias,” she writes. “However, when confronted with bias in our profession … many of us continue to deny the existence of the issue.”</p>





<p>Norman realized the traditional path of an astronomer wasn’t for her. The joy of doing research was overshadowed by the negative experiences she endured “as a Black American woman just trying to <em>be</em> a scientist.” Like Córdova, she now works to improve the culture of science, at the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Lab in Tucson.</p>



<p>That culture is changing, slowly. Before 1990, fewer than 40 women held full-time positions in astronomy or astrophysics at North American universities. Now, the number is high enough that it’s not as easy to track how many women successfully pursue a career in the field, Trimble and Weintraub note. Although those numbers point to progress, both books remind readers that blatant and subtle acts of sexism are still present and that careers in science can still be precarious for women. And yet women persist, perhaps, as Elkins-Tanton writes, driven by the “realization that we are only a tiny part of a vast unexplored universe.” If true, it’s a pillar of resilience to aspire to.</p>

                <p>In a new study from <em>PLOS Climate</em> authors Laura Niggli at University of Zurich, Switzerland and colleagues have found that the cascading effects of extreme weather &ndash; such as recent heat waves which combine heat and drought &ndash; and the interconnectedness of critical services and sectors has the potential to destabilize socioeconomic systems. Learn on to learn more about the researchers&rsquo; findings below or visit <em>PLOS Climate</em> to access the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Over the past several decades, the frequency and magnitude of concurrent climate extremes, such as heat and drought events, have increased. These events can affect many different assets, sectors and systems of the human environment, including human security, health, and well-being, although many risk assessments and resilience plans only consider individual events.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>To better understand how extreme weather might affect interlinked socioeconomic systems, the authors of the present study conducted a qualitative network-type analysis, first reviewing studies of eight historical concurrent heat and drought extreme events in Europe, Africa and Australia. Next, they compiled examples of interlinked impacts on several critical services and sectors, including human health, transport, agriculture and food production, and energy. For example, drought events reduced river navigation options, limiting the transport of critical goods. Rail transport was simultaneously stymied when prolonged heat buckled the tracks. Using these analyses, researchers created visualizations of the interconnected effects of concurrent heat and drought events on those services and sectors.</p>

<p>The researchers found the most important cascading processes and interlinkages centered around the health, energy and agriculture and food production sectors. In some instances, response measures for one sector had negative effects on other sectors. Future research should focus on response measures in interconnected systems to improve the resilience to compound heat and drought events.</p>



<p>According to the authors, &ldquo;We identified an interconnected web of sectors that interact and cause additional losses and damages in several other sectors. This multilevel interconnectedness makes the risks of compound extreme events so complex and critical. More efforts should be concentrated on the analysis of such cascading risks and on strategies to interrupt such chains of impacts, rather than compartmentalizing risk assessment into single extreme events, impacts and sectors&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Author Laura Niggli adds: &ldquo;This study presents unprecedented quantitative information and qualitative understanding on the impacts of combined heat and drought events in major world regions over the past 20 years. It contributes new insights into how these impacts cascade through critical systems (health, energy, food production, etc.) and emphasizes the importance to appropriately consider such impact cascades in adaptation efforts.&rdquo;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/pexels-pixabay-220213-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>A participatory method</strong></p>
<p>Ripple Effects Mapping, or REM, is a participatory and qualitative form of impact evaluation. When we learned of this method, we thought that it would be invaluable in helping understand some of the complex public health interventions we were evaluating – particularly the elements that were deemed hard-to-measure. However, to make it more suited to our needs, we adapted it further. It is this adapted method that we talk more about here.</p>
<p>One fundamental aspect of REM is that it is participatory. This means that the people who are involved in the design or delivery of an intervention, and those who are affected by it, are invited to participate in data collection workshops. These workshops are qualitative in nature, and so we aim to build up a collective picture of what happened during the life-course of an intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Running a REM workshop</strong></p>
<p>Workshops are usually split into five main sections. The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>first </em></span><em>section</em> gives everyone time to speak with each other; to discuss how they have been involved in the intervention, what they are proud of, and what impacts have been important to them. This is predominantly a warm-up activity.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>second and third</em></span> <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>sections</em></span> are perhaps the most important. Small groups of 4-6 people are formed, and groups are asked to start writing down and discussing what they were involved in and what the impacts have been. They capture this on flip chart paper which has a timeline in its centre (e.g. Figure 1). A facilitator can guide participants through the activity by asking probing questions. They also make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute to the activities.</p>
<p>One of the adaptations we made was that REM is viewed as both a retrospective and prospective method. In the workshops, participants can map their activities and impacts over the previous 3-6 months, and they can also anticipate what they envisage will happen over the next 3-6 months. Follow up workshops can then be carried out 3-6 months later where they revisit the previous REM outputs and ask, &#8220;Did what we think was going to happen, happen?&#8221; We also recommend that the first REM workshop is delivered in the first 3-6 months of their work.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>fourth section</em></span> is a reflective one. Now that activities and impacts are visualised, the facilitator can ask participants to reflect on what they deem to be the most significant and why. But often, a more interesting conversation happens around the least significant impacts. Where did they invest time and energy which didn’t lead to anything meaningful? Why did this happen? What could be done in the future to minimise this happening again? Were other factors at play which prevented their work being impactful? Some of this can also be added to the map, or it could be audio-recorded and analysed later.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>last section</em></span> of the workshop is also reflective. REM is not only an evaluative tool but also one which can drive continuous intervention improvement. So here, the facilitator can get the group to discuss what they will do next because of attending the REM workshop. It might be that some participants didn’t previously know of each other, and merely being in the workshop created the opportunity for new collaborations.</p>
<p>Workshops usually require a couple of hours. If you have less time, then elements of the workshop can be shortened. The follow up workshops can be shorter too as participants become more familiar with the method. We’ve tested the adapted method in online and in-person formats. Both can work, and each has pros and cons, but the in-person format probably allows for greater levels of participation and discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01570-4">paper</a> and our <a href="https://arc-w.nihr.ac.uk/training-and-capacity-building/arc-west-courses/introduction-to-ripple-effects-mapping/">supplementary online training</a>, we provide further details on how to apply the method, the circumstances in which it may be useful, and perhaps most importantly, we encourage others to adapt the method to meet their own needs. Hopefully, this method, and future iterations of it, offer one means of capturing the realities of efforts to improve public health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/football-spiral-wobble-frequency-physics">Spiraling footballs wobble at one of two specific frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>In American football, some passes are caught and some are dropped — but all wobble as they fly.</p>



<p>Spiraling pigskins tend to <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/openengineering/article/doi/10.1115/1.4054692/1141841/Modeling-the-Dynamics-of-an-American-Football-and">visibly wobble at either a slow or fast frequency</a>, depending on how the ball is thrown, researchers report online June 23 in the <em>ASME Open Journal of Engineering</em>. That wobble, and to a lesser extent Earth’s rotation and the ball’s spin, cause passes to stray sideways — so don’t completely blame the quarterback this upcoming season.</p>





<p>“The fact that [a football] wobbles and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t go straight — those are the two big effects that you see in a pass,” says mechanical engineer John Dzielski of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.</p>



<p>Using physics equations from ballistics studies and data from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02859892">wind tunnel experiments with footballs</a>, Dzielski and software engineer Mark Blackburn, also of the Stevens Institute, ran computer simulations of a spiraling football pass.</p>



<p>They found that a pigskin flying at around 27 meters per second with around 600 rotations per minute would visibly wobble either one or five times per second. Wobbling occurs as the ball’s spinning momentum interacts with a twisting force that acts to turn the football’s nose away from the direction of flight. The faster wobble dominates when extra energy is applied during throws by twisting of the wrist or lateral motion of the arm.</p>



<p>That wobbling generates lift that pushes the ball sideways, potentially changing the landing point by several meters, the team reports. Earth’s rotation also could cause a pass to drift several centimeters. And the Magnus effect — whereby a spinning projectile becomes sandwiched by low- and high-pressure zones of air, bending its trajectory — had double that impact.</p>



<p>Dzielski and Blackburn are now interested in refining their simulations by developing an instrument to gather data from footballs in flight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impacts-created-mars-planetary-sand">Asteroid impacts might have created some of Mars’ sand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sand on Earth is continuously being created by the slow erosion of rocks. But on Mars, violent asteroid impacts may play an important role in making new sand.</p>



<p>As much as a quarter of Martian sand is composed of spherical bits of glass forged in the intense heat of impacts, a new study shows. Since windblown sand sculpts the Martian landscape, this discovery reveals how <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2022/pdf/6526.pdf">asteroid impacts contribute to shaping Mars</a>, even long after the collisions occur, Purdue University planetary scientist Briony Horgan and colleagues suggest. The team will present their results August 18 at the 85th Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>





<p>Using data collected by spacecraft orbiting Mars, Horgan and collaborators looked at different wavelengths of visible and infrared light reflected from the planet’s surface to determine the minerals present in Martian sand. The team found signatures of glass all over the planet, particularly at higher latitudes.</p>



<p>One explanation for all that glass is volcanic eruptions, which are known to produce glass when magma mixes with water. But the most glass-rich swath of Mars — the planet’s northern plains — is conspicuously bereft of volcanoes, the researchers note. That rules out volcanic eruptions as the culprit in that location and instead suggests that far more cataclysmic events — asteroid impacts — might be involved.</p>



<p>That’s a plausible argument, says Steven Goderis, a geochemist at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium who was not involved in the research. “Often Mars is seen as a volcanic planet. But there’s also a very strong impact component, and this is often overlooked.”</p>



<p>When an asteroid moving at several kilometers per second slams into a rocky planet like Mars, the energy of the event melts nearby rocks and launches them skywards. That molten shrapnel fragments and produces sand grain–sized pieces that are roughly spherical. Those bits of glass — called impact spherules — eventually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteor-explosion-over-antarctica-impact-rock">rain back onto the planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).</p>

<p>Over the last 3 billion years, asteroid impacts could have plausibly blanketed the surface of Mars in a layer of impact spherules roughly half a meter thick, Horgan and her colleagues calculate. All that material added to the sand on Mars that formed through normal erosion. “Impacts helped supply sand to the surface continuously over time,” Horgan says.</p>



<p>Scientists might have the opportunity to analyze Martian impact spherules in the future. NASA’s Perseverance rover is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">currently storing samples of Martian sand and rocks</a> for eventual return to Earth (<em>SN: 9/10/21</em>). That’s exciting, Horgan says. “The record of all this is in the sand.”</p>
