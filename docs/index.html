                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/eCMuFBXT4t4/">Celebrate Open Data Day with Us!</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/03/screenshot-3-1-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p>Around the world tomorrow groups from all sectors will be celebrating <a href="https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> – an annual event that highlights the benefits of open data and encourages the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society. As publishers, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">data availability</a> is crucial for the validation and foundation of new research and key to our mission to help researchers advance the scientific record. In the spirit of Open Data Day, we’ve decided to defer to researchers and data enthusiasts to answer the questions: why is data important and how can we make it better?</p>
<p>We got our answers from <a href="https://prabakaran-group.org/index.html">Sudhakaran Prabakaran</a>, one of a number of dedicated volunteers at Cambridge University known as the <a href="https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions">Data Champions</a> who are helping advise members of the research community on managing their data. Read his thoughts below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Who are the Data Champions? What kinds of data questions do you help researchers navigate?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think it’s a fantastic forum. [We have] a lot of discussions and people exchange ideas and not necessarily just in the sciences but also in every other field. [Data management] can be kind of confusing, even simple things like can I put my [datasets] in Dropbox? Can I share them in Google Drive? You’re talking about even labeling stuff in desktop computers. There is no clarity because this landscape is fast-moving and people are not trained to catch up with that kind of speed at which things change.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What are you working on right now? How does open data play a role in it?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our lab thrives on open data. We train machine learning algorithms that looks at specific regions of the human genome and trying to identify the most important mutations and then identify drugs to target them. Most of the datasets I work with people have already published and analyzed those datasets and they’ve extracted what they want. I’m kind of looking at things that they don’t want – I’m looking at non-coding regions, just kind of digging deeper into the datasets.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Why do you think open data is important? What do you think the future open data landscape looks like?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I don’t think open data is enough…it’s the analysis also. For example, we train a lot of machine learning algorithms and in the process we fail many, many times and we know the pitfalls we know what to avoid. But if you share that process with other people that will enable them to overcome it, to get there. It is very difficult and that process can be shared with people.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think future young people are going to be brought up in an environment where they can just click something and get access to the code and get access to the data themselves. And then the issues of reproducibility would be mitigated if you can share what you’ve done and the data set is there for other people to work with.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What advice would you give to authors and researchers to encourage them to share their data?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think we have encountered these scenarios even as a data champion in my own department. I think if you if you have incentives, as in [getting] your DOI and authorships for the dataset even before publication then it’s easy to share. It’s your data, [someone] can probably do a different kind of analysis and publish it but they have to cite this data and you will be benefited by that.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And it’s in the best interest of the authors to share it ahead of time because of reproducibility.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What can you do to encourage good data management?</strong></p>
<p>You can practice the open data lifestyle by sharing your research data in an open repository and making it available when you submit your manuscript. If you’re reviewing a submission, knowing how to evaluate the associated datasets can be tricky which is why we’ve worked with the Data Champions to cover everything you need to know in this <a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Peer+Reviewing+Datasets.pdf"><strong>Reviewer’s Quick Guide to Assessing Datasets</strong></a>. If the manuscript you’re reviewing doesn’t have an associated dataset, request it!</p>
<p><strong>About the Data Champions Program</strong></p>
<p>The Data Champions Programme is a network of volunteers who advise members of the research community on proper handling of research data. In this, they promote good research data management (RDM) and support Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (<a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/newsitem/?id=4615">FAIR</a>) research principles. It is run by the Research Data Management Facility at the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryohei Yasuda of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has received a grant by the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH. The award is for $2.9 million over 5 years and will continue the funding of Yasuda’s work with Rab proteins.</p>
<p>Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, Dr. Yasuda is studying Rab proteins’ impact on learning and memory by tracking how molecules become activated and interact with each other. By better understanding how these proteins communicate with each other, scientists may one day be able to develop interventions for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and other brain disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda is a Scientific Director of MPFI and leads the Neuronal Signal Transduction Lab. He has received many recognitions for his outstanding research in neuroscience, including the 2015 National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Pioneer Award, which recognizes scientists demonstrating creativity and groundbreaking approaches in biomedical or behavioral science. Dr. Yasuda was one of only 13 scientists in the country to receive the NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.</p>
<p>Additional awards include the Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the New Investigator Award from the Alzheimer’s Association, and Research Award for Innovative Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda received his PhD in Physics in 1998 from Keio University Graduate School of Science and Technology in Yokohama, Japan. In his PhD studies, he demonstrated that the enzyme ATP synthase is a rotary motor made of single molecule and that its energy conversion efficiency is close to 100%. From 2000 to 2005, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he built an imaging device to monitor protein interactions in living cells with high sensitivity and resolution. From 2005 to 2012, he was an assistant professor of the Neurobiology department at the Duke University Medical Center where he developed a number of techniques to visualize signaling activity in single synapses. From 2009 to 2012, Dr. Yasuda served as an Early Career Scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute before coming to MPFI in 2012.</p>

<p>Major disasters clearly take a toll on the survivors who had the misfortune to go through them. But there is another group of people who can suffer mental and physical distress from disasters: those who experience them second-hand, through media coverage and conversation. After 9/11, for example, researchers found an increase in symptoms of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002214650504600304">depression</a> and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-10485-003">stress</a> among Americans who hadn’t directly experienced the terrorist attacks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But there have always been doubts about studies purporting to show evidence of vicarious distress. Because disasters occur randomly researchers are usually unable to gather data until weeks after the event, and they often have no record of people’s baseline mood before the disaster.</p>
<p>By chance a new study was able to overcome these limitations. When tragedy struck the Netherlands in 2014, there was a ready-made group of participants who were already recording their daily experiences. In May of that year, Bertus Jeronimus and colleagues at the University of Groningen had begun a crowd-sourced diary study called “HowNutsAreTheDutch” to examine mental health in the Netherlands. Three times per day for 30 days, participants completed questionnaires on their phones that measured their mood and recent activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two months into the project, on 17 July 2014, Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 298 on board. One hundred and ninety-six of the victims were Dutch and the disaster received widespread attention in the Dutch media.</p>
<p>For their study published recently in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i>, Jeronimus and colleagues took advantage of this tragic twist of fate and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12358">examined the data</a> gathered from 141 participants who were taking part around the time of the MH17 crash, to see how they were affected by their vicarious experience of the disaster.</p>
<p><span id="more-36590"></span></p>
<p>The team compared participants’ ratings of their mood and physical discomfort in the three days immediately following the crash with their average ratings earlier and later in the study. In each questionnaire, participants had rated themselves for six positive moods (e.g. energetic, cheerful) and six negative moods (e.g. irritable, tired). The questionnaires also measured the extent of general physical discomfort – for example, experience of symptoms like headaches or diarrhoea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As expected, in the three days after the crash the participants showed a higher level of negative emotion and a lower level of positive emotion, and also reported more physical discomfort. But although statistically significant these responses were pretty small: each rating scale ranged from 0 to 100, and the biggest effect (for physical discomfort) represented a change of just 2.78 points on this scale.</p>
<p>The researchers then looked at whether these changes were associated with aspects of participants’ personality like neuroticism and extraversion. These results were surprising: they had expected that people high in neuroticism, who worry and ruminate a lot, might be more affected by the crash – but in fact these participants tended to show <i>less</i> of a reduction in positive mood than people low in neuroticism. On the other hand, strong extraverts, who usually score higher on happiness and mood than introverts, tended to have a greater drop in mood than the quieter types.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors speculated that extraverts tend to socialise more and so could have spent more time talking about the disaster with others, precipitating a drop in their mood. High scorers on neuroticism, they suggested, might be more likely to respond to stress that directly involves themselves, rather than vicarious experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Personality had no association with changes to negative mood, and overall the authors concluded that “broad personality domains are of little importance in predicting differences in vicarious exposure effects.” In this respect, age seemed more important: older participants tended to have less of an increase in negative emotions. Older people may have better strategies for coping with traumatic events, the author say.</p>
<p>Although the study was exploratory, it provides a rare insight into how indirect experience of disasters can affect the general population, albeit in small ways. But while the MH17 crash was a shocking event, it also occurred halfway across Europe and didn’t involve a continuing threat to the population of the Netherlands, which, the authors say, “may have allowed them to retain their sense of safety”. The effects of vicariously experiencing a more immediate disaster – and the importance of personality differences in this response – could be quite different.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Multimorbidity is the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions in a patient. Technological and social changes are resulting in increases in both sedentary lifestyles and life expectancy, which in turn lead to more people developing multimorbidity. This trends has begun putting significant pressures on the medical sector and its infrastructure. Nurses, in particular, are faced with significant challenges whilst coordinating multiple care plans for their patients’ individual conditions.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10851" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10851 size-medium" height="176" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/nurs-twitter-300x176.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Most frequently used words during the #FutNur Twitter chat, from O’Connor et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The Florence Nightingale Fodunation took to Twitter to ask nurses four questions related to multimorbidity and encouraged Twitter users to suggest solutions and to debate amongst each other. Twenty-four users responded using the hashtag created by the foundation, #FutNur, potentially reaching over 50,000 Twitter users. In a recent paper, O’Connor <em>et al.</em> used these data to research what nurses believe is needed to care for patients with multimorbidity.</p>
<p>The replies were grouped into five particular themes of what the nursing profession must focus on in order to effectively cope with morbidity. Helping patients and their friends and family deal with the burden of having multiple chronic conditions was the initial focus. Next was the type of care nurses need to deliver, with the respondents believing holistic care is essential. Additional themes were the need for more evidence on methods of treating multimorbidity and the quality of education nurses receive regarding this issue. Finally, the respondents expressed a frustration in the way the health services were designed, and several suggestions were made to improve it.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that Twitter, and other social media, can potentially be very helpful in research amongst health professionals. Furthermore, they found that there are many ways in which coping with multimorbidity can be made easier. These include investing in research and nursing education surrounding the topic and creating better tools and guidelines to help nurses care for those with multimorbidity.</p>
<h3><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-018-0277-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">From apprehension to advocacy:  nursing students’ experiences with care home placement</a></h3>
<p>As populations around the world age, more nurses with experience caring for older adults are needed. However, lack of interest among nursing students and insufficient education in nursing schools focused on care of older adults have contributed to a nursing workforce, already stretched thin across all fields, that is not prepared to care for this growing demographic. One potential solution is placement of nursing students within residential aged care (RAC) settings for clinical education.</p>
<p>In order to explore key stakeholders’ experiences with nursing student placement in RAC, Moquin <em>et al.</em> conducted a qualitative study using a participatory action research approach. Nursing students were interviewed both before and after placement, and their instructors, RAC staff, and residents were interviewed after.</p>
<p>The study found that although students began their placements with a range of concerns, over the course of the placement, they became comfortable in the setting and actively engaged with and advocated for the residents.  Although many of the students indicated that they were unlikely to pursue a career in RAC, they did value the skills learned and felt that they would be better prepared to care for older patients in other settings.</p>
<h3><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-018-0309-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nurses’ experiences of an unfamiliar method of assisted suicide</a></h3>
<p>Assisted suicide in Switzerland is legal and not uncommon. Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking (VSED) is a method of actively hastening one’s own death, and doesn’t require a doctor’s approval or a terminal diagnosis, though it does often require medical support from nurses or medical staff. It is the individual’s choice, and it allows them, and their friends and families, time to prepare for their death. But how do nurses feel about VSED in their professional role?</p>
<p>Saladin <em>et al.</em> conducted an embedded single case study of a patient living in a long-term care institution choosing to end her life via VSED. By conducting group and individual interviews, they gathered information regarding the impact of this choice on those closest to the patient, including relatives and care institution staff.</p>
<p>The results of the interviews showed that the nursing staff felt obliged to help the patient hasten her death via VSED, as it was her choice to do so. They further described how the general manager of the institution initially did not want to allow VSED to occur, but the nursing staff advocated for the patient. In doing so, the staff sometimes struggled between caring for the person and arguing with the institution they worked for. They had to find an acceptable way both for the patient to be allowed to choose her death and for the institution to be comfortable with the process.</p>

<p>The study concludes that the attitude of the institution itself can be decisive in how VSED is dealt with; VSED can be perceived as suicide or as natural dying, and institutions are generally less comfortable with the former. Therefore, the authors believe it is important that health care professionals develop a professional opinion of VSED, thereby benefiting patients who choose VSED towards the end of their lives, as well as their relatives and those who care for them.</p>

<p>Many of the healthcare interventions launched as part of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> rely on a sufficient workforce of nurses with relevant competencies, but Sub-Saharan Africa has an estimated shortfall of 600,000 nurses needed for these initiatives. Improvements in nursing education are needed to increase the nursing workforce and improve the quality of healthcare. This review from Bvumbwe and Mtshali integrated literature reporting on nursing education challenges and their solutions, in order to identify needs for and possible methods of improvement.</p>
<p>Systematic and targeted searches of academic and gray literature led to a final sample of 20 academic and five gray-literature articles. Thematic analysis was used to identify six themes, representing different challenges and their possible solutions: curriculum reforms, professional regulation, transformative teaching strategies, collaboration and partnership, capacity building, and infrastructure and resources. Within each of these areas, gaps and unmet demands were identified along with reforms and interventions that were beginning to address them in some contexts.</p>
<p>This review highlighted common challenges in nursing education faced by many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, from lack of infrastructure to insufficient faculty. Strategies to address these challenges are being implemented and this review points to those that have had positive effects and to where further efforts are needed.</p>

<p>In contact sports like boxing and rugby you can use your pre-match nerves to fuel your determination, speed and aggression. In contrast, in a sport like table tennis that involves fine motor control, nerves can also stifle your performance, making you stiff and clumsy. It seems obvious that learning to control your emotions prior to games should therefore be important to table tennis players (and competitors in other sports that require precision). Yet, surprisingly, as the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12451?af=R">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality</em> point out, “to date, only a few studies have investigated the relation between emotional regulation and … sport performance”.</p>
<p>To find out more, Jeanette Kubiak and her colleagues, at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, surveyed hundreds of league table tennis players in Germany about the ways they controlled their emotions prior to matches, and then compared these results against objective measures of the participants’ league performance. The research uncovered several emotional control strategies used more often by better and improving players. “Taken together, the findings provide evidence for the importance of emotion regulation regarding sport performance,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-36560"></span></p>
<p>Over 300 table tennis players took part covering a wide range of ability and with an average of 24 years experience playing the game (the average age was 39 and there were 70 women). Reflecting on the prior season, players rated how often they tended to use ten different emotional control strategies based on the “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2014.940781">process model of emotion regulation</a>” put forward by Stanford clinical psychologist James Gross.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at two end-of-season objective measures of success. The first was the players’ end-of-season ranking. They found that higher-ranked players more often calmed their pre-match nerves by: using physical preparation (e.g. swinging their arms and getting warmed up); using positive self-talk (e.g. telling themselves they will win); planning (e.g. thinking about their tactics); and by suppressing their negative emotions and deliberately giving off an impression of supreme confidence. At the same time, higher-ranked players <em>less</em> often reported catastrophising, such as thinking how badly the game could go.</p>
<p>The second outcome measure was improved performance over the previous season – that is, winning more games this season than last. Improving players more often used positive self-talk and less often indulged in self-blame (e.g. thinking they should have practiced more); ruminated less about their anxious feelings; and catastrophised less.</p>
<p>The study is limited by its cross-sectional design. For instance, it’s possible that winning and earning a higher ranking changed how players managed their emotions, rather than emotional regulation driving better performance. The retrospective nature of the survey is another short-coming – it’s even possible that winning changes how players think about and remember their emotional strategies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Kubiak and her team point out, “no [previous] studies have investigated several emotion regulation strategies affiliated with different stages in the process model of emotion regulation in handling emotions prior to a competition”.  They added that their findings “are interesting for sports psychology because they help to clarify why some competitive athletes fail to take full advantage of their performance potential, whereas others are successful.”</p>

<p>A fundamental feature of learning in animals is the “ability to forget” that allows an organism to perceive, model, and make decisions from disparate streams of information and adapt to changing environments. Against this backdrop, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) for improved recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) for real time online learning in a dynamic environment. We incorporate an adaptive weight decay mechanism with the traditional spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning to model adaptivity in SNNs. The leak rate of the synaptic weights is modulated based on the temporal correlation between the spiking patterns of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This mechanism helps in gradual forgetting of insignificant data while retaining significant, yet old, information. ASP, thus, maintains a balance between forgetting and immediate learning to construct a stable-plastic self-adaptive SNN for continuously changing inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed learning methodology addresses catastrophic forgetting, while yielding significantly improved accuracy over the conventional STDP learning method for digit recognition applications. In addition, we observe that the proposed learning model automatically encodes selective attention toward relevant features in the input data, while eliminating the influence of background noise (or denoising) further improving the robustness of the ASP learning.</p>

<p>For decades, linguists have debated the extent to which language influences the way we think. While the more extreme theories that language <i>determines</i> what we can and can’t think about have fallen out of favour, there is still considerable evidence that the languages we speak shape the way we see the world in more subtle ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For instance, people are better at perceiving the difference between light and dark blue <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/">if they have dedicated words for those colours</a> (like in Russian) than if they don’t (like in English). But it turns out it’s not just the words that we use: the way in which a language is structured – its syntax – is also important. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37654-9">In a recent study</a> in <i>Scientific Reports</i>, Federica Amici and colleagues show that the word order of a language predicts how good its speakers are at remembering the first or last parts of a list.</p>
<p><span id="more-36556"></span></p>
<p>The team conducted memory tasks with speakers of eight different languages around the world. Four of the languages were what’s known as right-branching – Ndonga, Khmer, Thai and Italian – and four were left-branching – Japanese, Korean, Khoekhoe and Sidaama. They included 24-30 speakers of each language, and tested them in their local area, with the help of a translator where necessary.</p>
<p>In a right-branching language, the most important part of a phrase, known as the “head”, comes first, followed by words that give more information about that word. So in the phrase “The tiger who came to tea”, the head ‘tiger’ is at the beginning of the sentence, followed by words that reveal more about him (i.e. that he came to tea).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A left-branching language is the opposite: the extra information comes first, and the head is at the end of the sentence. The same phrase in a left-branching language would be something like “who came to tea, the tiger”. (English is mainly right-branching, but has some left-branching tendencies: we put adjectives <i>before</i> the noun that they modify, as in “the hungry tiger”, rather than “the tiger hungry”).</p>
<p>In right-branching languages, the meaning of a sentence is clear from the start because the head is encountered immediately. But in left-branching languages, speakers need to keep a lot of information in mind before they get to the important part of the sentence that clarifies what it’s all about. So the researchers wondered whether speakers of left-branching languages would be generally better at remembering the early parts of lists of stimuli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants completed three tests designed to tap into working memory, which involves holding information in mind while also processing other information – a key skill in language. For each test, they viewed a sequence of pictures (or some other visual sequence) while simultaneously completing a second distracting task like performing mental arithmetic or judging whether an image was symmetrical. At the end of each series they had to recall the sequence they’d seen in the correct order. These sequences varied across tests and included pictures of animals and objects, different numbers of blue circles, and red squares in a series of grids.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team then compared how well the speakers of the two kinds of language remembered stimuli from the first and second halves of the sequences. As they predicted, left-branching speakers were better at recalling the first half of lists than right-branching speakers, and worse at recalling the second half.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results show how the languages we speak can have fairly broad influences on cognition, say the authors. “Specific characteristics of a language appear to predict not only the way we perceive and conceptualize the world,” they write, “but also the way we process, store and retrieve information.”</p>
<p>The research also demonstrates how differences in culture and language can bias findings in psychology. For example, based almost entirely on Western participants, memory researchers have found that people tend to recall the first and last parts of lists better than the middle parts – phenomena referred to as the “primacy” and “recency” effects –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>which have long been considered a fundamental aspect of how memory works. It is clear from this new study that the language participants speak could have a significant impact on these kinds of results, potentially challenging whether human memory always works that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But for now, the study remains preliminary. The overall differences in memory between left- and right-branching languages appear fairly small, and the eight languages the authors studied are just a tiny fraction of the more than 7,000 spoken around the world. Whether the results will be replicated in a larger sample remains to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Say you’re planning to run a marathon, and you have a target time in mind. Or you’re on a weight- loss diet, and your aim is to lose six kilos in six weeks. Or, there’s an exam coming up, and you want to score above 75 per cent. These are all individual goal pursuits. In theory, you’re not in direct competition with anybody else, though of course if you’re part of a running club, or a weight loss group, or an undergraduate class, you will be aware that others around you are striving to achieve their own goals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s plenty of evidence that sharing your own goals and hearing about other people’s can be helpful – in providing mutual encouragement, emotional support and motivation. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspi0000170">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> shows how, in certain circumstances, we can’t help ourselves from competing with others – an effect that can be surprisingly counterproductive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The findings suggest that when we’re paired with an individual striving for a similar goal and who is similarly able, we begin to view this other person as an opponent – leading us to sabotage their efforts, ultimately to the detriment of our own performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Pursuing individual goals together with others can at times lead to counter-productive behaviours that not only harm others but also harm oneself,” report Szu-chi Huang at Stanford University, and her colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36545"></span></p>
<p>The researchers ran six experiments. In the first, 200 participants performed rounds of a “word creativity” task, in which they had to make make as many words as possible from a string of letters. They were told they were paired with a “partner” (in fact, a fictional person) who had done slightly better on each round. The participants were given their own personal goal: if they created enough words, they’d be rewarded with a gift card. Another detail is that participants were also able to make the tasks harder or easier for their partner – an opportunity they exploited. Even though their partner’s performance was technically irrelevant to their own goal pursuit, as participants got close to achieving their goal, they tended to choose to make the task harder for their partner – “sabotaging” their partner’s chances. What’s more, after doing this, the participants eased up on their own efforts – they “coasted”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Subsequent experiments, some involving other tasks (such as a card game), revealed that the pattern of getting close to a personal goal, sabotaging one’s partner, then coasting, happened whether the participants were led to believe they were slightly ahead of or slightly behind their partner. However, a further study revealed that only participants who believed their sabotaging efforts were successful eased up on their own efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers write: “This study thus provided further support that the main purpose of sabotage was to ‘take the opponent down’ a notch; when this positional gain was plausibly realised, people relaxed their effort, even though their sabotaging act did nothing to advance their own individual goal.”</p>
<p>Huang and her colleagues said their findings suggest that when we perform alongside other people who share similar goals to us, we can’t help ourselves from becoming competitive, which shifts our focus from bettering ourselves to defeating our “opponent”, and then relaxing our own efforts. “This is unexpectedly counterproductive to the attainment of people’s own individual goals,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The work contributes to a growing field of research on the social side of goal pursuit. It seems that although we can help each other in the early stages of own parallel journeys, these relationships can become harmful when our goal comes into sight. Being aware of this may help you to understand when to stop paying attention to other people’s progress, and to focus on keeping your own efforts up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The Journal of Health Psychology has just published an extraordinary pair of papers that call for a new inquiry into a 30-year old case of probable scientific fraud.

According to Anthony J. Pelosi, author of the main paper, the case was "one of the worst scientific scandals of all time" and yet has never been formally investigated. The journal's editor, David F. Marks, agrees and, in an editorial, also calls for the retraction or correction of up to 61 papers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the number of referrals to the UK’s only gender identity development service (GIDS, at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust) increasing sharply in recent years – a pattern seemingly mirrored in other European countries and the US (anecdotally, at least — many countries don’t keep comprehensive data the way the UK does) – debate has inevitably intensified over how best to help transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth. As some expert clinicians </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/images/sgd-sgd0000167_tcm7-211986.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there has been a tendency for commentators, campaigners and the general public to adopt an oversimplified view in which therapists are seen as fitting one of two categories: those who don’t believe their clients when they say they are trans (and who are therefore condemned by trans advocacy groups for practicing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversion therapy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and others who simply accept their clients’ statements about their gender, and who are therefore </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirmative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clinical reality is more complicated: these days, there is a welcome consensus against actual <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/psychologists-back-call-end-conversion-therapy">conversion therapy</a> — forcing a young person to “go back” to being cisgender — but at the same time responsible clinicians do not simply nod along to what a young person with gender dysphoria says. There are complexities inherent to childhood and adolescent development, and many experts warn it’s important not to accidentally medicalise perfectly normal qualms about growing up, hitting puberty, and being exposed to powerful and often frustratingly restrictive gender roles. Young people present at gender clinics with a wide variety of issues ranging from </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/17/most-children-and-teens-with-gender-dysphoria-also-have-multiple-other-psychological-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comorbid mental-health issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to unexamined trauma, and the process of helping them determine the best path forward, particularly with regard to medical interventions like </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/23/systematic-review-puberty-suppressing-drugs-do-not-alleviate-gender-dysphoria/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a lot more complicated than making a rapid decision to deny or approve such interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, in </span><a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/103/7/631.full?ijkey=HsMwyZDRtsKu83z&amp;keytype=ref"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open-access practice review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMJ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, clinicians at UCL, GIDS and Great Ormond Street Hospital explained that the thorough psychosexual assessment period for such clients “usually takes 6 months or more over a minimum of four to six sessions” and involves a range of psychometric measures and interviews, covering the client’s expectations and understanding of social and physical transition, their mood and emotional functioning. The review adds that, “With the adolescents, there is an in-depth consideration of their sexuality and fertility, and possible preservation approaches are discussed. The attitude of important people in the child’s life towards gender dysphoria needs to be explored and understood.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290">a study published in </a></span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology &amp; Sexuality </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by a pair of Norwegian researchers, Reidar Schel Jessen and Katrina Roen, has explored these complexities from clinical psychologists’ perspective, including what it means to help a young person work through the issues they are facing and to make important decisions about medical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-36483"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the study, “Five clinical psychologists working with gender non-conforming youth in an interdisciplinary team at a specialized gender identity clinic in Europe participated in interviews.” In reading their work, I was struck repeatedly by how similar their experiences were to what I heard when I spoke with American clinicians for </span><a href="https://theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an in-depth article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about transgender youth for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Jessen and Roen write that “Sometimes the clients themselves want to transition, but sometimes the possibility seems driven by the family or others in the young person’s life, such as school staff.” The pair include a poignant example of this:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One young person I worked with […] was referred by school. Biological male, who presented in very… like stereotypically… call it female clothes, like pink and yellow, long hair. Often was read as female, and the school didn’t know what to do with the young person. But when I met the young person, the young person didn’t have any issues with the body or […] developing in a masculine way. So all, so I was kind of again looking at where the stress lies, and it was really in the separation or gender division at school […] and they would ask him to cut his hair short, because he is a boy […] and I think in my report I wrote that… you know, I would really advise you not to address… the pupils as girls and boys, but just call them pupils, students. (Participant C) </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t come across any examples quite so dramatic in my own reporting, but this was a common general storyline: I noted that “Several of the clinicians I spoke with, including Nate Sharon, Laura Edwards-Leeper, and Scott Leibowitz, recounted new patients’ arriving at their clinics, their parents having already developed detailed plans for them to transition. ‘I’ve actually had patients with parents pressuring me to recommend their kids start hormones,’ Sharon said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are gender nonconforming often make adults uncomfortable, and in some cases one way adults attempt to dispel this discomfort is to push for transition. “The [clinical psychologist] participants have the impression that sometimes the school or family expect these young boys to transition to girls,” write Jessen and Roen, “because they do not want them to be feminine boys. This illustrates how difficult it can sometimes be to understand which expectations belong to whom, and how gender non-conforming youth can be referred to the clinic by adults who hold the opinion that gender non-conformity is a problem to be addressed clinically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, as I wrote in my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">article, clinicians told me about instances in which “the child might be capably navigating a liminal period of gender exploration; it’s the parents who are having trouble not knowing whether their kid is a boy or a girl.” Sure enough, this theme of pressure to choose a gender ‘side,’ too, popped up among the Norwegian clinicians:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants were concerned about the possibility that binary gender norms force gender non-conforming youth to become “the opposite gender,” instead of allowing them space to explore their unique gender expression. According to the clinical psychologists interviewed, many clients and families believe that gender is binary, and that there are only two gender identities. This belief does seem to influence clients’ expectations of outcomes, and may encourage them to seek physical treatment at the expense of exploratory work. According to the participants, many clients and their families experience societal and community pressure to conform to gender norms.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration and nuance and liminality are key concepts that come up over and over again in interviews with experienced youth TGNC clinicians. But it can be challenging to tell a child who is in distress, or his or her parents, that it’s worth taking a bit more time to explore before proceeding to physical interventions or making other major decisions about transition — perhaps doubly so given the belief in some quarters that “exploration” or “therapy” are near-synonyms for “transphobia” and “conversion therapy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As “Participant B” told the researchers, “Not surprisingly, exploratory strategies can be aggravating to clients and families. We are always very subject to this discourse of the bigot […] this idea of you know transphobia […] so people that are bigoted are very narrow-minded […] this is where then you know the power that we then have starts to really create lots of tension and problems.” That is, at the end of the day, clinicians stand between young people (and their parents) and medical treatments they feel they need, so it’s an understandable reaction for delays caused by responsible, thorough clinical work to be misread as transphobia. This tension was partly what motivated last year’s practice review in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMJ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Faced with very distressed young people, they [clinicians] may feel under pressure to initiate physical intervention without consultation with psychosocial colleagues,” the review states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If gender clinics in three very different countries with three very different healthcare systems are experiencing the same sorts of scenarios over and over, that’s a signal that everyone should try to better understand what’s going on. Many of the young people mentioned in this study likely will, in the long run, benefit from puberty blockers and hormones. But some won’t — their gender exploration will lead them elsewhere, whether or not they come to identify with their biological sex. It’s important to understand what separates these two groups, and scientists have only barely begun to do so.</span></p>

<h2>Ageing in harmony: why the third act of life should be musical</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-macritchie-171595">Jennifer MacRitchie</a>, <em><a href="http://theconversation.com/institutions/western-sydney-university-1092">Western Sydney University</a></em></p>
<p>It’s never too late to pick up a musical instrument. In fact, there are many reasons why it’s a great idea, particularly in old age.</p>
<p>We normally hear about reasons to increase music education for children, and for good cause. There are <a href="http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/28/3/269">many cognitive and social benefits</a> to playing an instrument that aid a child’s development. Consequently, as an older adult, there are long-term effects of having taken part in these musical activities, as it can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463047">limit cognitive decline</a>.</p>
<p>Even a <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full">small amount of training</a> can have long-lasting effects. But this doesn’t mean that those who have never played an instrument in childhood have missed the boat. The ageing brain is <em>plastic</em>: that means it is able to learn new things all the time. So, should we consider an increase in music programs for those in the third age?</p>
<h2>Playing music as a workout for the brain</h2>
<p>Learning to play a musical instrument is an extremely complex task that involves the coordination of multiple sensory systems within the brain. Many instruments require precise coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands in order to play a musical note. Using the resulting sound as feedback, the brain prepares for the next note and so it continues. The act of music-making is quite a brain workout.</p>
<p>The relationship between the motor and auditory parts of the brain is strengthened when physically playing music. This may explain why adults trained to <em>play</em> certain melodies have an <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/39/9632.long">enhanced representation of music</a> in the brain compared to adults only trained to <em>listen</em> to the same melodies.</p>
<p>As playing music involves many different parts of the brain, even a short-term program for older adult musical novices can lead to generalised improvements for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00810/full">cognitive ability</a>.</p>
<h2>Music as a workout for the fingers</h2>
<p>Learning to play an instrument such as the piano involves many complex finger sequencing and coordination tasks. As such, it can be a great test-bed for learning to move fingers independently.</p>
<p>The creativity of music and the enjoyment people take in playing is particularly important for rehabilitation, as it encourages sustained practice leading ultimately to higher benefits.</p>

<p>It’s thanks to this that piano lessons have been used to successfully retrain hand function for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00662/full">patients who have had a stroke</a>. The immediate auditory feedback from each finger movement is thought to help adults <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721795">reduce errors in movement</a> and work towards moving at a more regular pace.</p>
<p>Music training is an excellent environment to train cognitive and motor abilities, both in the contexts of child development and for rehabilitation. The question for older adults is this: can learning a musical instrument not only put the brakes on cognitive and motor decline but actually allow development of new skills?</p>
<p>Older adults can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1995805/">improve their motor learning</a> – that is, they can improve their rate of learning new things – and the best environments for brain training are ones that are <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00183/full">novel and flexible</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, many activities can be novel such as juggling or knitting, but the advantages of learning an instrument can be found in the breadth of skills required to play. At Western Sydney University, we are currently investigating how piano training can be used with healthy older adults to improve their general hand function in unrelated daily tasks.</p>
<h2>Music for health and wellbeing</h2>
<p>Often, the worry is that playing an instrument will be too difficult for older adults to manage. On the contrary, learning to play an instrument can provide a great sense of <a class="broken_link" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41162324">achievement</a> and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Older adults relish the opportunity to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2014.999361">learn something new</a>.<br />
Cognitive benefits aside, music can also be a great <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02601370.2014.991951">social activity for older adults</a>, facilitating social bonding and decreasing feelings of loneliness or isolation.</p>
<p>Music programs are linked to improvements measured in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005138">markers of the body’s immune system</a> such as the presence of antibodies and vital signs (heart rate/blood pressure).</p>
<p>It’s suggested that this is a consequence of decreases in stress that can happen when taking part in musical activities. However, further research is needed to determine exactly how this relationship functions.</p>
<h2>Music for all</h2>
<p>It’s vital to understand how we can aid the current generation of older adults, in terms of both health and personal enjoyment. With the myriad benefits provided by playing a musical instrument, it would seem beneficial to have a wider variety of musical activities on offer to the older generation.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if the third age wasn’t viewed as a final descent from some mid-life peak, but some new act of life that opens up these opportunities? Perhaps we should give older adults the chance to develop in ways they could never have imagined before.</p>
<p>Activities such as singing in a choir, or playing the piano can provide this opportunity, as well as offering many general benefits to health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So whether it’s in independent living, retirement or assisted care, let’s make the third act of life a musical one!<img alt="The Conversation" height="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/57799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" style="border: none !important; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important;" width="1" /></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>First-hand accounts of what it is like to come close to death often contain the same recurring themes, such as the sense of leaving the body, a review of one’s life, tunnelled vision and a magical sense of reality. Mystics, optimists and people of religious faith interpret this as evidence of an after life. Sceptically minded neuroscientists and psychologists think there may be a more terrestrial neurochemical explanation – that the profound and magical near death experience is caused by the natural release of brain chemicals at or near the end of life.</p>
<p>Supporting this, observers have noted the striking similarities between first-hand accounts of near-death experiences and the psychedelic experiences described by people who have taken mind-altering drugs.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I had the feeling of floating, still tied to the remains of my heavy body, but floating nonetheless. I rocked and moved, at times as if on a liquid, undulating surface, at other times rising upwards, like a helium-filled flat container.” Excerpt from <a href="https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90988">Amazing First-time Experience in the K-hole</a>, published by Phaeton at the Erowid Experience vaults.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, near death, the brain naturally releases the same psychoactive substances as used by drug takers, or substances that act on the same brain receptors as the drugs. It’s also notable that psychedelic drugs have been taken by the shamans of traditional far-flung cultures through history as a way to, as they see it, visit the after world or speak to the dead.</p>
<p>To date, however, much of the evidence comparing near death experiences and psychedelic trips has been anecdotal or it’s been based on questionnaire measures that arguably struggle to capture the complexity of these life-changing experiences. Pursuing this line of enquiry with a new approach, an international team of researchers led by Charlotte Martial at the University Hospital of Liège has conducted a deep lexical analysis, comparing 625 written narrative accounts of near death experiences with more than 15,000 written narrative accounts of experiences taking psychoactive drugs (sourced from the <a href="https://erowid.org/experiences/">Erowid Experience vaults</a>), including 165 different substances in 10 drug classes.</p>
<p><span id="more-36500"></span></p>
<p>The analysis, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381001830535X">published in Consciousness and Cognition</a>, uncovered remarkable similarities between the psychological effects of certain drugs – most of all ketamine, but also notably the serotonergic psychedelic drugs like LSD.  Indeed, the five most common category terms in the narrative accounts of people who’d taken ketamine were the same as the five most common in the near death experience accounts suggesting “shared phenomenological features associated with an altered state of perception of the self and the environment, and a departure from the everyday contents of conscious mentation”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“perception (“face“, “vision“, “saw“), emotion (“fear“), consciousness and cognition (“reality“, “moment“, “universe“, “understand“, “consciousness“, “memory“, “explain“, “learn“), the self and others (“own“, “arm“, “self“, “person“, “human“, “everyone“, “others“) and setting (“door“, “floor“, “inside“, “outside“).”</p></blockquote>
<p>The findings back up the observations of some of the most famous twentieth-century explorers of the psychedelic world – US psychologist Timothy Leary described trips as “experiments in voluntary death” and the British-born writer and philosopher Gerald Heard said of the psychedelic experience, “that’s what death is going to be like. And, oh, what fun it will be!”.</p>
<p>To an extent the results also support neurochemical accounts of near death experience and especially the controversial proposal that such experiences are caused by the natural release of an as-yet-to-be-discovered ketamine-like drug in the brain (adding plausibility to this account, ketamine is known to act on neural receptors that when activated help to prevent cell death and offer protection from lack of oxygen).</p>
<p>As the researchers note wryly, “unlike other human experiences, dying is difficult to study under controlled laboratory conditions by means of repeated measurements” making it a challenge to investigate near-death experiences experimentally. Although the new research lacks laboratory control, on the plus side the lexical comparison Martial’s team conducted is “massive both in terms of the investigated drugs and the number of associated reports”.</p>
<p>The limitations of the current approach, including a reliance on retrospective reports, often decades old, means, as the researchers put it, that they cannot validate nor refute the neurochemical models of near death experiences. “However,” they add, “our results do provide evidence that ketamine, as well as other psychoactive substances, result in a state phenomenologically similar to that of ‘dying’ … This could have important implications for the pharmaceutical induction of near death experience-like states for scientific purposes, as well as for therapeutic uses in the terminally ill as a means to alleviate death anxiety.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/rUHttM1W7TA/">‘How do we define success?’ – Rethinking failure and success in science</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/10/FOI-pic-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Independent of the context, failure is a word that hardly ever leaves us indifferent. Fear of failure is human nature, and it is common that we prefer not to talk about failures if we can avoid it.  When we think about this in a professional context, failure can have clear and immediate ramifications for reputation and career progression and – as with any other professional – researchers are not immune to this fear of failure</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of this approach to failure in research is due to the fact that the research system has traditionally rewarded those who are the first to report a finding over those who are second, and those who report a positive result over those reporting a negative one. However, research generally involves a trial-and-error approach and a plethora of negative findings, or protocols that require troubleshooting before they are fine-tuned. Thus ‘failed’ experiments are common; more so than is often recognized or reported. Much effort and many hours of meticulous research endeavour go unrecognized by the current research assessment frameworks, resulting in a considerable squandering of potentially important research outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failures: Key to success in science’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">event at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas 2018 aimed to reflect on these considerations in a conversation involving our five panelists and the audience around the notions of failure and success in science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our five panellists kicked off the conversation by giving their perspective on what a successful research career should look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How do we define success?’ asked Cathy Sorbara (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-chair of CamAWiSE, Cambridge for Women in Science and Engineering),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintaining that science does not have a defined endpoint, that collaboration should be a key part of the research process, and that scientists need to think about how they communicate their work, particularly to those unfamiliar with research. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapoka Mkandawire (PhD candidate, Sanger Institute) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt that a key aspect of success is to work on something that you feel passionate about and are keen to share. The audience was interested in the forms that communication of research could take and the panellists noted that communication about research should not be restricted to publications, putting forward ideas around visual formats such as videos. Tapoka noted that her research group has developed a </span><a href="http://wormhunters.org/the-comic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comic book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more easily describe their work to children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common theme was that the binary classification of success vs failure is somewhat unfair. Should a result be tagged as failure only because it’s negative and not been published? Fiona Hutton (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head of STM Open Access Publishing at Cambridge University Press) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated the development of a more collaborative open pathway for research, with more openness at all steps of the process, such as that demonstrated with open lab notebooks, to capture the incremental steps that make up the research process. The sharing of negative and null results should be encouraged as well, as a move away from frameworks that rely on impact factors to assess the quality of research; Fiona mentioned <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> as a good initiative in this space, which is gaining support from institutions and funders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arthur Smith (Deputy Manager of Scholarly Communication (Open Access)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> University of Cambridge) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Stephen Eglen (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reader in Computational Neuroscience, University of Cambridge) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tackled the challenges with the current research system and acknowledged that this places Principal Investigators (PIs) as the ‘survivors’ of the system, with only a few reaching the top of a steep pyramidal career structure. Stephen stressed that the driving force for getting into research should be a genuine interest in science and not the goal to eventually become a PI. Arthur noted that there are many other career paths available after a PhD and that the skills gained can be used in many other areas, such as the private sector. The training of PhD students should include aspects that go beyond publishing, and should balance this with the development of communication and other skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To round up the discussion we asked panellists to provide recommendations for steps that can help shift perceptions about success and failure in science. Here is what they told us:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More support for early career researchers, so that they can have an informed, broader view of their career, and of the options after a PhD.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further recognition for the wide range of different roles that scientists play beyond the publication of research findings – for example, peer review activities, mentorship, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provision of credit for recording and reporting troubleshooting, for any work that may not follow the shape of a conventional publication but which would help others engaged in related research.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More training for those in a research path, to help them develop a variety of transferable skills, and to recognize the value of those skills.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased diversity – higher diversity can only be beneficial in driving change towards how success is defined.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieving these aims and helping to sway current views about failures in research represents a formidable task, but – much like science itself – change progresses one step at a time and we hope that the engaging conversation at the Festival of Ideas provided one such step to shift how we define “success” in research. As we pursue initiatives towards such change, let’s remind ourselves of Arthur Smith’s definition of success: ‘Success is what makes you happy’.</span></p>

<p>The famous studies of London’s taxi drivers – showing they have larger hippocampi (the comma-shaped brain structure in the temporal lobes) than controls – have become a staple of undergrad psychology courses and a classic example of how your brain changes according to what you do with it. Many other studies have also implied an association between hippocampal size and navigational ability – for instance, people with Alzheimer’s, who have lost neurons in this brain structure, tend to experience problems finding their way around. For some time, then, an obvious, though tentative, inference has been that better navigators have bigger hippcampi, with London taxi drivers (and their mastery of “the knowledge” of the city’s convoluted streets) and people with Alzheimer’s representing opposite extremes of the spectrum. However, a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/431155v2">new study</a>, released as a preprint at <em>bioRxiv</em>, raises questions about how far we can safely generalise from the taxi driver and Alzheimer’s-based research.</p>
<p>Steven Weisberg and his colleagues tested young adults’ navigation skills and assessed the size of their hippocampi and found the two were not significantly correlated. “The hippocampus plays a crucial role in spatial navigation in humans, but the volume of the hippocampus may not be a biological marker for navigation ability among typical populations,” the researchers concluded.</p>
<p><span id="more-36461"></span></p>
<p>The ninety participants (average age 23; 54 women) had their brains scanned and they completed a range of psychological questionnaires and tests, including a series of computer-based navigation tasks. These navigation tasks required them to learn the routes between buildings in a virtual environment, to point to the location of various buildings, and to drag and drop buildings in the correct location from memory as a way to test their ability to form a cognitive map of the environment.</p>
<p>Critically, the researchers did not find a significant correlation between hippocampi volume and navigation performance, which varied widely across the participants. This was true whether looking at overall hippcampal volume, right hippocampus only or right posterior hippocampus, and remained the case when controlling for differences between participants in other cognitive and demographic factors, such as their mental rotation ability, verbal IQ and gender.</p>
<p>Weisberg and his team believe there are at least three explanations for their null results. First, perhaps the association between hippocampus size and navigation ability only pertains to extreme groups, like taxi drivers and people with Alzheimer’s, and not to the spread of ability in the general population. Second, perhaps hippocampi volume is too crude a measure, with navigational ability depending more on connectivity within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and other relevant brain areas. Last, maybe  hippocampi volume is associated not so much with navigational skill, but the use of particular navigational strategies (raising questions about what kind of cognitive processes exactly the London taxi drivers’ “knowledge” depends on – for instance, the researchers suggested, perhaps it relies not a cognitive map in the usual sense, but rather “an enormous catalogue of associational data”).</p>
<p>Although the new findings represent much needed research on the neural basis of navigational skills among the healthy general population, they are limited by the study’s use of computer-based navigation tasks – it’s possible the results would have been different using a task in the real world. Also, there was no assessment of brain activity and no measure of the kind of navigational strategies the participants used, so we can’t know what part they may have played in the results.</p>
<p>The researchers said future research could address these shortcomings but that as things stand their paper has “implications for the role of the hippocampus in general navigation, and for the extrapolation of findings in expert and impaired groups to healthy, young adults.”</p>
<p>—<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/431155v2">Everyday taxi drivers: Do better navigators have larger hippocampi?</a> [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been peer reviewed and the final published version may differ from the version that this report was based on]</p>

<p>Volker Steuber's journal club session, where he will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this talk, Volker will briefly discuss different forms of neural coding. Volker will focus on temporal coding and summarise John Hopfield's (1995) suggestion how neurons with subthreshold oscillations in their membrane potential could perform scale-invariant temporal encoding of input patterns (and which conditions have to be met for the encoding  to be scale invariant). However, temporal coding is sensitive to noise, and Volker will describe the rank order decoding scheme that was suggested by Simon Thorpe (1998) in order to provide robustness against noise. Furthermore, Volker will outline how Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex could implement a form of rank-order decoding of temporal parallel fibre input patterns.</p>
<p>Volker will reference the following papers:</p>

<h4>A reading guide</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/403/1*DNvVecLKf4jnFIFwNFyfiw.png" /></figure><p>I founded The Spike in 2016 to bring the triumphs and challenges of modern systems neuroscience to a broad audience. Our readers represent a diverse swathe of the scientifically-curious public. We also draw our readers from many fields with an interest in the deep secrets of the brain, from clinicians and neurologists, scientists of all stripes, and researchers in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Reflecting that diverse audience, our essays have covered everything from a primer on dopamine, to the limits of what we can learn from neuroscience experiments. There are rich pickings here for anyone curious about the brain: students looking to understand the cutting edge of neuroscience, to those looking for inspiration for the next generation of AI, to researchers at the forefront of neuroscience looking to see how their work fits into a wider context.</p><p>To help you find your way, here is an A to Z guide to the topics, themes, and subjects we’ve published on in The Spike. (We’ll update this page with every new piece, so check back here!) If nothing else, in compiling this list I learnt a few lessons: how little I write about stuff I work on directly in my day-to-day; that we’ve covered a lot about some things (e.g. cortex) and strangely little of others (e.g. learning); and that Frozen was playing so often in our house at one point that it seeped into everything (see entry: <em>Frozen (Disney)</em>).</p><p>All pieces are

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Loneliness not only feels bad, experts have characterised it as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">a disease</a> that increases the risk of a range of physical and psychological disorders. Some national prevalence estimates for loneliness are alarming. Although they can be as low as 4.4 per cent (in Azerbaijan), in other countries (such as Denmark) as many as 20 per cent of adults report being either moderately or severely lonely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there’s no established way of identifying loneliness. Most diagnostic methods treat it as a one-dimensional construct: though it can vary in degrees, someone is either “lonely”, or they’re not. A new approach, outlined in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-018-1597-8">a paper</a> published recently in <i>Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology</i>, suggests that loneliness should in fact be divided into three sub-types, two of which are associated with poor mental health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36467"></span></p>
<p>Philip Hyland at Trinity College Dublin and colleagues studied a nationally representative sample of 1,839 US adults aged between 18 and 70, all of whom had experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. (This allowed the team to also look for associations between childhood or adult trauma and loneliness.) Most were married or living with a partner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants completed a six-item scale that measured feelings of “social loneliness” (focusing on perceptions of the <i>quantity</i> of one’s social relationships) and “emotional loneliness” (which focused on perceptions of the <i>quality</i> of one’s relationships). They also completed questionnaires assessing levels of childhood and adult trauma, depression and anxiety, and their psychological wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Following convention, the 17.1 per cent of participants who scored a certain amount above the average loneliness score for the sample (by more than one standard deviation)  were classified as “lonely” – a figure comparable to that found previously in many other countries.</p>
<p>However, the researchers also used a statistical technique to look for qualitative differences between the participants’ loneliness responses, and this revealed four distinct classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first class – which they called “low loneliness” – was characterised by low scores on both types of loneliness, social and emotional. Just over half the participants fell into this category. The second class – “social loneliness” – making up 8.2 per cent of the sample, comprised people low on emotional loneliness, but high on social loneliness. The third class – “emotional loneliness” – made up just over a quarter of the total sample and was characterised by the opposite pattern of high emotional loneliness but low levels of social loneliness. People in the fourth and final “social and emotional loneliness” class, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the sample, scored high for both types of loneliness.</p>
<p>The researchers found a clear gradient of psychological distress across the classes. People in the low loneliness class were, predictably, least distressed, followed by people in the “social loneliness” class, then the “emotional loneliness” class, and finally the “social and emotional loneliness” class. In fact, people in both these last two classes had levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and negative psychological wellbeing that were reflective of a psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>In other words, quality of relationships appears more important to mental health than the sheer number of them.“These results indicate that while the experience of social loneliness is associated with slight diminutions in overall mental health, relative to the low loneliness class, the experience of emotional loneliness has a substantially greater, and more negative impact on overall mental health status,” the researchers write. “The combination of social and emotional loneliness is associated with the poorest mental health status,” they note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>People who belonged to the emotional loneliness class were more likely to be female, younger than average for the group, not in a relationship and to have suffered an increased number of childhood traumas. (Every childhood traumatic experience increased the odds of belonging to the emotional loneliness class by 28 per cent.) The same associations were true for the “social and emotional” loneliness class – except they were also characterised by a greater number of adult traumas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At 39.0 per cent, the total percentage of participants who fell into the two loneliness classes characterised by clinically relevant levels of psychological distress was much higher than the 17.1 per cent loneliness figure obtained using the conventional one-dimensional approach. “This finding indicates that by recognising naturally occurring subtypes of loneliness, the number of people experiencing a form… that is likely to be of clinical relevance is more than double the number identified when loneliness is conceptualised as a unidimensional construct,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The work suggests that in assessing loneliness, whether in an individual or at a national level, it’s important to recognise there are various subtypes. It also supports findings from some other studies that it’s the quality, not quantity, of your relationships that really matters. As the researchers conclude: “From a societal perspective, and in the interests of reducing the burden of psychological distress, efforts should be made to enhance the quality of social connections as opposed to promoting the virtues of larger social networks.”</p>

The ultimate goal of invasive recordings is one of direct intervention, by delivering targeted brain stimulation as a treatment. But first you have to establish a firm relationship between neural activity and mood. Well, um, smartphone swipes (the way you interact with your phone) aim to establish a firm relationship between your “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127813/" target="_blank" title="smartphone usage based on not what you type, but how you type and scroll">digital phenotype</a>” and your mood. And then refer you to an app for a precision intervention. Or to your therapist / psychiatrist, who has to buy into use of the digital phenotyping software.<br /><br />On the invasive side of the question, <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/" target="_blank" title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</a> has <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/darpa-allocates-70-million-for.html" target="_blank">invested heavily</a> in deep brain stimulation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation" target="_blank">DBS</a>)  as a treatment for <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-tale-of-two-brains-braini-and-darpas.html" target="_blank">many disorders</a> – Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depression, Borderline  Personality Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Traumatic  Brain Injury, Substance Abuse/Addiction, Fibromyalgia/Chronic  Pain, and <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory" target="_blank">memory loss</a>. None of the work has led to effective treatments (yet?), but the DARPA research model has established large centers of collaborating scientists who record from the brains of epilepsy patients. And a lot of very impressive papers have emerged – some <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/03/automatically-triggered-brain.html" target="_blank">promising</a>, others <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/12/bad-news-for-darpas-ram-program.html" target="_blank">not so much</a>.<br /><br />One recent study (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)31313-8" target="_blank">Kirkby et al., 2018</a>) used machine learning to discover brain networks that encode variations in self-reported mood. The metric was coherence between amygdala and hippocampal activity in the β-frequency (13-30 Hz). I can't do justice to their work in the context of this post, but I'll let the authors' graphical abstract speak for itself (and leave questions like, <i>why did it only work in 13 out of 21 of your participants?</i> for later).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tL2o5JB4l9g/XGu2WFxJRbI/AAAAAAAAMyo/qrXLDNophk8HoFCj8q1J_0j5EWdIfIcrwCLcBGAs/s1600/Graphical%2BAbstract_%2BAmygdala-Hippocampus%2BSubnetwork.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="623" data-original-width="627" height="396" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tL2o5JB4l9g/XGu2WFxJRbI/AAAAAAAAMyo/qrXLDNophk8HoFCj8q1J_0j5EWdIfIcrwCLcBGAs/s400/Graphical%2BAbstract_%2BAmygdala-Hippocampus%2BSubnetwork.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Mindstrong </b><br /><br />Then along comes a startup tech company called <a href="https://mindstronghealth.com/" target="_blank">Mindstrong</a>, whose <a href="https://mindstronghealth.com/team/tom-insel-md/" target="_blank">Co-Founder and President</a> is none other than Dr. Thomas Insel, former director of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Mental_Health" title="National Institute of Mental Health">NIMH</a>, and one of the chief architects<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span> of the Research Domain Criteria (<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml" target="_blank">RDoC</a>), “a research framework for new approaches to investigating mental disorders” that eschews the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">DSM-5</a> diagnostic bible.

Thus, clinical investigators were forced to make up simplistic biological explanations for their psychosocial interventions:<br /><br />“I hypothesize that the circuit mechanism for my elaborate new psychotherapy protocol which eliminates fear memories (e.g., specific phobias, PTSD) is implemented by down-regulation of amygdala activity while participants view pictures of fearful faces using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10683827" target="_blank" title="Modulating emotional responses: effects of a neocortical network on the limbic system (Hariri et al. 2000)">Hariri task</a>.”<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s1600/Hariri%2Btask.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="409" data-original-width="432" height="302" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s320/Hariri%2Btask.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span>[a fictitious example]</span></div><br /><br />I'm including a substantial portion of the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2014/a-new-approach-to-clinical-trials.shtml" target="_blank">February 27, 2014 text</a> here because it's important. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>NIMH is making three important changes to how we will fund clinical trials.</b><br /><br />First, future trials will follow an experimental medicine approach in which interventions serve not only as potential treatments, but as probes to generate information about the mechanisms underlying a disorder. <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>Trial proposals will need to identify a target or mediator; a positive result will require not only that an intervention ameliorated a symptom, but that it had a demonstrable effect on a target, such as a neural pathway implicated in the disorder or a key cognitive operation. </b></span>While experimental medicine has become an accepted approach for drug development, we believe it is equally important for the development of psychosocial treatments. It offers us a way to understand the mechanisms by which these treatments are leading to clinical change. </blockquote><br />OK, so the target <i><b>could</b></i> be a key cognitive operation. But let's say your intervention is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/communities/homelessness/housing-first.html" target="_blank">Housing First</a> initiative in homeless individuals with severe mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse.

What is the key cognitive operation here? Fortunately, this project was funded by the Canadian government and did not need to compete for NIMH funding.<br /><br />I think my ultimate issue is one of fundamental fairness. Is it OK to skate away from the wreckage and profit by making millions of dollars? From <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/star-neuroscientist-tom-insel-leaves-google-spawned-verily-startup/" target="_blank"><i>Wired</i></a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and  genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that I realize  that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers  published by cool scientists at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I  don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing  hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people  who have mental illness,” Insel says. “I hold myself accountable for  that.” </blockquote><br />But how? You've admitted to spending $20 billion on cool projects and cool papers and cool scientists who do basic research. This has great value.

<p><em>By</em> guest blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/rhi_willmot?lang=en">Rhiannon Willmot</a></p>
<p>Philosophers have long debated what constitutes genuine altruism. Some have argued that any acts, no matter however charitable, that benefit both the actor as well as the recipient, are altruistically “impure”, and thus can’t qualify as genuinely selfless. For example, volunteering at a soup kitchen would no longer be considered altruistic if we received a hot meal in return for our efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, other scholars have argued that the act remains altruistic if the benefits of prosocial behaviour are an unintended consequence. From this perspective, if the meal is unexpected, our actions are still deemed selfless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117301701">recent paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em> Ryan Carlson and Jamil Zaki have shed light on these questions by investigating what the general population thinks of different prosocial acts, depending on their motives and consequences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Understanding popular perceptions of prosocial behavior can not only help resolve the altruism debate, but also provide information about how our behaviour might be viewed by others, and whether our personal opinions on selflessness match up with the general belief. For example, why might we perceive the supposedly altruistic behaviour of a public figure differently to our friends, and is social media really the right place to publicise prosocial acts?</p>
<p><span id="more-36423"></span></p>
<p>The researchers first asked 270 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website to rate how altruistic they perceived behaviours in eight hypothetical scenarios. Participants in one group received only a description of the scenario (“Jane gives blood at a local clinic”), whereas participants in two other groups were also informed about what motivated the act (“Jane gives blood in order to impress her friends”), or about the consequences for the actors (“Jane gives blood, and impresses her friends”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants told about the actor’s motives were influenced dramatically by what they read. They condemned behaviours driven by material or social gain as actively selfish, and even acting altruistically as a way to derive emotional benefit (for instance, to feel good) they viewed as significantly less altruistic than purely other-oriented activity. This suggests we discredit individuals who anticipate some kind of reward as a result of their prosocial behaviour, and that we are particularly harsh when this relates to receiving material gifts, or impressing others.</p>
<p>Hearing about consequences made less difference to participants’ judgments. However, they did rate behaviours that reaped material or social gain as slightly less altruistic than behaviours that obtained emotional rewards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting results was that participants rated the same prosocial act as equally altruistic whether they were told explicitly that it had been carried out purely to help others or they were not given any information about motives. This contradicts the idea that people are naturally sceptical, and actually suggests we are likely to assume prosocial behaviour is carried out selflessly by default.</p>
<p>In a second study, Carlson and Zaki repeated their original experiment with more participants, and introduced a fourth group to investigate the role of neutral actions, such as going to the cinema. The results of study 1 were replicated, however Carlson and Zaki also found that if a prosocial action (that benefited others) was performed for material or social benefit then it was actually seen as less altruistic than neutral actions (that didn’t benefit others).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest the precise motive for an act, rather than its consequence, is the main factor in determining whether we perceive the act as altruistic or not. This effect is so powerful in fact that it can lead us to define certain types of prosocial behaviour as less altruistic than actions which provide no benefits to others at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why does this perception exist? Carlson and Zaki conclude that our social judgments are influenced more by what drives people to act than the consequences they receive. This is because we use perceived motives to predict future behaviour. Those who are only prosocial under certain conditions are less reliable, and performing outwardly selfless acts for selfish reasons might even represent a deceptive and dangerous character.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results of the current work leave several avenues for further research. For example, it would be interesting to discover how judgements of altruism differ in populations who value the relative importance of intentions and consequences differently from the average perception, such as those with autism.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now these recent findings suggest that if you promote your charitable efforts on twitter, you could be viewed as less altruistic than someone who isn’t involved with prosocial behaviour at all. Ultimately, this comes down to whether we are viewed as seeking social glory, versus recruiting others to join a charitable cause. Whilst it seems humans take altruistic acts at face value when given no context, it is the appearance of our motive for acting that is key.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>As the list of failed replications <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/">continues to build</a>, psychology’s reproducibility crisis is becoming harder to ignore. Now, in a new paper that seems likely to ruffle a few feathers, researchers suggest that even many apparent successful replications in neuroimaging research could be standing on shaky ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the paper’s title bluntly puts it, the way imaging results are currently analysed “allows presenting anything as a replicated finding.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The provocative argument is put forward by YongWook Hong from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea and colleagues, in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514521v1">preprint posted recently to bioRxiv</a>. The fundamental problem, say the researchers, is that scientists conducting neuroimaging research tend to make and test hypotheses with reference to large brain structures. Yet neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), gather data at a much more fine-grained resolution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This means that strikingly different patterns of brain activity could produce what appears to be the same result. For example, one lab might find that a face recognition task activates the amygdala (a structure found on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotional processing). Later, another lab apparently replicates this finding, showing activation in the same structure during the same task. But the amygdala contains hundreds of individual “voxels”, the three-dimensional pixels that form the basic unit of fMRI data. So the second lab could have found activity in a completely different part of the amygdala, yet it would appear that they had replicated the original result.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36458"></span></p>
<p>The authors’ arguments are not simply theoretical: in a series of experiments, Hong and colleagues demonstrate that replications are not always what they seem. The team used an imaging dataset they’d collected and published in a previous study, which examined the similarity of the brain’s responses to physical pain and social rejection. First, they divided the data into two groups, containing 30 and 29 participants respectively. For the sake of their demonstration, they pretended that these groups were two separate cohorts, the first group the “original” cohort, and the second a cohort used for a replication attempt.</p>
<p>Following the kind of approach typically used in many neuroimaging experiments and replication attempts, they then examined the brain activity exhibited in response to rejection and pain in each of these groups, focusing on an area in the front of the brain called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The first group showed increased activity in the dACC to both rejection and pain – and so did the second, suggesting that the initial result had been successfully replicated.</p>
<p>But when the team looked within the dACC to see where in the structure activation was strongest, they found that the groups differed considerably. For the social rejection condition in particular, the location of this “peak” activation for the second group was a whopping 43mm away from the peak for the first group, at the opposite end of the dACC. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results might seem to suggest that the location of peak activation could provide a better indication of whether a finding has replicated than looking at average activity levels across a brain area. But in a subsequent experiment, the authors found that the location of peak activation didn’t actually have much bearing on the overall <i>pattern</i> of activity. That is, there was a lot of information about the underlying distribution of activity that wasn’t captured by only looking at the peaks either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors say that pattern-based analysis methods are a better option for figuring out whether or not a result has been replicated. Rather than simply looking at the average activity across a brain structure or where peak activation is, this kind of analysis uses information about the distribution of activity across many voxels and brain regions. This would allow researchers to directly compare the similarity of overall patterns of activity between studies. Alongside other improved methods of analysis, the authors say, “these practices will provide researchers with more robust spatial tests, helping us move one step towards resolving the current replication crisis in neuroimaging studies.”</p>
<p>But they may be facing an uphill battle. In a survey of 135 previously published papers that claimed to have successfully replicated previous findings, Hong and his colleagues found that 85.3 per cent based their conclusions merely on finding activity in the same brain region as the original study, and more than 40 per cent didn’t even compare peak co-ordinates. A meagre 7.4 per cent conducted the kind of pattern-based analysis that the Hong’s team recommend. This suggests that it may be a while before the authors see their recommendations put into practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
