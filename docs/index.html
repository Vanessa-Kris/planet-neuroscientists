A special instance of reverse inter-metamorphosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_lycanthropy" target="_blank">clinical lycanthropy</a>, the delusion that one has been transformed into a wolf (or another animal). A recent review identified 43 cases in the literature between 1852 and today (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.718101/full" target="_blank">Guessoum et al., 2021</a>).

The wolf has different characteristics and symbolic meanings across various cultures. As in other realms, popular media and folklore shape the content of the delusion. Occasionally, there may be a literal event that triggers the belief of transmogrification. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Clinical Kynanthropy After a Dog Bite</b><br /></p><p>This case report of kynanthropy <span><span>—</span></span> delusional transformation into a dog <span><span>—</span></span> was notable because the COVID-19 lockdown might have exacerbated the condition.  The patient was a 28-year-old single male who started grinning, barking, and walking on four legs after being bitten by a dog... but not until two years later (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02537176211047132" target="_blank">Jain et al., 2021</a>). <br /></p><p></p><blockquote>He was apparently alright until two months before the presentation, when, due to the COVID-19-related nationwide lockdown, he read excessively on the internet about dog bites. ... he developed a feeling that his tongue is moving like a dog’s and began having repetitive thoughts about converting into a dog. Gradually, his sleep reduced to 1–2 hours/day, and he expressed fear that if he sleeps, he might get up as a dog. He sought repeated reassurance from his family that he hasn’t transformed into a dog, to the extent that they got irritated and asked him to see a doctor. These repetitive thoughts would be present for the whole day, and he would chant God's name to get relief from them. </blockquote><p></p><p><br /><span></span></p><p>The man had no history of rabies, mood disorder, or substance use. Upon examination, he was anxious but did not present with depression or psychotic features. Instead, he had repetitive doubts about turning into a dog. The patient was diagnosed with moderate OCD (with poor insight) and given a prescription of 20 mg fluoxetine (Prozac). A month later, he reported improvement in his repetitive thoughts, and at three months showed an improvement in social and occupational function. He realized he had spent way too much time on the internet reading and watching videos about dog bites.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; <br /><span></span></p><p></p><p><b>Botanical Inter-metamorphosis</b> <br /></p>A unique arboreal delusion was briefly described in a recent abstract (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/xylological-variant-of-reverse-fregoli-syndrome-delusions-of-being-a-tree/89B04E3D281484E02E9FBC7FB8FE6580" target="_blank">Bakhshi &amp; Hirsch, 2021</a>): a depressed young woman believed she had been transformed into a tree. The major manifestations were standing still for long periods of time and repeating, "I am a tree." <br /><p></p><blockquote>A 21-year-old right-handed cisgender female, two months prior to presentation, noted stiffness and difficulty with ambulation. One-month prior to admission, she experienced recurrent depression with myriad vegetative and nonvegetative symptoms of depression. On admission her chief complaint was "I am a tree", standing motionless and minimally responding to query. After treatment with quetiapine, mirtazapine and hydroxyzine for a one-week period, her perception of being a tree fully resolved.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The authors considered a range of delusional diagnoses for her condition:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><u>Cotard’s syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> think she was dead <br /></li><li><u>Ekbom syndrome</u> (delusional parasitosis) – NO, she did <i>not</i> think her body was infested with bugs</li><li><u>Reverse Inanimate Capgras Syndrome</u> – MAYBE? (but "instead of an imposter replacing a close friend, who then is inserted into the sufferer; a tree has replaced the sufferer.")</li><li><u>Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, misindentification of another, <i>not</i> self</li><li><u>Botanical Intermetamorphosis</u> – NO, another person transformed into a plant, <i>not </i>self <br /></li><li><u>Reverse Intermetamorphosis</u> – MAYBE? ("However, in this situation, the objects are all human or animate animals not botanicals.")  – <i>but isn't this the point, to report on a botanical?</i> <br /></li><li><u>Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, altered physical identity of another, <i>not </i>self<br /></li><li><u>Reverse Fregoli syndrome</u> – NO, patient assumes the physical identity of another person, <i>not</i> a plant </li><li><u>Botanical Variant of Interparietal Syndrome</u> – NO, she did <i>not</i> have parietal lobe damage. ("In this condition, parts of the body are perceived to be lifeless, due to lesions of the inferior parietal lobe...")</li></ul><p><br />The groundbreaking conclusion was that doctors should check for delusions involving plant life in all of these syndromes, because botanical variants have not been described before.</p><p>&nbsp;<br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/werewolves-of-london-ontario.html">Werewolves of London, Ontario</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/10/haunting-delusions-of-identity.html">Haunting Delusions of Identity</a><br /><br />  <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/ophidianthropy-delusion-of-being.html">Ophidianthropy: The Delusion of Being Transformed into a Snake</a> <br /><br /> <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/psychopharmacology-of-lycanthropy.html">Psychopharmacology of Lycanthropy</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/10/oldest-remaining-werewolf-movie.html">The oldest remaining werewolf movie&nbsp;</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/s268/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="160" data-original-width="268" height="191" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ADjNhrz9i_Y/YX9Np671nvI/AAAAAAAANbY/J7hUrOGpAOcw7hGtth2AezeWeUlPbg5XACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h191/Keanu%2Bthe%2Bdog%2Bboy%2Bin%2Bwhite%2Buniform.webp" width="320" /></a></div><p></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: arial;">Keanu Reeves as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/comments/9ff679/probably_keanus_least_known_but_imo_funniest_role/" target="_blank">Ortiz the Dog Boy</a> in <i>Freaked</i></span></b></div><p><br /><br /><b>References</b> <br /><br />Bakhshi HS, Hirsch AR.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-kids-5-11-pfizer-parents-questions">What parents need to know about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11</a></h4>

              
                <p>Five to 11-year-olds are a step closer to being eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug  Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the vaccine on October 29. That authorization had passed its first hurdle a few days ago when an FDA advisory panel gave their thumbs-up to make Pfizer’s and its German partner BioNTech’s vaccine available to 5- to 11-year-olds.  </p>



<p>Advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet November 2 to discuss authorization and develop recommendations for the vaccine&#8217;s use in this age group. The shots could be available as early as next week.</p>



<p>The decision to endorse emergency use authorization of the vaccine followed an extensive discussion among experts on the FDA panel, who were tasked with determining if the vaccine’s benefits outweigh the risks. </p>





<p>Many panelists, for instance, expressed concerns about myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis has been an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis">uncommon, but potentially serious, side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines</a>, primarily in male adolescents and young adults <em>(SN: 6/23/21</em>). Other experts emphasized that while children are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than adults, kids aren’t spared from the worst of the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer for vaccine policy at the CDC, the answer is clear: the benefits outweigh the risks. “We don’t want children to be dying of COVID, even if it is far fewer children than adults,” she said. “And we don’t want them in the ICU.” </p>



<p>FDA Advisory Committee member and pediatrician Jay Portnoy said at the meeting that Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., where he works, has been full for the last month or so, and many of the admitted kids have COVID-19. “I’m looking forward to being able to actually do something to prevent that,” he said.</p>

<p>And for children who have spent much of the last two years facing disrupted school and social lives, vaccination is a step toward normalcy. “It’s really to allow kids the freedom to be kids and do all the things comfortably that kids do,” Emmanuel Walter Jr., a pediatrician at Duke University School of Medicine and chief medical officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute said in an October 27 news briefing. Once vaccinated, children can go to school, play sports and “do the normal things kids want to do.”</p>



<p>Vaccinations are key to preventing disease, in adults and kids. Here’s what to know about kids, COVID-19 and the Pfizer vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How has COVID-19 affected 5- to 11-year-olds?</h4>



<p>As of October 28, 171 children <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">in this age group in the United States have died of COVID-19</a>, according to CDC’s COVID data tracker. Looking at the top 10 causes of death for children in 2019, COVID-19 would be eighth on that list, said Fiona Havers, a medical officer with the CDC’s COVID-19 Public Health Response during a presentation at the FDA meeting. More than 8,300 kids ages 5 to 11 have been hospitalized so far, and about a third of those needed intensive care, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inequities that have been seen throughout the pandemic have not spared younger children. Among 5- to 11-year-olds, the hospitalization rate is three times as high for Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native children as it is for white children, Havers said. Advisory committee member and immunologist James Hildreth, who is president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said the primary reason for his yes vote was to make sure that “the children who really need this vaccine, primarily the Black and brown children in this country, get the vaccine.”</p>



<p>The overall rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 for 5- to 11-year-olds roughly matches what was seen for influenza seasons before the pandemic. But that’s with masking, school closures and other public health measures. Without those precautions, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate may be higher than that seen in past flu seasons, Havers said.</p>



<p>More than 5,000 children who were infected with the coronavirus have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which causes severe inflammation throughout the body. Of those reported cases, 39 percent were among children ages 6 to 11, Havers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.15870">can also experience long COVID</a>, in which symptoms such as fatigue, cough, headaches, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and pain in the muscles and joints persist after being sick. These continued symptoms can limit activity and impact mental health and school attendance. Long COVID can occur after mild or severe disease or following MIS-C. It’s still unclear how many children have been affected by long COVID. One estimate, from a survey by the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics, reported that 7 to 8 percent of U.K. children who had gotten COVID-19 still had symptoms more than 12 weeks after being diagnosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COVID-19 has severely disrupted children’s lives beyond its capacity to cause illness. Children have been kept out of school, which has stalled the education of many kids, and for many has meant missing out on regular meals. School closures that happened during just a few months, from August to October of 2021, as the delta variant was surging, affected more than 1 million students in the United States. We don’t yet know the extent of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">educational and emotional toll</a> school closures have taken on children (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>).</p>





<h4>How was the vaccine evaluated?</h4>



<p>In a clinical trial, Pfizer assessed the immune response and the safety of their mRNA vaccine in kids 5 to 11. The trial included about 2,250 children, with two-thirds getting the shot and the other third receiving a placebo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An earlier study had determined that this age group had a good immune response to a smaller dose, two shots of 10 micrograms, compared with the 30-microgram-per-shot dose given to adolescents and adults. Children’s immune systems tend to respond well to vaccines, so to avoid unnecessarily strong symptoms after a shot, such as high fevers or excessive achiness, the goal with the smaller dose is to hit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer">the right sweet spot between a protective immune response and side effects</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/21</em>).</p>



<h4>How well does the vaccine work?</h4>



<p>The data suggest the vaccine works very well for this age group.</p>



<p>Pfizer assessed kids’ immune response to the vaccine by looking at antibody levels. The company compared the response in a group of 5- to 11-year-olds one month after the second shot with antibody levels seen in a group of 16- to 25-year-olds, who were part of the earlier and much larger <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean">clinical trial that studied the vaccine’s efficacy</a> in tens of thousands of adults (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). There was no difference in the immune responses between the different groups, even though the younger children received a smaller dose, the FDA reported in their review of Pfizer’s trial data. Since the immune response was similar between the two groups, the protection against COVID-19 offered by the vaccine for each group should also be similar.</p>



<p>Pfizer also looked at how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases occurred at least a week after the second shot in children who were vaccinated compared with those who received the placebo. Three of 1,450 vaccinated children developed the disease, while 16 of 736 unvaccinated did, which Pfizer reports as an efficacy of 90 percent. None of the children in the trial had severe COVID-19 or MIS-C.</p>

<h4>What are the side effects?</h4>



<p>In the clinical trial, common side effects were redness, swelling and pain at the site of the injection in the arm, as well as headache and fatigue. There were no cases of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-severe-allergic-reactions-extremely-rare-cdc">anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction</a> that was reported, though rarely, when the Pfizer vaccine was first given to adults outside clinical trials (<em>SN: 1/6/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What about heart inflammation called myocarditis?</h4>



<p>No cases of myocarditis occurred in kids ages 5 to 11 in the follow-up period, three months after vaccination. But with the possibility that this rare complication could occur once the vaccine is used in larger numbers, weighing the risk of myocarditis against the benefits of being protected against COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death took up much of the discussion at the FDA’s advisory panel meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tens of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given to 12- to 29-year-olds. Of 877 confirmed myocarditis cases in this group and 829 hospitalized, there have been no deaths. As of October 6, 607 of 789 adolescents and young adults discharged from the hospital are known to have recovered from their symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Myocarditis can also occur with COVID-19. Patients <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm">with the disease had 16 times the risk for myocarditis</a> as patients without the disease, according to a study of U.S. hospital data from March 2020 to January 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA and CDC have several post-vaccine safety surveillance systems in place. “We will continue to actively look for adverse events,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Md., at the advisory meeting. The CDC and the FDA “are incredibly committed and devoted” to catching any safety issues as soon as possible, he said.</p>



<p>When myocarditis occurs in the general population, due to infection or other causes, it tends to happen after puberty. Based on the lower typical rate for younger kids and the lower vaccine dose that this group will receive, “I am not as concerned about myocarditis,” said Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta. Authorizing the vaccine “is a good move forward for COVID prevention and for protecting our kids.”</p>



<h4>How can parents be sure children are getting the correct, smaller dose?</h4>



<p>The vials of Pfizer vaccine intended for those 12 and older have a purple cap and purple lettering on the label.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help make sure that 5- to 11-year-olds get the right vial, the company has changed the color scheme to orange.</p>



<h4>Should 11-year-olds wait until their 12th birthday to get the same dose that adults do?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>“I would not wait,” said Walter, the Duke pediatrician, who was involved in the clinical trial for Pfizer’s vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because even with the lower dose of the vaccine, 11-year-olds developed lots of antibodies. Data presented during the October 26 FDA advisory meeting show that 5- to 11-year-olds had similar antibody levels as older age groups a month after the second dose. “I’m confident they’ll have the same protection” as 12-year-olds, Walter said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How can parents prepare kids to get the vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The shots can have typical side effects like fever or fatigue. So it may be worth telling children that they might feel achy, have a headache or just not feel good overall for the next day or so, Walter said. “That’s to be expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those symptoms are usually pretty mild. But some kids may end up with stronger side effects, such as feeling more fatigued, than others. If your child does end up feeling crummy, Walter said, it’s OK to use pain medication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/29/young-people-around-the-world-report-high-levels-of-climate-anxiety/">Young People Around The World Report High Levels Of Climate Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In the past few years, the effects of climate change have become undeniably apparent. In the last two years alone, headlines have been full of climate disasters — from forest fire smoke turning San Francisco&#8217;s sky luminous red, to torrential flooding in Germany and China.</p>



<p>In the face of events like this, anxiety and fear about climate change is undoubtedly increasing. Far from being indicative of mental illness, climate anxiety (also known as eco-anxiety or climate distress) more neatly fits under the banner of “practical anxiety”: fear that motivates change to help us respond to threats. Even though this in itself is useful, the experiences of fear can be unrelenting, and have serious consequences for mental health and functioning.</p>



<p>Young people are more at risk than those from older generations; an uncertain and dangerous climate situation poses the most risk to their futures, after all.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Caroline Hickman and colleagues at the University of Bath set out to investigate the extent of young people’s feelings and thoughts on climate change, and the functional impact associated with them. In their global study, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955">posted as a preprint at SSRN,</a> they look how the threats of climate change, as well as government response to these threats, affect the emotions and day to day functioning of young people.</p>



<span id="more-44282"></span>



<p>Ten thousand participants aged between 16 and 25 years old were recruited via an online survey portal. These participants were based in ten different countries from around the world, as far flung as Australia, Brazil, India, and Finland. All completed a measure of climate anxiety constructed specifically for this study by 11 experts in relevant areas of psychology and law. Participants were not made aware of the topic of the survey before starting.</p>



<p>The measure itself contained eight broad sections; these related to worry about climate change, its impact on their functioning, emotions and thoughts about climate change, as well as feelings of being ignored on the topic, beliefs about government response to the threat, and the emotional impact of that response. In order to more closely investigate particular constructs, such as negative feelings about climate change or negative thoughts about government response, the team also condensed scores from relevant items across these sections during their analyses. And, last but not least, emotional impacts of government responses were split into two scales — the reassurance scale, and the betrayal scale — to allow closer analysis of positive and negative feelings, respectively.</p>



<p>Across all countries, the majority of participants (60%) reported feeling “very” or “extremely” worried about climate change. More than 45% reported that these feelings negatively impacted their daily lives. By country, those expressing the highest amount of worry tended to be from poorer regions, in the Global South, and those who had been more directly impacted by climate change. For example Portugal, where there have in recent years been extensive wildfires, rated highest for worry amongst its neighbours in the Global North.</p>



<p>Participants reported a wide range of negative emotions: 77% said the future was frightening, and over 50% had felt afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty about climate change. Optimism and indifference, unfortunately, were not often reported. When talking to others about climate change, almost half of participants said their concerns had been ignored or dismissed.</p>



<p>When it came to rating government response, participants were generally unimpressed. Over 60% of respondents disagreed with every positive statement about their government’s climate action, though this did vary significantly between countries. Across all regions, however, feelings of betrayal were higher than those of reassurance.</p>



<p>Correlational analyses indicated close positive relationships between negative thoughts, worry about climate change, and impact on functioning. These factors also correlated strongly with feelings of government betrayal and negative beliefs about their response to the climate threats at hand, suggesting that those who believed the government to be underperforming in their response to climate change experienced more negative psychological consequences. In many, this is likely to constitute Moral Injury – significant psychological distress caused by witnessing a traumatic event that runs against the viewer’s morals, that they are powerless to stop. Not only can Moral Injury further increase mental health risks, the authors say, but it could also open the door to lawsuits based on psychological harm.</p>



<p>The measure used in this study was not standardised, as no suitable measure existed previously, meaning further investigation as to its validity would likely be beneficial. And of course, the data is correlational, meaning that no conclusions about causality can be drawn from this data (no matter how intuitive they may feel).</p>



<p>Even so, taken together, the data collected in study stands as firm evidence that climate anxiety is evident across the globe. This continued stress on the younger members of our populations severely affects their emotions and ability to function day-to-day. Given the timescale of issues at hand, it’s easy to imagine how the rapidly increasing threats of climate change could give rise to mental health issues among many young people, especially if governments continue to fail in their responses. Further research into these climate-specific stressors as precursors to mental health issues in young people will likely illuminate this relationship further.</p>



<p>The authors say that their results also demonstrate the point that climate anxiety isn’t simply caused by ecological catastrophe: it’s also directly related to government inaction. Greater levels of action and commitment by governments can not only enable us to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century, it also has the potential to improve the mental wellbeing of citizens around the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/math-equation-describes-bird-eggs-all-shapes-found-mystery">An elusive equation describing bird eggs of all shapes has been found at last</a></h4>

              
                <p>For years, scientists have tried to crack a mathematical mystery: Is there an equation that can perfectly describe each and every bird egg? Variable shell shapes complicated things. But it turns out the answer is simple. A formula using just four easily measured dimensions can calculate the shape of any avian egg, be it round as a ping-pong ball, a smooshed sphere, oblong or a curvaceous pear, researchers report in an upcoming issue of the <em>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>It was that last shape that had eluded the eggs-perts. They found themselves yoked to an equation that couldn’t accurately describe pyriform, or conical, eggs. Previously, researchers developed an equation that accounted for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flight-demands-may-have-steered-evolution-bird-egg-shape">spherical brown hawk owl eggs</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>), elliptical <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eggs-evolved-color-and-speckles-only-once-during-dinosaur-age">emu eggs</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/18</em>), ovoid osprey eggs and other similarly shaped eggs. &nbsp;But that formula didn’t apply to the pear-shaped eggs from birds like great snipes and King penguins.</p>



<p>The new formula needs four inputs: the egg’s length, its maximum breadth, its diameter at the spot where its pointed end terminates and the location of its maximum diameter in relationship to the midpoint of its length. Adding one additional function and incorporating that last diameter variable to existing egg math led to the universal equation.</p>



<p>The finding could have real-life implications, says Darren Griffin, a geneticist at the University of Kent in England, who did the work along with Kent biologist Michael Romanov and Valeriy Narushin, an agricultural engineer formerly at Kent. For example, being able to calculate an egg’s shape could help designers create better padded or form-fitting egg containers, minimizing grocery store waste or that disappointing moment of arriving home with a carton of eggs, opening the lid and finding your eggs cracked. “We’re all supposed to check in the box” before leaving the store, but it’s easy to forget, says Griffin.</p>





<p>The equation could also come in handy in conservation efforts. When reintroducing a bird species, “one of the considerations would be ‘How likely are the eggs to break?’” Griffin says. Knowing an egg’s math could help researchers calculate what parts are most vulnerable to cracking, which in turn could help them assess where and how best to place them in certain habitats to help grow the population in those areas.</p>



<p>The formula’s simplicity “makes this approach practical for field studies” and could even enable researchers to collect the measurements from digital photographs, says Mark Hauber, an ornithologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “My lab had been working on something like this, but we weren’t able to derive the new math.” His recent <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201615">work</a> has focused on determining “how birds themselves can tell if an object is naturally egg-shaped or an artificial shape that shares some of the geometry with natural eggs.”</p>



<p>The discovery of the egg equation came while the researchers were exploring how to nondestructively assess the sexes of avian embryos before eggs are incubated. They were looking for physical differences between the attributes of eggs containing female and male embryos, Narushin says. The universal formula is an initial step in “resolving such an enigma.” Now they’re working on a new brood of egg problems, searching for a universal formula for computing the volume and surface area of various eggs, as well as exploring “mathematical shell secrets,” such as why shell thickness differs by species. &nbsp;</p>

Thus it is definitely a book that requires no background in neuroscience.</p> <p>The key theme is that feelings and emotions are foundational aspects of Consciousness.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hQF511" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Feeling & Knowing: Making Minds Conscious</em></a> by Antonio Damasio</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3c61NiV" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Self Comes to Mind</em></a> by Antonio Damasio (<a href= "http://www.brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/review-of-self-comes-to-mind-by-antonio-damasio-bsp-90.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BS 90</a>)</li> <li><a href= "https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1008328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antonio Damasio, MD, PhD</a>, Professor USC <ul> <li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/damasiousc" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@damasiousc</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Please visit <a href= "http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additional references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> <p> </p> Please Visit Our Sponsors <ul> <li><a title="TextExpander" href= "https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=textexpander-October-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextExpander at textexpander.com/podcast</a></li> </ul> <p> Announcements:</p> <ul> <li>Autographed copies of <a href= "https://brainsciencepodcast.com/books"><em>Are You Sure?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-nasa-meteor-strikes-mars">What the Perseverance rover’s quiet landing reveals about meteor strikes on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lander was listening. On February 18, NASA’s InSight lander on Mars turned its attention to the landing site for another mission, Perseverance, hoping to detect its arrival on the planet.</p>



<p>But InSight heard nothing.</p>



<p>Tungsten blocks ejected by Perseverance during entry landed hard enough to create craters on the Martian surface. Collisions like these — whether from space missions or meteor strikes — send shock waves through the ground. Yet in the first experiment of its kind on another world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01502-0">InSight failed to pick up any seismic waves from the blocks’ impacts</a>, researchers report October 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>As a result, researchers think that less than 3 percent of the energy from the impacts made its way into the Martian surface. The intensity of impact-generated rumblings varies from planet to planet and is “really important for understanding how the ground will change from a big impact event,” says Ben Fernando, a geophysicist at the University of Oxford.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="266" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline.jpg" alt="photos of crater on Mars" class="wp-image-3105306" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102721_FK_silent-mars_inline-330x129.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105306">Perseverance left behind several craters (one indicated with the arrow) after pieces of the mission disengaged as planned during entry, creating a rare opportunity to see how Mars absorbs energy from impacts.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105306">Univ. of Arizona, JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But getting these measurements is tricky. Scientists need sensitive instruments placed relatively near an impact site. Knowing when and where a meteor will strike is nearly impossible, especially on another world.</p>



<p>Enter Perseverance: a hurtling space object set <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">to hit Mars at an exact time and place</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). To help with its entry, Perseverance dropped about 78 kilograms of tungsten as the rover landed about 3,450 kilometers from InSight. The timing and weight of the drop provided a “once-in-a-mission opportunity” to study the immediate seismic effects of an impact from space, Fernando says.</p>



<p>The team had no idea whether InSight would be able to detect the blocks’ impacts or not, but the quiet arrival speaks volumes. “It lets us put an upper limit on how much energy from the tungsten blocks turned into seismic energy,” Fernando says. “We’ve never been able to get that number for Mars before.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/intellectual-humility-science-research-results-psychology">Scientists should report results with intellectual humility. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the children’s chapter book series <em>Zoey and Sassafras</em>, which my own two kids adore, young Zoey has to work out how to save magical creatures with mysterious injuries and ailments. Zoey’s scientist mother teaches her the basics of running an experiment: Observe, hypothesize, test and conclude. Throughout the series, Zoey learns that failed experiments, while disappointing, are simply part of the scientific process.</p>



<p>Schoolteachers similarly encourage most budding scientists to be open to making mistakes and refining ideas — to be like Zoey. In theory, then, this humble thinking should remain foundational as students become established scientists. Yet, in an October 28 commentary in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, psychologists Rink Hoekstra and Simine Vazire argue that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01203-8">the practice of science</a>, particularly the process of publishing findings in scientific journals, is far from this “tell it as it is” style. It’s more arrogant.</p>



<p>“I think implicitly we are taught to brag about our results,” says Hoekstra, of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Hoekstra and Vazire, of the University of Melbourne in Australia, propose scientists should be willing to acknowledge that they might be wrong, what psychologists call “intellectual humility.” This humble approach extends beyond transparency, the authors write. “Owning our limitations … entails a commitment to foregrounding them, taking them seriously, and accepting their consequences.”</p>



<p>Psychologists have shown that intellectual humility helps people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">learn for the sake of learning</a>, has the potential to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300805">reduce political polarization</a> and encourages people to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550620988242">interrogate news stories for misinformation</a>.</p>



<p>A humble approach could also help restore faith in the social sciences. The field has been in a state of crisis for about a decade as researchers have repeatedly tried and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">failed to replicate original research</a>. That ongoing crisis has prompted soul-searching among many scientists. In 2016, personality psychologist Julia Rohrer launched the <a href="https://lossofconfidencecom.wordpress.com/">Loss-of-Confidence Project</a>, which asked researchers to submit work they no longer believed in, along with a detailed explanation for their changed position. While publicly discrediting one’s own work is retroactive, intellectual humility in science would be proactive — a way for researchers to avoid common pitfalls from the get-go, says Rohrer, of the University of Leipzig in Germany.</p>



<p>Because scientists’ careers often hinge on publishing research papers in top-tier journals, Hoekstra says, they can feel pressure to exaggerate their findings. Scientists might hype the novelty of a study, tinker with statistics to obscure uncertainties in the data, gloss over failed experiments or imply that theoretical results are closer to real-life application than they actually are. Problematically, Hoekstra says, the publication process rewards this behavior. Journal editors and paper reviewers who green-light studies tend to prioritize clear narratives over more nuanced ones.</p>



<p>Change needs to start with those gatekeepers, Hoekstra and Vazire argue. Reviewers especially can contribute to the solution without risking their careers. “Reviewing is one of the few positions in academia where you can freely say whatever you want,” Hoekstra says.</p>



<p>Below Hoekstra explains to <em>Science News</em> how each component of a scientific paper — from the abstract that sets up the work to the discussion that points to conclusions — can be imbued with intellectual humility.</p>



<h4>Title and abstract: </h4>



<p>Setting up the nuances at the top of a study is crucial. For instance, if the study was conducted with a limited pool of participants, researchers should not imply that their findings apply to all people. What’s more researchers should report on all the experiments that are part of the study, not just those that yielded the strongest results.</p>



<h4>Introduction: </h4>



<p>Researchers should refrain from exaggerating how much their findings advance current knowledge. They also shouldn’t cherry-pick among previous studies to make it sound like existing evidence overwhelmingly supports the new findings. Researchers often treat this part of the report as a persuasive argument, Hoekstra says. Instead, researchers should honestly address similar findings, as well as controversies or disagreements around the topic of research.</p>



<h4>Methods: </h4>



<p>The purpose of this section is for an outside researcher to be able to replicate the study by following the instructions, Hoekstra says. “The recipe should be so specific … that you can’t screw it up.” But scientists frequently omit details on timing. That includes basic details, such as what time of day data were gathered, as well as the timing of various decisions. For example, when in the process were certain participants excluded from the study? And what decisions were made before crunching the data versus afterward?</p>



<p>Though it is still an exception rather than a rule, a growing number of journals now require researchers to <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports">preregister their research plan</a> with an online services — spelling out their hypothesis, research design and analyses before beginning their research. That can help protect against bias. “Even if you don’t want to do anything bad, you want to play by the rules, the inclination is to fiddle around with your data to see what works and what doesn’t,” Hoekstra says.</p>



<h4>Results: </h4>



<p>Rather than focus on what the data show, researchers should focus on where the data might fall short. This approach might include conducting multiple analyses to understand how seemingly small decisions in the research design, such as what participants are excluded or how key variables are measured, affect the results.</p>



<p>And researchers should put their statistical findings in context. Outside the social sciences, this process may be relatively straightforward. Epidemiologists, for instance, can quantify how many dying patients a drug may save. But quantifying the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">effect of nostalgia on happiness</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic">how proneness to boredom affects whether people follow social distancing guidelines</a>, can be more challenging.</p>



<p>Researchers can also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/courts-use-statistics-should-be-put-trial">conduct a Bayesian analysis</a>, which incorporates prior knowledge to predict the likelihood of a given outcome.</p>



<h4>Discussion: </h4>



<p>In the final words of a paper, researchers tend to present a more ironclad story than the data allow. Instead, researchers should reiterate potential flaws in the research design and honestly assess how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/culture-helps-shape-when-babies-learn-walk">broadly the results might apply</a>. Many reports, for instance, include a limitations paragraph briefly outlining the study’s potential shortcomings. Instead, those limitations should provide the backbone for the entire discussion.</p>



<p>“We typically sweep uncertainty under the rug in an attempt to be perceived as strong or knowledgeable,” Hoekstra says. “I think it would be much stronger to accept that there’s always uncertainty.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/assassin-bugs-tap-spider-prey-distract-lethal-strike">Assassin bugs tap spiders to distract them before a lethal strike</a></h4>

              
                <p>Assassin bugs live up to their name. The insects expertly stalk and feed upon other small invertebrates, jabbing them with a venomous proboscis. Some species even hunt spiders and use a strange trick to gain the upper hand.</p>



<p>Using their antennae, assassin bugs tap spiders, which <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blab128/6377909?redirectedFrom=fulltext">appears to discombobulate the arachnids long enough to let the bugs make a toxic strike</a>, researchers report September 29 in the <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>. The findings provide insight into some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">sophisticated hunting tactics</a> that predators evolve when targeting dangerous prey (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>Thread-legged bugs are a subfamily of particularly gangly assassin bugs, and some species spend their lives in a place most insects avoid: spider webs. The bugs silently creep along the spider’s silk, taking care to make their vibrations seem benign before violently dispatching the web’s architect, seizing the spiders with their front legs and injecting them with venom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While watching two species of <em>Stenolemus</em> assassin bugs hunt spiders, ecologists Anne Wignall and Fernando Soley took note of the bugs’ habit of lightly knocking their antennae on spiders once the bugs were within striking distance.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“It struck us early on that tapping prey was a really strange thing to do,” says Wignall, of Massey University in Albany, New Zealand. Spiders could easily defend themselves in a lethal fashion. “Watching [the bugs] spend so much time and effort on stealth, only to essentially tap [the spiders] on the shoulder was absolutely fascinating.”</p>



<p>To figure out why the bugs tap, Wignall and Soley, of the Organization for Tropical Studies in&nbsp;San José, Costa Rica, tested the behavior of 30 web-building cellar spiders (<a><em>Pholcus phalangioides</em></a>) in the laboratory. The researchers replicated the bugs’ antennae tapping by gently brushing the spiders’ leg with a dog hair. After the tapping, the team measured the spiders’ responses to a vibrating tuning fork placed on the web, mimicking a struggling insect.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>An assassin bug (<em>Stenolemus giraffe</em>, left) gently taps a spider (<em>Pholcus phalangioides</em>, right) with its long antennae before snatching the spider with its front limbs and delivering a venomous bite.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tapped spiders were far less aggressive than those that weren’t tapped, fully ignoring the fork four times as often. Tapped spiders also attacked the fork about 25 percent as often as their untapped counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wignall thinks that the assassin bugs are reducing spiders’ aggression levels by imitating the types of physical touch that these typically solitary spiders experience near fellow spiders. “Whenever they do come across another spider, it’s usually because it’s a close relative such as a sibling in the nest, or a potential mate. Both of which are situations in which aggression would not be a good idea,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invertebrate zoologist Ondřej Michálek of Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, who was not involved with the study, says that the researchers have a “completely valid hypothesis.” Many spiders avoid cannibalism by using special tactile signals that could be copied by adroit predators, thereby deceiving the arachnids, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, Wignall wants to understand the tapping in greater detail, determining how many taps are sufficient to pacify a spider and the number of spider species that the bugs are manipulating.</p>

It is perfectly fine to also include user oriented information.
We suggest components of both.
We would like &#8220;Dev sessions&#8221; to remain informal where developers do not need to make formal presentations, and they should also remain different from traditional&nbsp;tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="citing-research-software">
<h3>Citing research&nbsp;software</h3>
<p>A large proportion of the meeting was dedicated to discussion around how we can ensure that software is correctly cited in research work to ensure that their authors get credit for their work.
This is especially important in the current scientific climate where publications and citations are used as proxies to gauge&nbsp;performance.</p>
<p>Some ideas that were discussed&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>using the right&nbsp;license</li>
<li>lists of good Free/Open Source licenses:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing#Good_Licenses">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing#Good_Licenses</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/">https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a good website providing quick license summaries is: <a class="reference external" href="https://tldrlegal.com">https://tldrlegal.com</a></li>
<li>publishing articles on Free/Open source software in focussed journals, for e.g.: <a class="reference external" href="https://joss.theoj.org/">https://joss.theoj.org/</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/">https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/</a></li>
<li>ensuring that tools get enough visibility, for example by making sure they are listed on websites dedicated to collecting Open Source tools for neuroscience, e.g.: <a class="reference external" href="https://open-neuroscience.com/">https://open-neuroscience.com/</a></li>
<li>also increasing visibility of research software using appropriate channels, e.g.: World Wide Neuro series for software: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.world-wide.org/Neuro/">https://www.world-wide.org/Neuro/</a></li>
<li>adding appropriate citation files to software projects, e.g. on GitHub: <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files</a></li>
<li>adding RRIDs for research software and using them in publications: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rrids.org/">https://www.rrids.org/</a> .
Some journals make it mandatory to cite software using RRIDs and then automatically link to the tool.<ul>
<li>eLife encourages it: <a class="reference external" href="https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies">https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies</a><ul>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>To help promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of key research resources, we encourage you to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) within the Materials and Methods section to identify the model organisms, cells lines, antibodies, and tools (such as <strong>software</strong> or databases) you have&nbsp;used.&#8221;</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-drug-hospital-death">The antidepressant fluvoxamine can keep COVID-19 patients out of the hospital</a></h4>

              
                <p>An inexpensive, easy-to-take pill could be the next weapon in the arsenal against COVID-19. Taking the antidepressant fluvoxamine within days of showing symptoms of an infection can dramatically cut the risk of hospitalization and death, suggests the largest trial to date of this FDA-approved generic drug as a COVID-19 treatment.</p>



<p>In newly infected COVID-19 patients at high risk of complications, a 10-day course of the antidepressant fluvoxamine <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00448-4/fulltext">cut hospitalizations by two-thirds and reduced deaths by 91 percent</a> in patients who tolerated the medicine, researchers report October 27 in the <em>Lancet Global Health</em>.</p>

<p>Fluvoxamine is commonly prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disorder and acts by increasing levels of the brain chemical serotonin between nerve cells. Aside from those effects, the drug has other biological properties that could quell inflammation triggered by COVID-19, says child psychiatrist Angela Reiersen of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. She &nbsp;<a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/329200553/8/">stumbled onto the idea</a> to test fluvoxamine as a COVID-19 treatment while scouring papers during her own bout of illness early in the pandemic.</p>





<p>“This is an existing medicine with two to three decades of clinical use — something millions of people have taken,” says David Boulware, an infectious disease physician and researcher at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. “It’s available at every pharmacy in the U.S., and [a 10-day course] costs $10.” By comparison, a five-day course of Merck’s antiviral <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">molnupiravir</a> — another oral drug that can protect people from serious COVID-19 — carries a $700 price tag (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boulware was not involved in the latest trial but helped analyze results from a smaller study showing fluvoxamine’s promise as an early COVID-19 treatment. That study tested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-treatment">real-world use</a> of the antidepressant in workers who got infected during a COVID-19 outbreak at a California horse racing track last November (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>The new analysis was conducted as part of <a href="https://www.togethertrial.com/">TOGETHER</a> — an international collaboration launched last year to test multiple repurposed medications in placebo-controlled experiments at the same time. The study’s adaptive design allows investigators to remove treatments from the study when statistical analyses show the drugs offer no benefit, as has been the case for the antimalarial drug <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">hydroxychloroquine</a> and for ivermectin, a drug commonly used against parasites (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>).</p>

<p>For the new study, researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, partnered with the research clinic Cardresearch in Brazil to recruit 1,497 unvaccinated, high-risk adults in their first week of flu-like symptoms from COVID-19. Patients at 11 clinical sites in Brazil entered the trial between January and August, and received either 100 milligrams of fluvoxamine or placebo pills twice a day for 10 days.&nbsp;Investigators monitored participants for another 28 days after treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the placebo group, 119 of 756 patients, or 15.7 percent, developed complications requiring hospitalization or more than six hours of emergency care. In comparison, 79 of 741, or 10.7 percent, of fluvoxamine-treated patients got that sick. Taking fluvoxamine cut emergency visits and hospitalization by 32 percent, the trial found.</p>



<p>Among patients who took at least 80 percent of their doses, the benefits were even stronger. About three-fourths of patients fell into that group, with the most common reason for stopping the drug being gastrointestinal complaints. Fluvoxamine cut serious complications in that group by 66 percent and reduced mortality by 91 percent. In the placebo group, 12 patients died, compared with one who received the drug. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the latest data and fluvoxamine’s long-standing safety record, Reiersen says, “we believe it should be used in COVID-19 for patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality from complications of the infection.” According to Boulware, the expert panel that develops U.S. COVID-19 treatment guidelines was briefed on the data in mid-September and could decide soon about recommending fluvoxamine as an early treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sterile-neutrino-particle-physics-mystery-microboone">Doubt cast on theorized ‘sterile’ particles leaves a neutrino mystery unsolved</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, physicists have suspected an interloper. A reclusive, hypothetical subatomic particle might be creeping into studies of neutrinos, nearly massless particles with no electric charge. A new study casts doubt on that idea, but leaves unsolved the mystery of what caused peculiar results in certain neutrino experiments.</p>



<p>“We still don’t have the answer,” says physicist Kate Scholberg of Duke University, who was not involved with the new result. “It’s simultaneously satisfying and unsatisfying.”</p>



<p>Neutrinos, which come in three known varieties, have shown up in greater numbers than expected in some experiments. That strange behavior raised the tantalizing prospect that a stealthier fourth type of neutrino, called a sterile neutrino, might be awaiting discovery. But new data from the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment, or MicroBooNE, favor the canonical neutrino trio.</p>



<p>An earlier experiment called MiniBooNE, located at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., had for years found more neutrinos than expected at low energies, a hint <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-neutrino-surplus-hints-existence-new-particles">strengthened with more data</a> in 2018 (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>). An even earlier neutrino experiment, performed in the 1990s, had also seen a similar signal.</p>





<p>With MiniBooNE, scientists studied a phenomenon called neutrino oscillation. The three known varieties of neutrinos — electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos — can transform, or oscillate, from one type to another as they travel. MiniBooNE looked for electron neutrinos produced when muon neutrinos oscillated.The apparent glut of electron neutrinos seen by MiniBooNE could indicate that the switch seemed to happen more often than expected, potentially due to sterile neutrinos muddling up the oscillations.</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Particle detectors can’t directly spot neutrinos, instead identifying them by observing other particles spit out when neutrinos interact within a detector. And MiniBooNE tended to confuse electrons — a signature of electron neutrinos — with photons, particles of light that could indicate another particle. That left scientists unsure whether the excess events were really electron neutrinos. The sterile neutrino remained a question mark.</p>



<p>Enter MicroBooNE. Also at Fermilab, the experiment uses an advanced type of detector that can tell electrons from photons. So scientists set out to investigate the excess events — aiming to find out whether they involved electrons or photons. But MicroBooNE, confusingly, found no excess at all. In an <a href="https://theory.fnal.gov/events/event/search-for-anomalous-single-photon-production-in-microboone-as-a-first-test-of-the-miniboone-low-energy-excess/">October 1 seminar</a> and a paper posted at arXiv.org, MicroBooNE had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00409">mostly eliminated</a> the possibility of extra events involving photons. The new result, reported October 27 during a virtual seminar, rules out <a href="https://microboone.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/paper_electron_analysis_2021.pdf">many of the possible types of extra events involving electrons</a>, making the sterile neutrino idea less plausible.</p>



<p>It’s not clear why one experiment saw an excess while the other didn’t. The difference between the two measurements might come down to the different materials used in the detectors, Scholberg says — carbon in the case of MiniBooNE, argon for MicroBooNE.</p>



<p>Other possible explanations for the excess events that MiniBooNE found remain to be investigated, some of which might go beyond standard physics. The detections, for example, might involve electrons paired with their antimatter partners, positrons. That pair could point the finger at different hypothetical subatomic stuff, in particular, what’s called an axionlike particle.</p>



<p>The researchers “have eliminated a lot of possibilities of what this excess could be, so I found the results pretty compelling,” says physicist Mayly Sanchez of Iowa State University in Ames, who was not involved with the study. “You’re giving fewer and fewer places to hide to these sterile neutrinos.”</p>



<p>But all hope for sterile neutrinos is not lost: A more complicated scenario involving a sterile neutrino combined with other theorized new phenomena could still explain the excess events.</p>



<p>“There’s still a mystery afoot,” says physicist Bonnie Fleming of Yale University, a cospokesperson of the MicroBooNE experiment. “We have more work to do. There’s no doubt about that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolf-falkland-islands-origin-ancient-human-visitors-fire-hunt">Ancient human visitors complicate the Falkland Islands wolf’s origin story</a></h4>

              
                <p>The enigmatic, now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf had human visitors on the remote archipelago up to 1,070 years ago. The find suggests that Indigenous people could have originally brought the foxlike creatures, also known as the warrah, to the islands.</p>



<p>Scientists have debated how the islands’ only land mammal journeyed to the region: by a long-ago land bridge or with people. But little evidence of a human presence before Europeans arrived in 1690 had been found. Now, traces of ancient fires and hunting <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh3803">show that Indigenous people arrived on the Falkland Islands centuries prior to Europeans</a>, researchers report October 27 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The Yaghan people — historically fire-wielding seafarers who kept foxes as companions — may have been the visitors.</p>



<p>Abrupt spikes in charcoal levels in sediments offer “telltale signs of human arrival” from 1,070 to 620 years ago on New Island, says Kit Hamley, a paleoecologist and archaeologist at the University of Maine in Orono. Those spikes mirror later traces of Europeans’ fires around 250 years ago.</p>



<p>And massive piles of sea lion and penguin bones imply hunting by humans from 745 to 600 years ago, Hamley says. Before being hunted to extinction by Europeans in 1875, the Falkland Islands wolf (<em>Dusicyon australis</em>) also consumed marine predators such as sea lions and penguins, nitrogen levels in two warrah bones and one tooth show. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-600x450.jpg" alt="skull and teeth from a now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf" class="wp-image-3105227" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1-560x420.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_jc_wolf_inline1.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105227">A tooth and bones from a now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf (skull shown) revealed clues about the animal’s diet. Nitrogen levels show that the foxlike creature consumed seals and penguins.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105227">K. Hamley</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers newly dated that tooth and found it to be from 3,860 years ago. That vastly predates the fire-and-bone-pile evidence, leaving a gap “between when the warrah arrives, and when we can definitively say people were there,” Hamley says.</p>



<p>But Indigenous people’s presence up to 1,070 years ago raises new questions about whether the warrah hitchhiked there with earlier human visitors, Hamley says. </p>



<p>Next, Hamley and colleagues plan to partner with the few remaining Yaghan communities in Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to piece together “parts of the story that have been lost or taken away.”</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The emergency hospital, a partially demolished building hastily enclosed with wooden partitions, was about to open. It was the fall of 1918 in Philadelphia, and influenza was spreading fast. With many of the city’s doctors and nurses serving in World War I, 23-year-old Isaac Starr and his third-year classmates at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine needed to help tend the sick. They’d had just one lecture on influenza. Their first job was to assemble the hospital beds, about 25 to a floor.</p>



<p>Starr’s shift was 4 p.m. to midnight. The beds soon filled with <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-145-2-200607180-00132">patients who had fevers</a>, he recalled in a 1976 essay for <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Many who developed influenza recovered. But Starr witnessed some patients become starved for air, their skin turning blue. Soon, they were “struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth,” he wrote. “It was a dreadful business.”</p>

<p>There were no effective treatments. Patients, desperate for breath, became delirious and incontinent and would die within days. “When I returned to duty at 4 p.m., I found few whom I had seen before,” Starr wrote. “This happened night after night.” In October, around the pinnacle of the pandemic, roughly 11,000 Philadelphians perished.</p>



<p>Some who died in the makeshift hospital stuck with Starr. There was Mike the piano mover, who in a frenzy left his bed and was about to leap from a window before medical staff grabbed him. Mike died shortly after. There was the young woman, “flushed with fever,” whose large family kept vigil at her bedside, hoping for a recovery that never came.</p>



<p>An estimated 50 million people worldwide died of influenza during the 1918 pandemic. The century since has seen many vaccines and treatments become available to combat infectious diseases. But beyond those medical feats, the story of epidemics remains a story about people: people who become sick, people who die, people whose lives are upended, people who care for others. And ultimately, people who remember what happened and people who forget.</p>



<p>The public memory of the 1918 pandemic, which lasted into 1919, faded quickly in the United States, with few historical accounts or memorials to victims in the aftermath. One of the first major histories of the pandemic, by Alfred Crosby, didn’t arrive until 1976, the same year Starr published his reflections on serving in an influenza ward. Crosby’s book was eventually reissued with the fitting title <em>America’s Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918</em>.</p>

<p>Since 1918, we have faced many epidemics, but COVID-19 has been the first to rival the great flu in how it has changed everyone’s daily lives. “We are living through a historic pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>But a hundred years’ worth of advances in virology, medical understanding and vaccine development has made a difference. It was 11 months from the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to “having a vaccine that you could put in people’s arms,” Fauci says, “a beautiful testimony to the importance of investing in biomedical research.”</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is also a stark reminder of what hasn’t changed. “Pandemics just surface all the muck,” says internist, medical humanities scholar and historian of medicine Lakshmi Krishnan of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Ever present but often ignored societal inequities become unavoidable. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">disproportionate weight of COVID-19 disease and death on Black, Latino and Native American communities in the United States</a> — “we better not forget,” says Fauci. “We really need to address the social determinants of health that lead to these very, very obvious disparities.”</p>



<p>Yet outbreak after outbreak, our collective memory falters. The urgency of the predicament eventually fades. The families mourning the loss of loved ones, people struggling with unmet medical needs, with stigma, become small islands of remembrance ever threatened by vast seas of forgetfulness and indifference.</p>



<p>Sometimes forgetfulness comes from a lack of reckoning. The United States moved on from the 1918 pandemic without addressing what was lost. Sometimes the success of vaccines obscures their power. The fear that surrounded polio subsided in the United States after the country rolled up its sleeves for polio vaccines. The dread of many other childhood illnesses, such as diphtheria and measles, has also diminished, leaving some to take prevention measures for granted.</p>



<p>To look back at infectious diseases since 1918 is to observe what we’ve learned about the viruses, bacteria and fungi with which we share our world, and observe the strides made in lessening their harms. But it’s also a call to listen to the stories of how infectious diseases have shaped people’s lives.</p>



<p>Outbreaks “have occurred throughout history and they occur now,” Fauci says. “And they will continue to occur.”</p>





<h3>Vaccine victories</h3>



<p>On February 24, 1947, Eugene Le Bar, an American merchant, boarded a bus in Mexico City. During the trip, his head began to ache and he broke out with a rash. He arrived in New York City on March 1 still not feeling well. Four days later, he was admitted to the hospital. His stay overlapped with a mumps patient named Ismael Acosta and a little girl, almost 2, who had croup.</p>



<p>Le Bar deteriorated while doctors searched for a diagnosis. He died March 10. Acosta and the little girl had been discharged, but returned later in March with rashes. The results of tests for those two led to a review of Le Bar’s autopsy. The diagnosis was smallpox, a disease that kills about 30 percent of those sickened and leaves survivors disfigured by prominent scars.</p>



<p>More victims turned up. A little boy with whooping cough who had been at the hospital developed a rash. So did Acosta’s 26-year-old wife, Carmen, who died days later. Soon the number of people with smallpox reached 12. New York City embarked on a massive vaccination campaign.</p>



<p>At the time, Anthony Fauci was 6 years old, growing up in Brooklyn. He remembers his parents talking about a huge event that would be happening in the city. “We all had to get vaccinated, and vaccination means somebody would get a little needle and prick it multiple times in your arm.” (The smallpox vaccine wasn’t given as a shot; instead, a drop of vaccine was placed on the skin and a needle poked the skin repeatedly to usher the vaccine into the body.) Fauci and his family were among the millions of New Yorkers immunized that spring, bringing the smallpox outbreak to a close without another person added to the count.</p>

<p>Throughout history, smallpox was one of the most feared infectious diseases. A British historian, writing about the 1694 death of Queen Mary II from smallpox at age 32, described the disease as “always present, filling the churchyards with corpses, tormenting with constant fears all whom it had not yet stricken, leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous traces of its power.”</p>



<p>Smallpox is also a starring character in the story of vaccines. At the end of the 18th century, the English physician Edward Jenner extracted fluid from a sore caused by cowpox on a dairymaid’s hand and inoculated a young boy with it, a test of the belief among some farmers that getting sick with cowpox protected against smallpox. The experiment propelled forward the concept of vaccination. By giving the immune system a preview of the pathogen, the body’s defenses were prepared for the main event.</p>



<p>What followed exemplifies the fullest power of vaccination. After a worldwide campaign, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/no-more-smallpox">smallpox was the first infectious disease to be declared eradicated from the globe</a>, in 1980 (<em>SN: 11/03/79, p. 310</em>). A scourge that had plagued humankind for at least 3,000 years was consigned to the history books.</p>



<p>Other vaccine-preventable diseases — especially those that afflict children — harm many fewer around the world today than in the near past. During the 20th century in the United States, after vaccines became widely used for nine diseases, including polio, measles and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, cases declined by 95 to 100 percent. Yet there can be “a lack of appreciation for what vaccines have done in terms of getting rid of or managing many infectious diseases,” says virologist A. Oveta Fuller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>



<p>For many people today, an understanding of polio only <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/polio-research-brings-hope">comes from history books</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/51, p. 42</em>). But others who grew up when summers meant polio outbreaks have sharp recollections.</p>



<p>Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was 5 years old in 1956. After surgery on his foot, he stayed for about six weeks in a Baltimore hospital’s chronic care facility. It was primarily a polio ward. He was surrounded by children whose limbs were suspended in traction or whose bodies were swallowed in iron lungs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="642" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung.jpg" alt="black and white photo of children inside an iron lung" class="wp-image-3105108" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-614x383.jpg 614w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-722x450.jpg 722w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-298x186.jpg 298w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-768x479.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_diseases_iironlung-931x580.jpg 931w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105108">If polio impaired the muscles in the chest, patients would be placed in an iron lung, which forced air in and out of their lungs so they could breathe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105108">FOOD COLLECTION/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was a lonely, frightening experience,” Offit says. Parents were allowed to visit only one hour a week. He could see “how vulnerable and helpless and alone all of those children were.” Offit’s bed was next to a window, which gave him a view of the building’s front door. He’d stare at the entrance, “waiting for someone to come save me.”</p>



<p>Offit later trained at that same hospital as a medical student. The ward he had languished in as a child was now a suite of offices. The room looked the same, even the molding, “and that window was still there,” Offit says. “I remember walking up and looking out that window and seeing the same thing I saw 20 years earlier and just fighting back tears.”</p>



<p>Memorial Day weekend in the United States used to herald a season of polio fear, as cases rose in summertime. Children were barred from swimming pools and crowds. Fauci’s parents wouldn’t allow him and his sister to go to the beach at Coney Island. “All of us as kids knew somebody who’d been paralyzed,” says David Morens, Fauci’s senior scientific adviser, who grew up in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Vaccines provided an exit from this recurring nightmare. The two vaccines developed to thwart polio each drew on different advances. First came Jonas Salk’s “killed” polio vaccine, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/steps-polio-conquest">approved in 1955</a> (<em>SN: 4/16/55, p. 242</em>). Made with poliovirus that had been treated with formaldehyde, the virus could no longer cause harm, but the body could still mount an immune response against it. About seven decades earlier, Louis Pasteur had demonstrated that rabies virus could be inactivated to develop a rabies vaccine.</p>



<p>The second vaccine, Albert Sabin’s oral polio vaccine, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/oral-polio-vaccine-safe">became available in 1961</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/63, p. 370</em>). Often delivered on a sugar cube, Sabin’s easily digested vaccine was the inspiration for the song “A Spoonful of Sugar” in the movie <em>Mary Poppins</em>. Sabin’s approach was to weaken the poliovirus by making it replicate in nonhuman cells. Forced into an unfamiliar environment, the virus made genetic changes that diminished its ability to cause disease. This method, called attenuation, had first been used about 25 years earlier to create a yellow fever vaccine.</p>

<h3>Vanishing ailments</h3>



<p>Life before and after polio vaccines was like night and day. In 1952, polio paralyzed more than 21,000 people in the United States. Thirteen years later, that number had plummeted to 61. By 1979, polio was eliminated in the country. With new immunizations, one by one, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccine-vindication#slideshow">common childhood ailments all but vanished</a> in the United States: measles, rubella, chicken pox, and meningitis caused by bacteria.</p>



<p>When Kathryn Edwards trained in pediatrics in Chicago in the mid- to late 1970s, “we were really in the grips of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> meningitis.” (<em>H. influenzae</em>, formerly <em>Bacillus influenzae</em>, is the misnamed bacterium that had once been suspected of causing influenza.) She remembers seeing four or five children at a time hospitalized with this dangerous swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, says Edwards, an infectious disease pediatrician and vaccine researcher at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Some children with <em>H. influenzae</em> meningitis were left with brain damage, while about 5 percent died. Edwards still remembers a young patient lost to the disease the last night of her training.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/biomedicine-46">first vaccine against <em>H. influenzae</em> type b</a>, the type that most commonly caused meningitis and other severe infections, became available in the United States in 1985. More effective vaccines came a few years later, evaluated by Edwards and colleagues. Again the impact was unmistakable. Before 1985, close to 20,000 children, most of them under age 5, developed severe infections from <em>H. influenzae</em> type b each year, including 12,000 with bacterial meningitis. By 1994 and 1995, the incidence of severe disease had fallen 98 percent in children age 4 or younger. With the availability of vaccines against <em>H. influenzae</em> and other pathogens, “the practice of pediatrics is much different now than when I began 40 years ago,” Edwards says.</p>



<p>The scope of infectious diseases that children face worldwide is slowly changing too. From 2000 to 2018, 23 million deaths globally were prevented by measles vaccination. But there are still millions of children around the world missing out on basic immunizations that are routine in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the problem: An estimated 23 million children worldwide did not receive childhood vaccines in 2020; that’s about 3.7 million more than in 2019.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Big impact</h3>



<p>Vaccines that came into wide use in the 20th century against diphtheria, polio, measles and other diseases drastically reduced or, in the case of polio, eliminated the illnesses by the end of the century in the United States. Smallpox was globally eradicated by 1980.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed">work of developing vaccines</a> against COVID-19 began shortly after researchers worked out the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in January 2020. Previous studies of the coronaviruses behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/morbid-mystery-tour-epidemic-china-encircling-globe">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</a>, or SARS (<em>SN: 3/29/03, p. 198</em>), and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mers-outbreak-picks-pace-middle-east">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</a>, or MERS (<em>SN: 5/31/14, p. 6</em>), had identified a viral protein that would effectively ramp up an immune response.</p>



<p>And the basic research that would underpin a new vaccine technology, which would be used for two of the first COVID-19 vaccines, had been going on for decades. The approach is based on messenger RNA, or mRNA, which carries out of the cell nucleus the instructions for making a protein. The vaccines have the guide for the viral protein; the body makes that protein and produces antibodies against it. Some of the crucial work, modifying the instructions for the viral protein so the body wouldn’t see the guide as an invader, came from RNA biologist Katalin Karikó, immunologist Drew Weissman and colleagues working at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in the mid- to late 2000s.</p>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines were created and tested in the shortest timeline for any vaccines yet. But that efficiency wasn’t matched in the distribution. While <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">there haven’t been enough shots available globally</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 6</em>), the United States, a country awash in supply, has struggled to immunize everyone eligible. Some people haven’t been vaccinated because they can’t take time off work to recover from side effects or are worried they’ll have to pay for the shots. Others don’t see COVID-19 as a threat and don’t see the need for the vaccine.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has killed millions of people worldwide. Yet perhaps it would be more terrifying if it primarily threatened children. The horror of polio was that it could leave children paralyzed for the rest of their lives, Offit says; it was as though children had been injured in war.</p>



<p>Michigan’s Fuller thinks that seeing the harm that polio could do to children helped make Americans eager for polio vaccines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, “because we were all isolated, we didn’t see each other really suffering or dealing with the effects of this virus,” she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>One person vaccinated feels like such a victory.</p><cite>Katherine Spindler</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>When virologist Katherine Spindler of the University of Michigan was growing up, she had measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccines for those afflictions “came along too late for me,” Spindler says. She still remembers the name of her older brother’s classmate who died in eighth grade of an infectious disease. The routine immunizations that are now regular parts of pediatrician appointments mean that most of us “don’t know what it’s like to have polio or to die from measles.”</p>



<p>Spindler found getting the COVID-19 vaccine “so meaningful,” thinking about all of the science that came together to develop it. People have e-mailed her with questions about the vaccine. One woman who had an appointment but wasn’t sure she wanted to keep it wrote several times. Spindler spent a few hours responding. Finally, she got an e-mail back with a picture of the woman in her car getting the shot. “Tears came to my eyes,” Spindler says. “One person vaccinated feels like such a victory.”</p>



<h3>The aftermath</h3>



<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lakshmi Krishnan and S. Michelle Ogunwole were internists at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Patients were dying. There wasn’t enough personal protective equipment for staff. So much about COVID-19 was still unknown. “It was terrifying,” says Krishnan, now at Georgetown University. Some of her colleagues were writing their wills.</p>



<p>And the patients were largely alone. Ogunwole, also a health disparities researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, remembers an older Black woman who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for months. She was well enough to move out of the intensive care unit but was extremely debilitated because she hadn’t walked in so long, Ogunwole says. A tube in her windpipe made talking difficult as well.</p>



<p>The woman’s family was not there. “There was nobody to speak for her,” Ogunwole says. It made Ogunwole think of her own mother, “an incredibly vibrant person … the life of the party.” If it was her mom in that bed, no one would have known who she is. That she likes to dance for no reason. That she picks up a different sport every year.</p>

<p>Ogunwole felt her patient’s sorrow and loss. Millions are reckoning with the pandemic’s cost to their physical and mental health. The toll is not unlike that of tuberculosis, AIDS, fungal diseases, childhood infectious diseases or the many other outbreaks and epidemics of the last century.</p>



<p>We should know by heart how lives — and whose lives — are changed by infectious disease outbreaks. But time and again, there’s a clamor to leave outbreaks behind us. And the trauma and the inequities linger. The question this time, says historian Nancy Bristow of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., is, “Can we do a better job of continuing to hear the stories of those who have been affected?”</p>



<p>The stories of children who have lost one parent or both, for example. For her book <em>American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic</em>, Bristow interviewed Lillian Kancianich, born in a small town in North Dakota. Kancianich’s mother died of influenza when Kancianich was a baby. The story was that her mother was out sweeping the porch on Armistice Day and then was never seen again, Bristow says.</p>



<p>Kancianich bounced among extended family members’ houses for two years before she was able to call one home. She told Bristow that as a child, when asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, her answer was, a stepmother. “The loss of that parent changed her life completely,” Bristow says.</p>



<p>These stories have continued. In roughly the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext#%20">1 million children worldwide experienced the death of a mother, a father or both</a>, researchers reported in July in the <em>Lancet</em>. The number is staggering, and yet it is a fraction of the estimated 17 million children who have lost one or both parents to AIDS in roughly the last three decades, according to the United States Agency for International Development. Ninety percent of those children live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Outbreak after outbreak, our collective memory falters. The urgency of the predicament eventually fades.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nearly 105,000 children in the United States are facing life without one or both parents due to COVID-19, the study in the <em>Lancet</em> found. “Evidence from previous epidemics shows that ineffective responses to the death of a parent or caregiver, even when there is a surviving parent or caregiver, can lead to deleterious psychosocial, neurocognitive, socioeconomic and biomedical outcomes for children,” the authors wrote.</p>



<p>An earlier study on parental death due to COVID-19 in the United States took race and ethnicity into account. While Black children make up only 14 percent of children in the United States, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2778229">they made up 20 percent of those who had lost a parent</a>, researchers reported in April in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>When Krishnan was treating patients early in the pandemic, she remembers noting, “It’s all my Black and brown patients that are getting upgraded to the intensive care unit.” Research has revealed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">a disproportionate impact among Black, Latino and Native Americans</a> in terms of infection, hospitalization and death.</p>



<p>“COVID has unveiled disparities in health,” but the pandemic didn’t create them, Fuller says. “This is not new.”</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, Black Americans’ death rates were higher than white Americans for tuberculosis, pneumonia and, in children, diarrheal disease and diseases of malnutrition, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in 1906, “an indication of social and economic position.” Racism and segregation restricted access to health care, housing and wealth for Black Americans.</p>



<p>The accounts from 1918 in Black newspapers in Philadelphia and Chicago “gave the impression that the epidemic did not substantially disrupt life in black communities,” <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00333549101250S314">wrote</a> Vanessa Northington Gamble in <em>Public Health Reports</em> in 2010. Yet it was clear that the number of Black people who did have flu “overwhelmed the medical care facilities that were available to them,” says Northington Gamble, a physician and medical historian at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. White hospitals wouldn’t accept Black patients or would send them to the basement or other segregated areas. Black hospitals didn’t have the capacity for everyone who needed care. So Black communities came together to provide for their own, she says.</p>

<p>When every one of the 75 beds at Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital in Philadelphia filled up, its medical director, with no support from the city’s board of health, managed to open an emergency annex for Black patients. Black women volunteers in Chicago made house visits to tend to the sick.</p>



<p>Black nurses also cared for Black influenza patients in their homes. Bessie B. Hawes, a 1918 graduate of the Tuskegee Institute’s nursing program, described her experience caring for a family of 10, “dying for the want of attention,” in a rural area of Alabama. “As I entered the little country cabin, I found the mother dead in bed, the father and the remainder of the family running temperatures of 102 to 104˚. Some had influenza and others had pneumonia…. I saw at a glance that I had much work to do…. I milked the cow, gave medicine, and did everything I could to help conditions.”</p>



<p>One of the legacies of the 1918 pandemic is “this long-standing tradition of the Black community of standing up and taking care of itself,” says Northington Gamble. The tradition continues, she says, with the work of organizations including the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, created to make it easier for Black communities in the Philadelphia area to receive COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</p>



<p>When Black people became ill with influenza in the 1918 pandemic, they were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678782/">more likely to die than white people with influenza</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>. That <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-2223">higher likelihood of death</a> “could be attributed to several factors still present today: higher risk for pulmonary disease, malnutrition, poor housing conditions, social and economic disparities, and inadequate access to care,” Krishnan, Ogunwole and their colleague Lisa Cooper of Johns Hopkins University wrote last year in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The societal systems that foster racial discrimination and lead to health inequities must be addressed, Ogunwole says. “There is no amount of resilience that overcomes that.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>We cannot forget because it will happen again.</p><cite>Lakshmi Krishnan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The suffering of the 1918 pandemic was overshadowed by the end of World War I, Bristow says. The war was publicly memorialized with monuments and a holiday. “The pandemic goes unspoken,” she says, because it doesn’t fit with the victorious narrative of the war. Only a few fictional works that drew upon the 1918 pandemic were published in the following decades.</p>



<p>But those books — such as the 1939 <em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</em>, by Katherine Anne Porter, who survived an influenza illness but whose fiancé died — as well as private letters reveal deep loss, Bristow says.</p>



<p>“It’s very clear that the trauma stayed with people, even if there’s not public grieving, and that’s what’s so sad about it,” she says. “There was no public acknowledgment of all of this loss.” The country marched ahead, and people “were expected to hop in line and march along too.”</p>



<p>Krishnan, a historian of medicine, says we must preserve a record of the COVID-19 pandemic. A hopeful sign that stories of how people felt, lived, loved and died won’t be lost are the <a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/oralhistory/page/about">many oral history projects</a> spearheaded by <a href="https://incite.columbia.edu/covid19-oral-history-project">universities</a> and <a href="https://www.nypl.org/pandemic-diaries">libraries</a>. “We cannot forget,” Krishnan says, “because it will happen again.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-asian-mummies-bronze-age-ancestry-mystery">DNA from mysterious Asian mummies reveals their surprising ancestry</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mystery mummies from Central Asia have a surprising ancestry. These people, who displayed facial characteristics suggesting a European heritage, belonged to a local population with ancient Asian roots, a new study finds. Until now, researchers had pegged the mummified Bronze Age bunch as newcomers and debated about where in West Asia they originally came from.</p>



<p>Desert heat naturally mummified hundreds of bodies buried in western China’s Tarim Basin from roughly 4,000 to 1,800 years ago. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/indo-european-pursuits">Preserved remains of these people have been excavated since the 1990s</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/95</em>). Those interred around 4,000 years ago belonged to the Xiaohe culture, a population that mixed animal herding with plant cultivation. Their boat-shaped coffins were unlike any others in the region. And preserved cheese, wheat, millet and clothes made from western Eurasian wool found in Xiaohe graves pointed to distant contacts or origins.</p>



<p>Archaeogeneticist Yinqiu Cui of Jilin University in Changchun, China, and an international team analyzed DNA from 13 Tarim Basin mummies from roughly 4,100 to 3,700 years ago and five other human mummies from the nearby Dzungarian Basin from around 5,000 to 4,800 years ago.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="528" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1.jpg" alt="a cemetery in the desert with spiky protrusions pointing out from the sand in China's Tarim Basin" class="wp-image-3105210" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-493x383.jpg 493w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-580x450.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621_bb_mummy_inline1-240x186.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105210">Researchers collected DNA from mummified bodies at this Bronze Age cemetery in western China.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105210">Wenying Li/Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarim people <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04052-7">displayed Asian ancestry</a> mainly traceable to hunter-gatherers who inhabited much of northern Eurasia more than 9,000 years ago. That finding suggests that the mummies belonged to a population that did not mate with outsiders for many millennia, the researchers report October 27 in <em>Nature</em>. No DNA links were found to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">western Eurasian herders from the Afanasievo culture</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>), who some researchers have regarded as precursors of Xiaohe people.</p>



<p>A predominantly Afanasievo ancestry did appear in the Dzungarian individuals. Milk proteins found in dental tartar from seven Tarim mummies indicated that those people regularly consumed dairy products, a practice possibly learned from Afanasievo descendants in the Dzungarian Basin, the researchers say.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/qBK42xSNwoM/">PLOS Announces New Publishing Agreements with CRL and NERL</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Note: PLOS issued the following press release on Wednesday, October 27</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;In concert with Open Access Week, the Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce an agreement with<a href="http://nerl.org/"> NorthEast Research Libraries</a> (NERL) and the <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a> (CRL) to participate in PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models. This three-year agreement provides researchers from NERL and CRL affiliated institutions with unlimited publishing privileges in PLOS journals without incurring fees. NERL and CRL combined have more than 200 Members.</p>



<p>&ldquo;CRL and NERL are thrilled to partner with PLOS to find innovative models between research libraries and nonprofit publishers to make scholarly publishing and research open and equitable for the benefit of all,&rdquo; said Thomas Padilla,&nbsp;Senior Director of Collections, Technology, and Partnerships at CRL.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by existing &ndash; and new &ndash; institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn3"><u>[3]</u></a>. PLOS will waive the annual fee if a member institution is in a <a href="http://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/">Research4Life country</a>.</p>



<p><a>&ldquo;The NERL/CRL agreement represents a new model for libraries to collaborate and invest equitably in our common interests in advancing Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;They share our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am particularly excited by this collaborative, unlimited publishing agreement. As strong advocates for open access to scientific research since their inception twenty years ago, PLOS is an ideal partner in our ongoing efforts to transform scholarly publishing,&rdquo; said Lynda Hartel, Assistant Vice President, Health Sciences and Director of The Ohio State University Health Sciences Library. &ldquo;This agreement will help to alleviate barriers such as article processing charges (APCs) and expand opportunities for all Ohio State faculty, staff, and students &mdash; not just those with research grants or departmental funding &mdash; to publish in the expansive collection of PLOS journals. This partnership will play a key role in increasing the impact and reach of our researchers, and will give those of us in the participating libraries an opportunity to assess and learn from this venture.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This agreement is in alignment with our strategy for leveraging the Libraries&rsquo; investments in support of open scholarship, to share the brilliance of our University community with the world,&rdquo; says Sarah Hutton, Interim Dean of Libraries, <a href="https://www.library.umass.edu/news/umass-amherst-libraries-signs-agreement-with-plos-to-cover-open-access-publication-fees/">UMass Amherst</a>. &ldquo;This brings us closer to a shared vision for open knowledge creation and dissemination in the global community.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our faculty at the University of Arkansas are already eager to take advantage of our participation in this new agreement. By eliminating APC costs, open access publishing in PLOS journals becomes approachable for a large swath of our researchers and in so doing makes the knowledge generated by these publications equitably accessible to our campus and beyond,&rdquo; said Jason Battles, Dean of Libraries, University of Arkansas.</p>



<p>CRL and NERL join a growing list of institutions including the Big Ten Academic Alliance, the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Participating journals include PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine and PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-earth-warming-emissions-gap-pledges">Earth will warm 2.7 degrees Celsius based on current pledges to cut emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year was supposed to be a turning point in addressing climate change. But the world’s nations <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021">are failing to meet the moment</a>, states a new report by the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>



<p>The <em>Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On</em>, released October 26, reveals that current pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and rein in global warming still put the world on track to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century.</p>



<p>Aiming for “net-zero emissions” by midcentury — a goal recently announced by China, the United States and other countries, but without clear plans on how to do so — could reduce that warming to 2.2 degrees C. But that still falls short of the mark, U.N. officials stated at a news event for the report’s release.</p>



<p>At a landmark meeting in Paris in 2015, 195 nations pledged to eventually reduce their emissions enough to hold global warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">to well below 2 degrees C</a> by 2100 (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). Restricting global warming further, to just 1.5 degrees C, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">forestall many more devastating consequences</a> of climate change, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, reported in 2018 (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). In its latest report, released in August, the IPCC noted that extreme weather events, exacerbated by human-caused climate change, now occur in every part of the planet — and warned that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the window to reverse some of these effects is closing</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>





<p>Despite these dire warnings, “the parties to the Paris Agreement are utterly failing to keep [its] target in reach,” said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. “The era of half measures and hollow promises must end.”</p>



<p>The new U.N. report comes at a crucial time, just days before world leaders meet for the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. The COP26 meeting — postponed from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic — holds particular significance because it is the first COP meeting since the 2015 agreement in which signatories are expected to significantly ramp up their emissions reductions pledges.</p>



<p>The U.N. Environment Programme has kept annual tabs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">on the still-yawning gap</a> between existing national pledges to reduce emissions and the Paris Agreement target (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). Ahead of the COP26 meeting, 120 countries, responsible for emitting just over half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, announced their new commitments to address climate change by 2030.</p>



<p>The 2021 report finds that new commitments bring the world only slightly closer to where emissions need to be by 2030 to reach warming targets. With the new pledges, total annual emissions in 2030 would be 7.5 percent lower (about 55 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent) than they would have been with pledges as of last year (about 59 gigatons). But to stay on track for 2 degrees C of warming, emissions would have to be about 30 percent lower than the new pledges, or about 39 gigatons each year. To hold warming to 1.5 degrees C requires a roughly 55 percent drop in emissions compared with the latest pledges, to about 25 gigatons a year.</p>



<p>“I’m hoping that the collision of the science and the statistics in the gap analysis, and the voices of the people will promote a greater sense of urgency,” says Gabriel Filippelli, a geochemist at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.</p>



<p>On October 26, Filippelli, the editor of the American Geophysical Union journal <em>GeoHealth</em>, and editors in chief of other journals published by the organization coauthored a statement in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. Theyurged world leaders at COP26 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL096644">to keep the “devastating impacts” of climate change in check</a> by immediately reducing global carbon emissions and shifting to a green economy. “We are scientists, but we also have families and loved ones alongside our fellow citizens on this planet,” the letter states. “The time to bridge the divide between scientist and citizen, head and heart, is now.”</p>



<p>Publishing that plea was a departure for some of the scientists, Filippelli says. “We have been publishing papers for the last 20 to 30 years, documenting the train wreck of climate change,” he says. “As you can imagine, behind the scenes there were some people who were a little uncomfortable because it veered away from the true science. But ultimately, we felt it was more powerful to write a true statement that showed our hearts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-needles-freeze-thaw-patterns">Here’s how ice needles sculpt patterns into cold, rocky landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neat rings, stripes and swirls embellish many cold, rocky landscapes. Although these beautiful stone patterns look like humanmade artwork, they’re all natural. Scientists have long known that such rocky patterns result from freezing and thawing. But precisely how they develop has been a mystery — until now.</p>



<p>New experiments reveal that so-called <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2110670118">“ice needles” can sort and organize rocks into many patterns</a>, Anyuan Li of the University of Tsukuba in Japan and colleagues report the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></p>



<p>“The beauty of [our] experiments is that you can actually see direct information on how the patterns form,” says Bernard Hallet of the University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied natural patterns in surface rocks around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="420" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-800x420.jpg" alt="zebra stripe landscape pattern" class="wp-image-3105038" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-800x420.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-680x357.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-330x173.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102021_BG_ice-needles_inline-1.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105038">Like zebra stripes, these ridges are all natural. They were photographed along an upper slope of the Haleakala volcanic crater on the Hawaiian island of Maui. This pattern formed on top of the gravelly surface as ice needles gradually separated stones from soil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105038">B. Hallet</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers spread pebbles atop a pan holding moist, fine-grained soil, then froze and thawed this mini-landscape over and over. When the moist soil had not yet frozen but the air temperature dropped below freezing, tiny, needlelike columns of ice sprouted up from the soil. These ice needles, each up to a few centimeters high, lifted any stones atop them. When temperatures rose again, the ice collapsed and the stones tumbled off. Because the ice needles curved as they grew, the stones tended to fall off their icy pedestals to one side.</p>



<p>Over many freeze-thaw cycles, the ice needles cleared patches of exposed soil. Since needles could more easily form in spots where there were fewer rocks in the way, they more efficiently cleared out any remaining pebbles. Stones were gradually shuffled into clusters between stone-free areas to form larger patterns. The pattern that builds on a landscape “strongly depends on its [local stone] concentration,” says study coauthor Quan-Xing Liu, a theoretical ecologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai.</p>

Hallet</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In lab experiments, the team “was able to able to get patterns after 30 freeze cycles,” says Hallet. That could equate to 30 cold nights — or 30 years, if each freeze lasted a whole winter. In the real world, Hallet says, some patterns might take “thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years to form.”</p>



<p>Using observations from their soil experiments, the researchers built a computer simulation of ice needle landscaping. This simulation could predict stone movement in the open environment under a range of conditions. The simulation confirmed that the rate of pattern formation depended on how dense the stone cover was, among other factors. The shapes and formation rates of patterns were also related to how moist the soil was, how the ground sloped and how tall the ice needles grew.</p>

</div><figcaption>As a miniature landscape made in the laboratory undergoes many freeze-thaw cycles, ice needles form and collapse, gradually shuffling stones into bunches, forming a larger pattern.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“We see identical patterns in different systems, such as fluids,” Hallet says of the rock formations. Materials with different characteristics or sizes often start all mixed together <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-nut-effect-mixed-nuts-xray-scan-physics">but don’t stay that way</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/21</em>). Phase separation is the process that morphs these mixes into patterns. The new study is among the first to show how phase separation applies to landscapes.</p>



<p>The combination of experiments and computer modelling in this study provides a new way to connect how natural landscapes form and how their materials behave, says Rachel Glade, a geologist at the University of Rochester in New York who was not involved in the work. This approach “is vital for our understanding of complex materials,” she adds, and it could help us understand how landscapes may evolve differently in a changing climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flamingo-feathers-dye-pink-biology">Flamingos dye their sun-faded feathers to stay pretty in pink</a></h4>

              
                <p>Greater flamingos apparently aren’t fans of a sun-faded look for their neck feathers.</p>



<p>Scientists have known that the leggy birds touch up their color by smearing their necks with a serum they produce glands near their tails. But greater flamingos (<em>Phoenicopterus roseus</em>) aren’t simply enhancing color that’s already there; they’re also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.8041">fighting the sun’s bleaching effect</a> on it, researchers report in the October <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. Feathers with a thicker coating of this serum held their color better than those with less, analysis shows.</p>



<p>Flamingos’ feathers help the birds fly, keep their bodies dry and attract mates. The feathers get their red color from carotenoids, molecules responsible for many natural pigments, found in the birds’ steady diet of brine shrimp and algae.</p>



<p>When flamingos preen, they care for their feathers a bit like how we care for our hair, cleaning out accumulated dirt and parasites. And like some of us, they add color. To apply their DIY feather dye, flamingos rub their cheeks on a gland above their tail called the uropygial gland, which generates a color-carrying serum. The birds then rub their serum-coated cheeks on their feathers and sway their necks to make sure the dye sticks. All that effort, paired with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36242">some slick dance moves</a>, is aimed at attracting potential mates.</p>





<p>But the sun’s ultraviolet radiation can break down carotenoids. That got Maria Cecilia Chiale, a biologist at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina, wondering if flamingos lose their color without constant reapplication of the serum. If so, that might help explain their instinct to constantly “touch up” their plumage.</p>



<p>Chiale and her collaborators collected dozens of neck feathers from flamingos in France that had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/french-flamingos-froze-death-without-freezing">died in a cold snap</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/14</em>). The team scanned the feathers and used Adobe Photoshop to analyze their color, and then placed half of them on a roof, exposed to sunlight. The other half were kept in darkness. Forty days later, new scans to analyze the feathers’ color intensity showed that the exposed feathers were sun-faded and paler than those kept in the dark.</p>



<p>Before the exposure experiment, Chiale had extracted carotenoids from both the surface and interior of each feather. After exposure, she found that feathers with a greater concentration of carotenoids had kept more color. That suggests that the birds had applied more serum to those feathers, letting them withstand fading better than those with a thinner coating.</p>



<p>Flamingos actively work to maintain their blushed necks throughout their lengthy display season as they prepare to mate, the research suggests; otherwise, they’d have pale feathers.</p>



<p>“Preening behaviors … have great social importance for flamingos because they live in large flocks and have synchronized behavior,” says Henrique Delfino, an ecologist at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil who was not involved in the study. “Initially, the behavior was for [waterproofing], but since it reinforces the color signal of the feathers … it helps in the social communication of flamingos.” Without flashy feathers to advertise their health, flamingos probably struggle to find a partner.</p>



<p>All that preening to prevent feather fade doesn’t continue forever, though. Once they’ve snagged a mate and successfully hatched a chick, Chiale says, flamingos put the dye away, at least until the next year’s mating season. The concentration of carotenoids in the serum drops dramatically, and the flamingos apply it far less frequently.</p>



<p>“They don’t need to have makeup on while they’re raising the kids,” she says. They need that energy to take care of their chicks.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Rumination is a key feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. According to the charity <a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/types/">OCD UK</a>, rumination is a “train of prolonged thinking about a question or theme that is undirected and unproductive” — worrying incessantly about a particular issue or question, in other words. Those with OCD may also ruminate on their symptoms themselves: rather than just dwelling on their fears of harming someone or on existential worries, for example, they will also worry about having these thoughts in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s this rumination about symptoms that a team of researchers explore in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-81553-001">new study </a>in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. They find that this kind of rumination can prolong depression in those with OCD, suggesting interventions focusing on ruminative patterns could be one way of addressing the distress of such experiences.</p>



<span id="more-44208"></span>



<p>Participants were visitors to inpatient and outpatient clinics specialising in treating OCD, as well as members of a self-help peer support group. First, they completed standardised measures of mood, the severity of their obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptoms, and their baseline level of rumination.</p>



<p>Before the experiment proper started, participants also identified an obsessive thought that would likely cause distress when spoken aloud. They then discussed this with a member of the research team, writing down and reading aloud a few sentences about the potential consequences of the thought. Finally, participants indicated their level of distress and their desire to neutralise that distress.</p>



<p>After &#8220;activating&#8221; the obsessive thought in this way, participants were asked to think about whatever they wanted in the next five minutes, recording how many times they thought about what they had written down and then again rating their level of distress and urge to neutralise.</p>



<p>Participants were then split into three groups. In each condition, individuals saw 28 statements and questions. In the rumination on OCD condition, these statements included “what would happen if your obsessions and compulsions persisted”; in the rumination on mood condition, “what would happen if your current mental state persisted”; and in the distraction condition more neutral statements such as “think about the shadow of a stop sign”.</p>



<p>Finally, at the end of this phase of the experiment participants again rated their feelings of distress, urge to neutralise, and depressed mood, and then completed another five minute session of monitoring their thoughts and rating themselves again.</p>



<p>Compared to those in the control condition, participants who ruminated on their symptoms or mood saw less of a decrease in distress, urge to neutralise and depressed mood by the end of the experiment. The frequency of obsessive thoughts also declined to a smaller degree in these conditions than in the distraction condition. There was no significant difference between the rumination on OCD and rumination on mood conditions.</p>



<p>So, overall, the results suggest that rumination on symptoms or mood can actually maintain those symptoms. Those who are distracted from rumination, however, may be less likely to experience ongoing levels of distress.</p>



<p>The results are unlikely to reflect the reality of ruminations for those with OCD: because episodes of ruminations are often extremely long, the effects of eight minutes of rumination in this experiment are potentially an underestimation of those someone may experience in real life settings. Looking more closely at a natural setting could provide further insight. The team also used a &#8220;counter&#8221; technique, with participants indicating how many times they had experienced a obsessive thought: whether this was able to fully capture the obsessive and ongoing nature of such thoughts is also a question worth pondering.</p>



<p>In terms of intervention, the team suggests techniques that supplement the standard CBT many of those with OCD receive, including trying to practise an “observing, non-judgemental and accepting stance” towards the occurrence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. They also note the questions the results raise about distraction. While distraction is often seen as maladaptive, this study showed it had positive effects — so, while perhaps not a long-term strategy, it could be a short-term balm for those struggling with rumination of any kind.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">Astronomers may have spotted the first known exoplanet in another galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers may have spotted the first known planet in another galaxy.</p>



<p>The potential world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01495-w">called M51-ULS-1b</a>, orbits both a massive star and a dead star in the Whirlpool galaxy, about 28 million light-years from Earth. The object’s existence, if confirmed, suggests that there could be many other extragalactic exoplanets waiting to be discovered, astronomers report October 25 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>“We probably always assumed there would be planets” in other galaxies, says astrophysicist Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “But to actually find something, it’s a beautiful thing. It’s a humbling experience.”</p>



<p>More than 4,800 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the sun, all of them inside the Milky Way. There’s no reason to think that other galaxies don’t also host planets. But the most popular exoplanet hunting techniques are difficult to do with such faraway stars, which blend together too much to observe them one by one.</p>





<p>In 2018, Di Stefano and astrophysicist Nia Imara of the University of California, Santa Cruz suggested <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab903">searching for planets around extragalactic X-ray binaries</a>.</p>



<p>X-ray binaries usually consist of a massive star and the remains of a second massive star, which has collapsed into a neutron star or a black hole. The dead star steals material from the living star and heats it to such hot temperatures that it emits bright X-rays that stand out from the crowd of other stars.</p>



<p>That X-ray region can be smaller than a giant planet, meaning if a planet crosses, or transits, in front of such a system from astronomers’ perspective on Earth, it could temporarily block all the X-rays, revealing the planet’s presence.</p>



<p>Di Stefano and colleagues searched archived data from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-chandra-x-ray-telescope-celebrates-20-years-space">NASA’s Chandra X-ray telescope</a> for signs of blinking X-ray sources (<em>SN: 7/25/19</em>). The team looked at a total of 2,624 possible transits in three galaxies: M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy), M101 (the Pinwheel galaxy) and M104 (the Sombrero galaxy).</p>



<p>Only one turned up a clear planetlike signal. On September 20, 2012, an object had blocked all of the X-rays from the X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 for about three hours.</p>



<p>“We said, ‘Wow. Could this be it?’” Di Stefano says.</p>



<p>After ruling out gas clouds passing in front of the binary, fluctuations in the X-ray source itself or other explanations for the dip, Di Stefano and colleagues conclude that the object was most likely a Saturn-sized planet orbiting the X-ray binary at tens of times the distance between Earth and the sun.</p>



<p>This isn’t a comfortable environment for the planet. “You don’t want to be there,” Di Stefano notes. Despite its distance from the X-ray binary, the planet receives as much energy in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scalding-hot-gas-giant-breaks-heat-records">hot Jupiter</a> exoplanet, which orbits its star in just a few days, receives from an ordinary star (<em>SN: 6/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>“The possibility that the team discovered the transit of an extragalactic planet is quite intriguing and would be a great discovery,” says astrophysicist Ignazio Pillitteri of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in Palermo. He would like to see the transit happen again to confirm it.</p>



<p>Not everyone finds the result convincing. “I find the paper very speculative,” says astrophysicist Matthew Bailes of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. If the planet is real, finding it relied on a lot of coincidences: Its orbit needed to be perfectly aligned with the point of view from Earth, and it needed to just happen to be passing in front of the X-ray binary while Chandra was looking.</p>



<p>Di Stefano counters that the fact that her team saw a signal within such a small number of observations suggests there are lots of extragalactic planets out there. “Maybe we were lucky,” she acknowledges. “But I think it’s very likely that we were not special. We looked and we found something because there was something to find.”</p>



<p>Di Stefano doesn’t expect to see this particular planet again in her lifetime. It could take decades for it to pass in front of its host stars again. “The real test,” she says, “is finding more planets.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-blueprint-olmec-maya-ceremonial-archaeology">Lidar reveals a possible blueprint for many Olmec and Maya ceremonial sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unexpected architectural tradition linked many Olmec and Maya societies of Mesoamerica, an ancient cultural area that ran from central Mexico to Central America.</p>



<p>Starting as early as around 3,400 years ago and for roughly the next two millennia, those communities constructed ceremonial centers based on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01218-1">a common blueprint</a>. That plan was grounded in ideas about space, the calendar and possibly beliefs about the universe, researchers report October 25 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>



<p>An airborne remote-sensing technique called light detection and ranging, or lidar, revealed 478 rectangular and square ceremonial centers across Mexico’s southern Gulf Coast, over an area roughly the size of Ireland. Lidar maps detected remnants of ceremonial centers dotting the landscape in an Olmec homeland area and stretching westward around 500 kilometers to the Maya lowlands, say archaeologist Takeshi Inomata of the University of Arizona in Tucson and his colleagues.</p>



<p>Olmec society dates from around 3,500 to 2,400 years ago. Its relation to later Maya culture is unclear, although Maya and Olmec people may have influenced each other’s cultures between 3,000 and 2,800 years ago, Inomata suspects.</p>





<p>“The discovery of standardized [ceremonial] complexes across this broad area, many of them having rectangular shapes, forces us to rethink what was happening during this period,” Inomata says. A continuous 2,000-year tradition of ceremonial complex construction now appears to have characterized Mesoamerican settlements of various sizes and political arrangements.</p>



<p>New lidar data from so many Mesoamerican sites “reveals an astonishing reality — the sheer vastness of what we didn’t know about the emergence of urbanism in this part of the world,” says archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli of Tulane University in New Orleans, who was not part of Inomata’s team.</p>



<p>Although ground surveys and excavations of lidar-detected sites are in the early stages, many probably date to between 1050 B.C. and 400 B.C. Inomata’s team has surveyed 62 sites in a western portion of the lidar-mapped area and excavated five of them.</p>



<p>In a major revelation, lidar data detected a previously unrecognized ceremonial space at an early Olmec settlement called San Lorenzo. Dating to between 1400 B.C. and 1150 B.C., this area consisted of 20 rectangular earthen mounds bordering a large, rectangular plaza.</p>

<p>San Lorenzo’s ceremonial center provided the original framework for corresponding constructions at later sites, Inomata’s team says. Until this discovery, San Lorenzo’s layout had been viewed as different from all other sites in the region.</p>



<p>Later complexes included rectangular or square plazas surrounded by 20 mounds. That number probably represented the base unit of Mesoamerican calendars, which were used to organize ritual activities, the scientists say. Some centers were built along an east-to-west axis that aligned with the sunrise on ritually important days of the year.</p>



<p>A site previously excavated by Inomata and his colleagues contains the largest rectangular ceremonial complex discovered so far. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico">Aguada Fénix</a> in the western Maya lowlands features an elevated, rectangular plateau that measures about 1,400 meters long and nearly 400 meters wide (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). That site dates to around 3,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Frequent contacts among diverse societies across the region resulted in the initial spread of the San Lorenzo ceremonial blueprint and the adoption of a sequence of four variations on that theme over the next 2,000 years, Inomata’s team suggests. Shared ceremonial center configurations appeared despite differences in Mesoamerican political systems. For instance, colossal head sculptures at San Lorenzo and another Olmec center, La Venta, reflect the presence there of class systems run by kings and a ruling elite. But other sites with ceremonial centers, including Aguada Fénix, show no signs of ruling classes or marked social inequality.</p>



<p>Innovations in building ceremonial complexes appear to have emerged elsewhere possibly by around 100 years after San Lorenzo got the ball rolling, Estrada-Belli says. Around 3,000 years ago, for instance, structures that lidar data indicate were added to the basic ceremonial configuration at Aguada Fénix, as well as architectural twists originating at several other Gulf Coast sites, began spreading to other parts of the region, he says. Inomata’s lidar evidence “shows that San Lorenzo was one of multiple places of monumental architectural innovation.”</p>



<p>So many <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01219-0">commonalities link the newly identified ceremonial complexes</a> across Mexico’s Gulf Coast that it’s hard to sort their builders into different cultures, says archaeologist Robert Rosenswig of the University at Albany in New York, who did not participate in the lidar study. “It would be realistic to refer to them all as Olmec, especially as the architecture of Maya in Guatemala and Belize seems to be quite different,” he says.</p>



<p>Lidar surveys are uncovering shared architectural designs, layouts and orientations across other Mesoamerican regions, adds Rosenswig, who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>. Rosenswig has contributed to research documenting such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/money-ancient-origins-debate-mystery">consistencies in a network of city-states</a> on the Pacific coast of southern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador that flourished between around 2,800 and 2,100 years ago (<em>SN: 7/29/18</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-vision-eyes-color-senses-hearing-mating-courtship">Jumping spiders’ remarkable senses capture a world beyond our perception</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Imagine that the world is shades of gray and a little blurry, almost as if your lousy peripheral vision has taken over. This fuzzy field of view extends so far that you can make out dim shapes and motion behind you as well; no need to turn your head. The one bright spot is an X-shaped splash of color that moves with your gaze. At the center of this splash, everything is crisp and clear — a small window of sharp, colorful detail in a gauzy grayscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add some blades of grass the size of redwood trees, and you’ve got an inkling of what the world looks like through the eight eyes of a jumping spider. It might be a bit like watching a poorly focused black-and-white movie on a 3-D IMAX screen that wraps around the room, while you hold a spotlight shining high-definition color wherever you point it. In other words, it’s really, really strange, at least compared with our two-eyed human perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jumping spiders, which are the family Salticidae, are best known for their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/male-peacock-spiders-best-dancers-get-girl">hilariously flamboyant mating dances</a>, their large front eyes that make for adorable close-ups and their itty-bitty size — some of the more than 6,000 known species of jumping spiders are smaller than a sesame seed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But scientists are discovering that there’s much more to these diminutive arachnids. Researchers are getting a sense of what it’s like to be another animal by doing innovative experiments to go deeper into these spiders’ lives, probing their ability to see, feel and taste.</p>





<p>“Part of why I study insects and spiders is this act of imagination that is required to really try to get into the completely alien world and mind and perceptual reality of these animals,” says visual ecologist Nathan Morehouse of the University of Cincinnati.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Eye of the spider&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Unlike bees and flies, which have compound eyes that merge information from hundreds or thousands of lenses into a single, pixelated mosaic image, the jumping spider has camera-type eyes, similar to those of humans and most other vertebrates. Each of the spider’s eyes has a single lens that focuses light onto a retina.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principal eyes — the big forward-facing ones that just beg us to anthropomorphize — have incredibly high resolution for creatures that are usually between 2 and 20 millimeters long. Their eyesight is sharper than any other spider’s and is the secret behind their ability to stalk and pounce on prey with impressive precision. Their sight is comparable to that of much larger animals like pigeons, cats and elephants. In fact, human visual acuity is only about five to 10 times better than a jumping spider’s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="541" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-2.png" alt="diagram showing the principal eyes and the secondary eyes" class="wp-image-3105004" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-2.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-2-481x383.png 481w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-2-566x450.png 566w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-2-234x186.png 234w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105004">A jumping spider’s eight eyes, magnified above with a scanning electron microscope, combine for a nearly 360-degree view of the world. The large, forward-facing principal eyes see in color and have the highest resolution known for such a small animal.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3105004">STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE SOURCE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Given that you can fit a lot of spiders in one single human eyeball, that is pretty remarkable,” says animal behavior researcher Ximena Nelson, who studies jumping spiders at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. “In terms of size-for-size, there’s just no comparison whatsoever to the type of spatial acuity that jumping spider eyes can achieve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that sharp vision covers only a small portion of the spider’s field of view. Each of the two principal eyes sees a narrow, boomerang-shaped strip of the world. Together they form an “X” of high-resolution color vision. An adjacent pair of smaller, less sharp eyes scans a wide field of view in black and white, watching for things that need the attention of the big high-resolution eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the side of the spider’s head are two more pairs of lower-resolution eyes that any human parent would envy. They let the spider monitor what’s happening behind it, a nearly 360-degree view that’s a real advantage for a small animal that is both hunter and prey. Indeed, a jumping spider might consider our 210-degree field of view rather pitiful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in other ways, a jumping spider’s visual world is not so different from ours. The animal’s principal eyes and first set of secondary eyes together do basically the same job as our two eyes with our high-acuity central vision and low-resolution peripheral vision. Like the spider, we focus our attention on a relatively small area and largely ignore the rest until something catches our attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I totally think of them as completely analogous,” Nelson says. “The jumping spider’s solution is exactly the solution we’ve adopted. They’ve just adopted it in a much smaller manner.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Giving the side eye</h4>



<p>Each of the jumping spider’s four pairs of eyes has a different job and behaves independently, but they all work together. This cooperation opens up intriguing research possibilities for behavioral ecologist Elizabeth Jakob of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I’m really interested in how the eyes collaborate,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jakob uses an ophthalmoscope modified to create a spider eye tracker. With removable adhesive, she tethers a female <em>Phidippus audax</em> to the end of a small plastic stick. Then, she hangs the stick with its spider in front of the eye tracker, the spider perched on a little ball facing a video screen. Once the spider is in position, Jakob plays videos. As the spider watches, she records how the principal eyes react.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tracker shines an infrared light at the retinas of the principal eyes while a video camera records the reflected, X-shaped field of view. The reflection is later superimposed on the video the spider viewed, revealing exactly what the spider’s principal eyes were focused on. For a human, watching the combined video is like peering through a portal into the spider’s visual world.</p>



<p>Jakob teases out the relationships between the eyes by showing various images to different eye pairs. In a study published April 15 in the<em> Journal of Experimental Biology</em>, Jakob and her colleagues tried to determine which kinds of objects seen by the secondary eyes would prompt a spider to swing the principal eyes over for a sharper look. This test probes more than just how the eyes work together; it gets at <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/224/8/jeb231035/239722/Attention-and-distraction-in-the-modular-visual">what’s important to a jumping spider</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s just so interesting to see what captures their attention,” Jakob says. “To just get this little window into their mind.”</p>



<p>First, a silhouette of a cricket — an appealing meal for a jumping spider — appears on the screen. You can tell when the spider’s principal eyes have locked onto the cricket because the boomerangs start wiggling, rapidly scanning the silhouette while slightly twisting one way and then the other. The spider’s principal eyes can do this sort of visual gymnastics because the retinas are at the back of two long, independently movable tubes, each controlled by six muscles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out what might draw the spider’s focus away from the cricket, Jakob adds other images to an area of the screen that is within the field of view of the secondary eyes. Any interest in a black oval? Nope. Maybe a black cross? Or another cricket? Not impressed. How about a black oval that is shrinking? Still no. What if the oval is getting bigger? Bingo: The boomerangs quickly flit over to the expanding oval to get a better look.</p>



<p>A jumping spider’s principal eyes can concentrate on preparing to pounce on dinner, while the other eyes notice and ignore any number of less relevant things. But if those secondary eyes spot something that’s getting bigger, well, that could be an approaching predator that requires immediate attention. It’s a nifty design — one that could make an easily distracted human jealous.</p>



<p>“We’re swimming in a sea of potential stimuli all the time,” Jakob says. One way to filter that information is to prioritize, focusing attention on some things over others. “This is certainly familiar to any human trying to focus on reading one thing.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How to see what a spider sees</h3>

<p>A jumping spider perched on a foam ball (and tethered in place with a plastic stick and removable adhesive) watches videos while a special eye tracker records where the spider’s principal eyes are looking. Researchers can tell that a jumping spider is focusing its principal eyes on a cricket silhouette when the white X lands and stays on the cricket, as seen in the video below. While the principal eyes focus on the cricket, the researchers add shapes like a growing or receding oval in view of the secondary eyes. Only when the oval is growing do the principal eyes shift their focus to the oval. An object growing in the periphery just might be an approaching predator.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on color</h4>



<p>Among mammals, humans and many other primates have exceptional color vision. Most people can see three colors of light — red, blue and green — and all the various combinations of hues in between. Many other mammals typically see just some shades of blue and green light. Many spiders may also have a crude form of color vision, but for them it’s usually based on green and ultraviolet light, which extends their vision into the deep violet end of the spectrum beyond what humans can see, and covers the blue and purple hues in between.</p>



<p>But some jumping spiders see even more. While at the University of Pittsburgh, Morehouse led a team that discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215003486">certain species have a filter</a> squashed between two layers of green-sensitive photo-receptors that allows these spiders to detect red light in a small area at the center of their principal eye field of view. This adds red, orange and yellow hues to their world, which, along with the UV, gives them an even wider rainbow of colors than humans.</p>



<p>Seeing red can be handy since it’s often used as a warning, in nature as well as in the human&#8211;engineered world of red lights and stop signs. For jumping spiders, the ability to see red may have evolved as a way to avoid toxic prey. But once this new world of color was available to the spiders, they put it to good use. “The evolution of color vision seems to be followed by the rapid use of the new colors that they can see in courtship,” Morehouse says.</p>



<p>Using Jakob’s eye tracker, Morehouse is testing female jumping spiders to see what interests them about the colorful, frenetic dances males use to woo them. He’s finding that suitors employ a combination of movement and color that seems specifically designed to capture and hold a female’s attention by playing to her various eyes. She can only see color within the boomerang&#8211;shaped view of her principal eyes, and the red, orange and yellow hues only at the center. Unless he can grab the attention of her secondary eyes with movement, she won’t turn her principal eyes toward him and may never see his fabulously colored features. And for him, this could be a matter of life and death, because an unimpressed female may decide to make a meal of him instead.</p>



<p>The males of one species Morehouse studies, <em>Habronattus pyrrithrix</em>, have a dazzling red face and beautiful lime-green front legs. Yet the females seem most impressed by the orange knees on the males’ third set of legs. When a male first spots a female, he raises his front legs like he’s directing a plane into its gate and skitters side to side, hoping to catch the attention of her secondary eyes. When she turns his way, he comes closer and starts flicking the wrist joints at the end of his raised front limbs. You can almost hear him saying, “Hey lady, over here!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once he’s drawn her attention, out come the orange knees. “They move them up behind their back into view in a kind of a peekaboo display,” Morehouse says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>As part of his showy courtship dance, a male <em>Habronattus pyrrithrix</em> waves his front legs as if to say, “Look at me,” then lifts the bright orange knees of two back legs. The female (foreground) is transfixed. Within minutes, he’s won her over.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To find out exactly what it is about a male’s display that turns a female’s head, Morehouse uses a bit of subterfuge. He doctors videos of males dancing, then plays the videos to a female perched in an eye tracker to see how each of the changes affects her attention. If the male has an orange knee hiked up, but it’s not moving, she’s less interested. If the knees are moving but the orange color is removed, she’ll look but quickly lose interest. He’s got to have both the right look and the right moves.</p>



<p>“He’s using motion to influence where she’s looking, and then he’s using color to hold her attention there,” Morehouse says.</p>



<p>Behavioral ecologist Lisa Taylor of the University of Florida in Gainesville, likens the males’ tactics to those of human advertisers. “It feels like a lot of the tricks that marketers use to influence our decisions,” Taylor says. “Understanding the psychology of spiders sometimes feels similar to understanding the psychology of humans.”</p>



<h4>Can you feel it?</h4>



<p>The leg-waving, knee-popping spectacle of the male courtship display is meant to capture female attention. But this dance is only one part of the show, behavioral ecologist Damian Elias of the University of California, Berkeley discovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many spiders use vibrations to communicate, and there had been a few reports that jumping spiders were among them. When Elias investigated further, he found that male jumping spiders accompany their moves with a remarkably elaborate serenade of vibrations, sent through the ground to the females, beyond human perception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was a complete surprise to me,” Elias says. When he shared what he had found with other arachnologists, “they were just blown away.”</p>

</div><figcaption>Turn up your sound to hear a male jumping spider thumping, scraping and buzzing to impress a potential mate. The vibrations he makes with his legs and abdomen are sent through the ground to the female, beyond human perception. But researchers can pick up the seismic songs using laser vibrometry.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To eavesdrop on the spiders’ seismic songs, Elias <a href="https://www.biographic.com/lens-of-time-spider-seduction/">uses a laser vibrometer</a>, similar to technology used in the aeronautics industry to measure vibration of airplane components. He tethers a female spider onto a nylon surface stretched like a drumhead and then adds a male. When the male spots the female, he starts his song and dance, drumming his legs on the surface and vibrating his abdomen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vibrometer measures the vibration of the surface and translates it into airborne sound that humans can hear, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-48/issue-3/JoA-S-18-045/Complex-courtship-in-the-Habronattus-clypeatus-group-Araneae-Salticidae/10.1636/JoA-S-18-045.short">revealing an acoustic barrage of thumps, scrapes and buzzes</a>. Elias simultaneously records video of the courtship at 1,000 frames per second so he can slow it down to see how the sound and motion sync up. It’s like a miniature drum solo, perfectly matched to the spider’s flicks and kicks.</p>



<p>“We don’t have access to that without technology,” Elias says. “It’s kind of unlocking this secret world.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Good vibrations</h3>



<p>Male jumping spiders work hard to get and keep a potential mate’s attention. By tapping his front legs and oscillating his abdomen at various speeds, measured in hertz, or Hz, a male can produce three types of seismic signals that researchers can pick up using laser vibrometry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3105005" width="510" height="338" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3-579x383.png 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-3-281x186.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3105005">D. ELIAS <em>ET AL/J. EXP. BIOL.</em> 2003</span></figcaption></figure></div>
</div>



<p>The jumping spider’s sensory world is filled with vibrations coming through the ground. But because those vibrations feel different depending on what the spider is standing on, things can change quickly as he hops from leaf to rock to soil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For humans, who sense sound vibrations through the air rather than the ground, Elias imagines it might be something like taking two steps and suddenly listening through water, and then another two steps and you’re surrounded by foam, and then back to air. The spiders’ entire sensory world is constantly changing, yet they adapt without missing a beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, take that alien auditory world and add the fact that jumping spiders also have chemical sensors at the tips of their legs. “They’re moving around, tasting everything that they’re walking on,” Elias says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very little is known about this aspect of the jumping spider’s sensorium, but the latest research out of Taylor’s Florida lab, published July 29 in the <em>Journal of Arachnology</em>, suggests that <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-49/issue-2/JoA-S-20-055/Males-respond-to-substrate-borne-not-airborne-female-chemical-cues/10.1636/JoA-S-20-055.full">male spiders may be hoping to taste traces of potential mates</a>. Most jumping spiders don’t build webs to capture prey; they stalk and pounce instead. But the spiders are constantly laying down a line of silk as they move about, a sort of safety rope in case they fall or need to make a quick escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, a male <em>H. pyrrithrix</em> could sense a female’s silk line when he stepped on it. Taylor’s lab is now testing whether a male spider can detect the difference between a silk trail that will lead him to a virgin female who might be willing to mate with him and a dragline left by a female who has already mated and might prefer to eat him.</p>



<p>“The more we learn, the more complicated it gets,” Taylor says. Jumping spiders “are so highly visual, and there’s so much vibrational stuff going on, and then the chemistry. It’s hard to imagine that it wouldn’t just be super overwhelming.”</p>



<p>Somehow, jumping spiders manage the sensory deluge quite well — they live just about everywhere on Earth. You’ve most likely seen one, possibly in your own house. Despite being so small, they are easy to identify if you know what you’re looking for — or what <em>they’re</em> looking for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Next time you see a spider in the middle of a wall, and you look at it, and it turns back and looks at you, that’s a jumping spider,” University of Canterbury’s Nelson says. “It’s detected your movement towards it with its secondary eyes, and it’s checking you out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That spider might just be imagining what the world looks like to a human. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Fly tigers</h3>



<p>One of the things jumping spiders use their unusually good vision for is, well, jumping. Instead of building webs to passively snare meals, the spiders prefer to hunt. Their ability to quickly and accurately pounce on insects and other spiders earned them the moniker “fly tiger” more than 500 years ago during the Ming dynasty in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists are learning just how apt the nickname is. At least one group of jumping spider species plans out strategic attacks involving elaborate detours to reach a target — the kind of clever hunting behavior typically ascribed to large-brained mammals like actual tigers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-410x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3105006" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-410x450.png 410w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-349x383.png 349w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-170x186.png 170w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4-529x580.png 529w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/110621_jumping-spider_inline-4.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3105006">Starting on the middle tower on this platform, a jumping spider sets a course to reach the only box that is holding a meal.

CROSS <em>ET AL/FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY</em> 2020, ADAPTED BY T. TIBBITTS</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Some of the things that they do could keep you awake at night,” says arachnologist Fiona Cross of the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cross and renowned jumping spider expert Robert Jackson, also at Canterbury, have tested this group of species, including the clever <em>Portia fimbriata</em>, with all sorts of challenges in the lab. In one study, the team placed a spider atop a tower on a platform (shown here) surrounded by water, knowing that jumping spiders avoid water whenever possible. From the perch, the spider could see two other towers: one topped with a box containing prey and one with a box of dead leaves. Both were accessible from the platform by a raised walkway with multiple turns. After surveying the scene, most spiders climbed down the tower and chose the correct path to the target — even when that required initially heading away from the target, losing sight of the prey, and first passing the start of the incorrect walkway.</p>



<p>This feat suggests that the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jeab.189">spiders are capable of planning</a>, Cross and Jackson argued in 2016 in the <em>Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior</em>. The spiders came up with a strategy, and executed it. — <em>Betsy Mason</em></p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Most parents will be very familiar with the concept of separation anxiety. It’s hardly rare for babies and toddlers to become anxious when separated from a parent. But I have to confess, I hadn’t heard of Adult Separation Anxiety (ASA) until I came across <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-87930-005">this new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>. For adults, it can manifest as extreme distress at being separated from a partner, or another loved one — even a pet. And it’s thought that <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1074">7% of people</a> suffer from it at some point in their lifetimes.</p>



<p>Partly because ASA has been so neglected by researchers, Megan Finsaas at Columbia University and Daniel Klein at Stony Brook University set out to better understand it — and specifically, to explore links with aspects of personality.</p>



<span id="more-44203"></span>



<p>The pair studied data on US-based mothers from 609 families involved in an ongoing study of potential links between children’s temperament and their risk of developing depression. Finsaas and Klein analysed responses to various surveys gathered every three years over a nine-year period. The mothers reported on any symptoms of adult separation anxiety (such as anxiety at the prospect of being separated from a loved one, or fears that that person may suffer harm), mood and also personality. The key personality scale that was used, <a href="https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/multidimensional-personality-questionnaire-short-form-mps/">a short form of the the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ)</a>, assessed the traits of negative emotionality, positive emotionality &nbsp;and constraint (which includes measures of control and harm avoidance). It also assessed the trait of absorption; someone who ranks highly for absorption is prone become wrapped up in their own mental imagery. For some of the women, the researchers also had access to MPQ assessments of them made by their own partners.</p>



<p>Finsaas and Klein found “substantial” links between symptoms of Adult Separation Anxiety and negative emotionality — and particularly, with scores on the subscale of &#8220;stress reaction&#8221;. People who score highly on this often describe themselves as being tense and nervous and prone to worry. (And a tendency to worry maps onto aspects of separation anxiety, including fear that the loved one will come to some kind of harm, the researchers point out.) The mothers with higher ASA scores were also more likely to report greater feelings of vulnerability. This fits with an idea from research on separation anxiety disorder in children — that these children overestimate the dangers of being left alone, and underestimate their ability to function independently.</p>



<p>The results also suggested a link between aggression and ASA. Though aggression is not among the characteristics of ASA listed in DSM-5, it is recognised in children with separation anxiety disorder. For adults, it might stem from a desperation to keep their attachment figure close, when other efforts to do this have failed. Some researchers even suggest that this type of aggression could be linked to at least some cases of domestic violence.</p>



<p>Absorption also emerged as being linked to ASA scores. High levels of absorption have been related in other work to feelings of unity with objects outside the self — such as another person. “For someone with separation anxiety, when an attachment figure leaves, it may feel like a part of the self is leaving and thus be particularly threatening and painful,” Finsaas and Klein write.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that having a &#8220;negative temperament&#8221; (as assessed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_942-2">another questionnaire</a>) was linked to a higher risk of developing ASA three years later.</p>



<p>The study does have some limitations. The participants were all mothers who began providing data when they had a child of about three at home — and having young children may worsen ASA, the researchers write. Most of these women were also White, middle class and in their late 30s and early 40s, restricting generalisability. Also, the nature of the data the pair had to work with means it’s also possible that ASA itself influences personality over time, rather than certain personalities being predisposed to ASA.</p>



<p>However, given that so little work has been done to understand links between personality and adult separation anxiety, this provides a great base for further investigation. And in theory, a better understanding of these links could help with spotting people at risk of developing adult separation anxiety, or with tailoring treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">What does the first successful test of a pig-to-human kidney transplant mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Surgeons in New York City successfully attached a pig kidney to a human patient and watched the pinkish organ function normally for 54 hours. While such procedures have been done in nonhuman primates, this is the first time that a pig kidney has been transplanted to a human body and not been immediately rejected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The procedure, <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/progress-xenotransplantation-opens-door-new-supply-critically-needed-organs">announced in a news conference</a> October 21, marks progress toward the goal of drastically expanding the supply of life-saving organs.&nbsp;Millions of people around the world are waiting for donated organs, many of which never come.</p>



<p>While the details of the procedure have not yet been peer reviewed nor published in a journal, “it’s a significant step,” says Megan Sykes, an immunologist at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the research. But there are many more steps to be taken before patients waiting for a kidney can easily get one from a pig, she says.</p>



<p>Here are answers to some basic questions about the milestone.</p>





<h3>Why pigs?</h3>



<p>“We’re never going to satisfy the organ shortage problem with human organs,” says John Scandling, a nephrologist at Stanford University who wasn’t involved in this research. “There’s a limit to the number of deceased donor organs that are viable,” and too few donations from living people.</p>



<p>In the United States, over 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, about 90 percent of whom need a kidney. But in 2019, less than 40,000 transplantations occurred. About <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">17 people die each day</a> while waiting for an organ, according to the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration.</p>



<p>Scientists have long sought to solve this shortage by using animal organs, a field known as xenotransplantation. Pigs have emerged as the primary focus of this research, since their organs are anatomically similar to human organs, and the animals can be bred in a highly controlled manner.</p>



<p>But simply transplanting another species’s organ into a person causes the immune system to revolt at the presence of a large, foreign object. When researchers tried such experiments using nonhuman primates in the mid-20th century, the scientists found that the transplanted organ would quickly turn black. “You could visibly see the organs fail in those days because there’s an immediate reaction,” Scandling says. That immediate reaction, called a hyperacute rejection, is the first major obstacle for a xenotransplant to stick.</p>



<p>In recent decades, genetic engineering has overcome some of these challenges. Scientists learned that the aggressive immune response seen after a pig xenotransplant is spurred on by antibodies that detect a specific sugar molecule called alpha-gal that dots pig blood vessels. It’s the same sugar molecule responsible for some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lone-star-tick-may-play-part-heart-disease-arteries">allergic reactions to red meat</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/18</em>).</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, scientists devised ways of disabling the pig gene responsible for this sugar.&nbsp;Subsequent studies have shown that kidneys and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baboons-survive-6-months-after-getting-pig-heart-transplant">other organs</a> from pigs with this gene disabled can be successfully transplanted to nonhuman primates, including baboons (<em>SN: 12/5/18</em>). But until now, a test of this sort of transplant hadn’t been done successfully in people.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What did the researchers do?</h3>



<p>Performing a first-of-its-kind operation like this on a living person raises many ethical questions. But in late September, the family of a woman who was brain-dead but kept alive on a ventilator consented to the operation, according to Robert Montgomery, a surgeon at NYU Langone Health in New York City who led the surgical team.&nbsp;She was taken off life support after the procedure.</p>



<p>The woman was an organ donor, but her organs were not suitable for donation. “I want to [acknowledge] how grateful we are to the family of the decedent, who in a time of profound grief, found a way to help their loved one realize her desire to give a gift to humanity at the time of her death,” Montgomery said at the news conference in New York City.</p>



<p>Over two hours, Montgomery and his team carefully attached a kidney from a pig genetically engineered to lack the alpha-gal sugar to blood vessels in the upper leg of the patient. The kidney was kept outside of the body so the team could assess its function in real time. The pig’s thymus gland, which can help educate the immune system to recognize the kidney as part of the body, was also transplanted with the organ to improve its chances of acceptance, Montgomery said. Drugs that suppress the immune system were also administered.</p>



<p>Within minutes, the kidney started producing large amounts of urine and showed other signs of normal functioning. The team kept close tabs on the kidney for 54 hours and saw no signs of rejection. “The pig kidney functioned just like a human kidney transplant,” Montgomery said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team stopped monitoring at 54 hours per guidance from ethics reviewers.</p>



<h3>How big of a deal is the transplant?</h3>



<p>To scientists who have been working in xenotransplantation, the news is welcome and important but not terribly surprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were all pretty confident that hyperacute rejection wouldn’t happen,” says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He notes that pig kidneys of the sort used in this procedure have lasted in nonhuman primates for over a year.</p>



<p>“It’s a proof of principle,” Vagefi says, “but it didn’t really move the needle in terms of the science,” though details of how the surgeons did the procedure could provide a clearer picture of how the patient’s immune system responded, for example.</p>



<p>Peter Cowan, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia agrees. “This is completely as expected, but nevertheless it is an important piece of evidence to support moving to clinical trials of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation.”</p>



<h3>What’s next for these sort of transplants?</h3>



<p>Surviving for 54 hours is a crucial first step, but “nobody needs a kidney for three days,” Vagefi says. Before pig-grown organs can go mainstream, researchers will have to demonstrate that the organs can survive attacks from other players in the immune system and last for months or years in the human body.</p>



<p>For example, over time T-cells, a type of white blood cell, can come to recognize the transplanted organ as foreign and attack. Immunosuppressing drugs can help mitigate these sorts of responses, though the side effects of such drugs, such as susceptibility to infectious diseases, can be a major burden.</p>



<p>Including the pig’s thymus gland, which helps make immune system cells and antibodies, along with the kidney, may help lessen this longer-term rejection, says Kazuhiko Yamada, a surgeon and immunologist at Columbia University who has worked on this method in nonhuman primates for decades. “It’s like a teacher that can educate [the immune system] to not attack the kidney.”</p>



<p>Researchers will also have to show that such transplants are safe in the long-term to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Yamada says. For example, pig organs can contain retroviruses that lie dormant in genes. Some researchers are using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-creates-virus-free-piglets">remove those viruses</a> to potentially improve safety (<em>SN: 8/10/17</em>).</p>



<p>Pigs may be able to provide other organs too, such as hearts or livers, though different organs present their own challenges.</p>



<p>“We’ve been working on this for 20 years,” Yamada says, and now it seems “we’re rounding the final corner and can see the finish line.” But exactly how long it will take before someone in need of a kidney can easily get it from a pig remains to be seen, he says.</p>



<h3>Is raising pigs to harvest their organs ethical?</h3>



<p>A future where potentially millions of pigs are raised to harvest their organs for humans raises significant ethical questions. “Pigs aren’t spare parts and should never be used as such just because humans are too self-centered to donate their bodies to patients desperate for organ transplants,” the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, said <a href="https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-self-centered-humans-should-fix-organ-shortage-not-use-pigs/?v2=1null">in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advocates for xenotransplantation argue the potential benefits of vastly expanding the organ supply are worth any potential harm done to pigs.</p>



<p>“​​Nearly half of the patients waiting for a transplant become too sick or die before receiving one,” said Montgomery, the NYU surgeon. “The traditional paradigm that someone has to die for someone else to live is never going to keep up with the ever increasing incidence of organ failure.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The topic of water fluoridation and oral health addresses both Maha&#8217;s and Morenike&#8217;s research interests. Maha El Tantawi, a Professor of Dental Public Health at Alexandria University, Egypt, and Morenike, a Professor of Paediatric Dentistry at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, often collaborate to investigate the social determinants associated with early childhood caries and oral health status in Nigeria. Maha also researches the impact of public health measures, such as sugar tax and tobacco cessation counselling, on dental health. As well as investigating the risk factors associated with childhood caries, Morenike researches dental anxiety management and the determinants of oral health in marginalised communities. Morenike focuses on community engagement in research and supports the prompt translation of evidence-based research to policies and programs to reduce inequality and improve health and well-being for all. In this blog, Maha and Morenike discuss the articles included in the Collection and how they support the SDGs.</span></p>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BMC Oral Health Collection &#8211; Something in the Water: Fluoridation and Caries</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fluoride is well known to have beneficial effects on dental health by helping to prevent cavities. Therefore, as a public health measure, fluoride is often added to community water supplies. However, when present in drinking water above the World Health Organisation&#8217;s (WHO&#8217;s) recommended concentration, long term exposure can lead to a disease called fluorosis. Fluorosis is characterised by staining and pitting of the teeth but can cause painful damage to bones and joints in severe cases. Therefore, communities must have access to drinking water containing safe levels of fluoride. As a result, water fluoridation is an important discussion topic among dentists, public health practitioners, policymakers and stakeholders interested in oral health and well-being. The review on water fluoridation strategy in England included in the Collection by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-020-01102-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wordley and Bedi</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is an excellent example of such discussion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Collection aligns with multiple SDGs, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#3</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#6</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#8</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#10</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. For example, the Collection supports </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG#3</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by further demonstrating the well-known anti-caries effect of fluorides; this information helps to ensure good health and well-being for all. </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01598-w#auth-Lina-Stangvaltaite_Mouhat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stangvaltaite-Mouhat</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> et al. examined the association between fluoride levels in the drinking water and the susceptibility of different tooth surfaces to caries in Lithuanian adults. The researchers found that higher levels of fluoride (≥ 0.7 ppm) in the drinking water was associated with lower levels of dental caries in all tooth surface groups.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Research within the Collection also aligns with </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #6</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to &#8220;achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all&#8221; and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #10</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which aims for reduced inequalities. The process of water fluoridation includes adjusting the concentration of fluoride in community water to predetermined levels to ensure access to safe drinking water. However, many communities are exposed to high fluoride levels in groundwater, leading to fluorosis. In this Collection, Rojanaworar et al. investigate the prevalence of dental fluorosis within agricultural communities in Thailand exposed to high levels of natural fluoride in groundwater used for household consumption. The researchers demonstrate that the occurrence of dental fluorosis among children exposed to fluoride concentrations in water sources greater than the WHO guideline value of 1.5mg/L is 1.62 times greater than those with drinking water containing the recommended concentration. This research highlights the need for access to safe drinking water in these areas. Furthermore, the Collection features an article by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01754-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rosário et al</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. that describes significant variability of fluoride concentrations in the water from treatment stations in Brazilian cities. Importantly, the group finds that over half of the public water supplies analysed had fluoride concentration levels outside the acceptable range, affecting the Brazilian population&#8217;s risk of developing oral diseases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Articles within the Collection also support </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SDG #8</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to &#8220;promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth&#8221;.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-mangroves-inland-coast-ecosystem-yucatan-peninsula">How these sea-loving mangroves ended up far from the coast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 200 kilometers from the sea, red mangroves thrive in the rainforests along the San Pedro Mártir River on the Yucatán Peninsula. But how did these tangled trees that typically grow in salty water along coasts end up trapped so far inland and in freshwater?</p>



<p>Carlos Burelo has been mulling a version of that question ever since he visited the river on a fishing trip with his father 35 years ago. As a kid, he saw how the mangroves with their twisted aboveground roots were different from other trees, an observation that stuck with him into adulthood as a biologist at the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco in Villahermosa, Mexico.</p>



<p>Now, genetic analyses, surveys of vegetation and sediments and simulations of shifts in sea levels show that the red mangroves (<em>Rhizophora mangle)</em> are part of a “relict ecosystem” that has existed for more than 100,000 years. When warming during the last interglacial period, which peaked about 130,000 years ago, raised sea levels approximately 9 meters above present-day levels, the lowlands of what’s now the Yucatán Peninsula flooded. As a result, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/41/e2024518118">the mangrove forest was displaced and started to grow inland</a> by today’s standards, Burelo and colleagues report in the Oct. 12 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. When sea levels dropped as the world cooled again, the trees were left far from the coast.  </p>



<p>“The remarkable resilience of these trees, in particular, is striking — that although they’re normally adapted to seawater, they&#8217;ve survived all this time inland is incredible,” says Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb who wasn’t involved in the new study.<em></em></p>





<p>To estimate where the mangroves may have been displaced from, the team collected leaves from the trees and from other mangrove forests along the coasts of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and compared the plants’ DNA. That work pinpointed the origins of the inland mangroves about 170 kilometers away along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>



<p>By comparing the number of DNA mutations in the inland population with the other mangroves and by estimating the ages of the trees using tree cores, “we were able to infer [that the San Pedro mangroves] have been isolated for 120,000 years,” says Felipe Zapata, an evolutionary biologist at UCLA. The calcium-rich water and riverbed of the San Pedro has buttressed the survival of these red mangroves&nbsp;over the years, Zapata says.</p>

<p>In addition to the mangroves, the team found various plant species in the inland area that also have a coastal heritage. More than 30 percent, or 112 species, of the total flora growing along the river, including orchids and legumes, are typically found in coastal lagoons or along shorelines, the researchers say.</p>



<p>With those findings in hand, the researchers decided to look at the soil too. The team expected to find “coastal sediments, ocean sediments and perhaps ocean fossils,” says Exequiel Ezcurra, an ecologist at the University of California, Riverside. A geologic survey of sediments near the mangroves revealed “exactly what we expected,” he says, including coastal gravels, shells of marine gastropods, clay sediments rich in shell fragments, coastal dunes and large oyster shells.</p>



<p>Those finds, along with simulations of past sea levels, confirm that at some point during the last interglacial period, the ocean must have merged with the lower basin of the San Pedro River, pushing the red mangroves and other coastal species inland, the researchers conclude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discovering this relict ecosystem highlights the widespread impact past changes in the climate have had on the world’s coastlines, Ezcurra says, and it provides a chance to better understand how future sea level rise may affect these ecosystems.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Research into first impressions is a well-established area. Hundreds of studies have been published with the goal of understanding how the subtleties of facial features cue assumptions about those we meet. Often, the stimuli used are tightly controlled, with some sets using faces whose features are digitally manipulated to be larger or smaller by tiny degrees; the effect of miniscule alterations to the wideness of eyes, for example, can be isolated and analysed without changing any other aspect of the face. By eliminating as many extraneous variables as possible, research teams hope to get a reading of exactly what specific features contribute to the first impressions we form.</p>



<p>While on the surface this sounds like a reasonable and solid scientific approach, it does tend to create one pressing problem in particular. If you’ve ever participated in or run a study using face stimuli, it’s likely that the faces used were exclusively White.</p>



<p>Authors typically give no explicit reasoning for this choice within their published work. Richard Cook of Birkbeck, University of London and Harriet Over of the University of York believe that there are four broad reasons for this common decision. In their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34567592/">recent paper</a> in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, the two deconstruct the assumptions behind possible reasonings, and examine the limitations imposed on the field by avoiding non-White face stimuli.</p>



<span id="more-44197"></span>



<p><strong>A Confounding Factor?</strong></p>



<p>One of the concerns researchers may have about including non-White faces is that participants will infer traits of face stimuli based on just on ethnicity, regardless of the actual features of the face presented.</p>



<p>While it’s understandable to seek to limit the effects of racial bias when using face stimuli, the authors argue that this particular concern doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. In the lab, slight alterations in facial structure of Black face stimuli have been shown to affect the responses of White participants, suggesting that White viewers can form first impressions of Black faces based on features. Many studies also illustrate that participants do not apply blanket judgements to faces belonging to a particular group. For example, in a policing and judicial context, Black people with facial features that look more “stereotypically Black” (a term used centrally in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01716.x">original 2006 paper</a>) have been found to receive harsher sentencing decisions than those who do not.</p>



<p><strong>The Other-Race Effect</strong></p>



<p>Another concern for many researchers is the fallout of the Other Race Effect, in which some people have issues discerning between faces of those from races different to their own. It is often assumed that participants may lack the necessary perceptual expertise to process these faces, so datasets containing “other race” faces may not produce meaningful results.</p>



<p>However, the authors point out that the Other Race Effect produces relatively mild face processing deficits compared to face processing disorders such as prosopagnosia; even then, people with prosopagnosia nevertheless make judgements of facial traits typical of those without the condition. This concern also fails to consider the diverse environments in which people are raised. In many cities, locals are likely to have grown up with exposure to individuals from a large number of races. And of course, many people have family members of a different race. This leads the authors to believe that the Other Race Effect poses little practical concern, which is a view that seems to be supported by inconsistencies in racial exclusion criteria between many first impression studies — some studies allow non-White participants to assess White face sets, whereas others exclude non-White participants.</p>



<p>In addition, many face stimuli sets are computer generated — at times obviously so. This leads the authors of this paper to pose the question: “Given that synthetic faces with which participants have little or no perceptual experience can be valuable stimuli, then why not faces of colour?”</p>



<p><strong>Overshadowing Subtle Effects</strong></p>



<p>When inserting non-White faces into sets of White faces, it is possible that race would become a very salient factor, and so researchers may be concerned that participants will attend to race above all else, ignoring subtle changes in features.</p>



<p>The authors of this paper, however, argue that this is not necessarily something to shy away from. To the contrary, they assert that this is a key part of what the field of first impressions seeks to understand. Perceived ethnicity is an influential social cue — if we accept that first impressions based on ethnicity is quantitatively similar to other types of first impression (eg. based on sex or age), then it makes sense that this is a variable that we should seek to investigate, rather than exclude. Many studies already use interleaved male and female faces, and if ethnicity exerts a comparable level of effect, the authors emphasise there should also be few issues with interleaving diverse faces in research studies.</p>



<p>If studies require the ethnicity of face stimuli to be controlled, the authors suggest that this can also be achieved while including non-White faces. For example, all Black or all Asian face stimuli sets would be as effective at removing the influence of race as an all-White set.</p>



<p><strong>The Logistics of Using Diverse Face Stimuli</strong></p>



<p>In years gone by there were relatively few diverse face stimuli sets for researchers to choose from. Due to the effort involved in creating new stimuli sets, researchers looking to include non-White faces were faced with the prospect of spending hours perfecting their own set. For many, the impracticality was too much, and the readily available all-White sets were often chosen.</p>



<p>This, however, is changing. These days, there are several readily available diverse face sets, and the authors also note that computer generated sets allow for non-White faces to be generated. Even so, it appears that this option is rarely used within research — likely for the reasons discussed above. With these concerns addressed, however, hopefully that feature will see more use.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In recent years, psychologists have increasingly recognised the problems of studying only people from WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) backgrounds. Broadening stimuli to more resemble the real world, including widening investigations to assess first impressions across all races, is an important piece of this puzzle. Beyond being just a tick-box exercise, there is the potential to unearth findings that have substantial real-world impact; for example, understanding the types of faces that receive the harshest first impressions could help combat bias in everything from university applications to court judgements. And, though this paper focuses on research into first impressions, this isn’t the only topic that uses face stimuli. There are many other areas of psychology that make use of face stimuli whose validity may be hindered by not using stimuli sets that reflect the diversity of the real world. Without diverse data, we can’t know for sure.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we are beginning to see progress on this issue, and there have been some promising steps in the right direction in recent years. For instance, there have been replication attempts of studies focusing on dominance and trustworthiness in facial features, re-run with stimuli comprising equal numbers of Black, White, Asian, and Latin faces. Going forward, the authors believe that this amount of diversity should be routinely used. And, where researchers do not include diverse stimuli, explicit statements of reasoning behind this would be useful.</p>



<p>Perhaps most centrally to this argument, it is important that research into faces move past this so as not to imply that White is the default. In generations before us, this was very much the commonly held view. But in 2021, we are moving beyond that, and our stimuli need to make that journey too.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34567592/">Why is the literature on first impressions so focused on White faces?</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-lidar-mexican-pyramid-maya-teotihuacan-temple-feathered-serpent-tikal">Lasers reveal construction inspired by ancient Mexican pyramids in Maya ruins</a></h4>

              
                <p>At Teotihuacan, near Mexico City, three giant pyramids rise above the ancient city’s main street, the Avenue of the Dead. The smallest of these is the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, which sits within La Ciudadela, or the Citadel, a massive sunken plaza with tall walls.</p>



<p>Now, more than a thousand kilometers away at the Maya capital of Tikal in what’s now Guatemala, researchers have found a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/teotihuacan-complex-at-the-classic-maya-city-of-tikal-guatemala/1ABD72745DB20D55493B1A47CF267E77">smaller plaza and pyramid</a> possibly modeled after La Ciudadela and its temple.</p>



<p>Teotihuacan is thought to have conquered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">Tikal in the year 378</a> (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>)<em>.</em> The finding adds to evidence of Teotihuacan’s influence over Tikal, the team reports September 28 in <em>Antiquity.</em></p>



<p>“The architectural layout revealed by this study is stunning,” says anthropological archaeologist Nawa Sugiyama of the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new research. “The very orthogonal city planning with specific orientation of the pyramids gives Teotihuacan a very characteristic architectural style, making it easy to identify any Teotihuacan influence abroad.”</p>





<p>What’s more, the newfound structures had six construction phases, the researchers say, most dating to a time in Mesoamerica that archaeologists call the Early Classic period, which lasted from about 300 to 550. That means that the Tikal complex possibly predates the Teotihuacan conquest of the Maya city in 378. If true, that would add more evidence to an idea that scientists have worked on for decades — that these civilizations were in contact much earlier than the conquest of Tikal, possibly trading and making political connections with one another.</p>



<p>To uncover the pre-Columbian architecture, archaeologist Stephen Houston of Brown University in Providence, R.I., and colleagues at the Proyecto Arqueológico del Sur de Tikal along with the Pacunam LiDAR Initiative and the University of Texas at Austin used an airborne remote-sensing technique called lidar, or light detection and ranging.</p>

<p>“We knew this area in Guatemala was important to Teotihuacan culture,” says study coauthor David Stuart, director of the Mesoamerica Center of the University of Texas at Austin. But the place where the Citadel-inspired construction is located did not appear on old maps of the Tikal archaeological site because it is covered in vegetation. “As there was no visible stonework there, it was thought to be a natural hill,” Stuart says.</p>



<p>The team decided to look closer because the mound looked unusual for a Maya site. “Since the location was adjacent to an area in Tikal where many Teotihuacan-style artifacts were found in the 1980s, we thought it deserved more attention,” Stuart says. After reviewing the lidar mapping, Houston saw that the general plan of the buildings resembled the Ciudadela and its temple at Teotihuacan.</p>



<p>In her 2004 book <em>The</em> <em>Ancient Maya: New Perspectives</em>, Louisiana State University archaeologist Heather McKillop noted that the abundant presence of Teotihuacan-style architecture and pottery found in Tikal and a number of Maya sites across Guatemala is extensive evidence of the Teotihuacan influence across Mesoamerica from the year 400 to 700. The ancient city in Mexico thrived from about 100 to 750, but much about the people who lived there and why the city was destroyed and abandoned is still a mystery. The Aztecs gave the name Teotihuacanto the city centuries after its collapse.</p>



<p>“It is almost like Teotihuacan had installed their own neighborhood or embassy in Tikal,” says study coauthor and archaeologist Thomas Garrison, also at the University of Texas at Austin. Other research led by Sugiyama shows that “there was also a more permanent Maya presence in Teotihuacan before the conquest of Tikal as well, so influence probably went in both ways.”</p>



<p>Sugiyama studies the <a href="http://ppcteotihuacan.org/en/home/">Plaza of the Columns Complex</a> at Teotihuacan, where researchers have found Maya ceramics and evidence of Maya-style painted walls. “These murals were destroyed … before the 378 arrival event,” she says. “That makes us wonder whether the conquest [of Tikal] was one of the last chapters” in a long history of contact between the Mayas and the Teotihuacanos.</p>



<p>Eduardo Natalino dos Santos, a Mesoamerica historian at the University of São Paulo who did not take part in the study, agrees with Sugiyama. “The circulation of these ancient architectural styles show that the Mesoamerican Indigenous elites were connected. We used to see traces of one culture in a different region always as a result of a colonizing or domination process. Maybe this is not always the case,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskless-elephants-evolution-poaching">Tuskless elephants became common as an evolutionary response to poachers</a></h4>

              
                <p>When ivory poachers target elephants, the hunters can affect more than just animal numbers. In Mozambique, past hunting pressure led to an increase of naturally tuskless elephants in one park, a study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Mozambican Civil War, which lasted from 1977 to 1992, armies hunted elephants and other wildlife for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ecologists-restore-war-wrecked-ecosystem-mozambique">food and ivory</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 5/5/19</em>). This caused the number of large herbivores to drop more than 90 percent in the country’s Gorongosa National Park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, video footage and photographic records show that as elephant numbers plummeted, the proportion of tuskless female African savanna elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) rose from about 18 percent to 51 percent.</p>



<p>Decades of poaching appear to have made <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe7389">tusklessness more advantageous from an evolution standpoint</a> in Gorongosa, encouraging the proliferation of tuskless females with mutations in two tooth genes, researchers report in the Oct. 22 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The rapid culling of tusked individuals changed the makeup of traits in the elephant population in only two decades, leaving behind more tuskless individuals, say evolutionary biologist Shane Campbell-Staton of Princeton University and colleagues. The tuskless trait is heritable, and the evolutionary change in the population may stick around for several generations at least, even as poaching eases.</p>



<p>The team also analyzed the genetic instruction books of 18 tusked and tuskless females, zeroing in on two genes rife with mutations in tuskless females. In humans, the disruption of one of those genes can cause tooth brittleness and the absence of a pair of upper incisors that are the “anatomical equivalent of tusks,” Campbell-Staton says. Abnormalities in the other gene’s protein product can cause malformations of the tooth root and tooth loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poaching “changing the course of evolution” in Gorongosa’s elephants, Campbell-Staton says, can have reverberating effects through the ecosystem given elephants’ dramatic impact on their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Tusks are] not just ornamental. They serve a purpose,” he says, detailing how elephants use tusks to dig for water and strip tree bark for food. “If an elephant doesn&#8217;t have the tool to do those things, then what happens?”</p>

Nests consisted of eight to 30 eggs, and analyses of five nests revealed that in each, the eggs were arranged in two or three layers within shallow trenches. Analyses of some skeletons revealed a diverse array of ages: At least 11 were hatchlings less than a year old, two were adults and nine were juveniles.</p>

<p>Fossils of the first known dinosaurs, including sauropodomorphs — relatively diminutive ancestors of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-largest-dinosaur-discovered">long-necked behemoth sauropods such as <em>Dreadnoughtus schrani</em></a> — date to around 245 million years ago (<em>SN: 9/4/14</em>). By the end of the Triassic Period, about 201 million years ago, sauropodomorphs, including <em>Mussaurus</em>, had become among the most abundant plant eaters on land. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-sauropod-went-walking-four-legs-two-it-grew"><em>Mussaurus</em> roamed</a> in what&#8217;s now Patagonia&#8217;s deserts (<em>SN: 5/20/19</em>). The dinosaurs built the newly unearthed nests when the area was semi-arid, near a&nbsp;lake that may have periodically flooded and evaporated. A sudden flood may explain the dinosaurs’ demise.</p>



<p>Mind-bogglingly massive sauropods didn’t arise until the Jurassic Period, which followed the Triassic. But fossils of Triassic sauropodomorphs like <em>Mussaurus</em> were already showing evidence of a growth spurt. The increased energy demands of larger bodies, the researchers suggest, may have required these creatures to coordinate their efforts, forming herds to forage across long distances.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite much work to counter unequal workforces in science, technology, engineering and maths, stereotypes about who will succeed in science <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">still abound</a> — and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-22579-003">some research</a> suggests that these biases can actively put people off certain careers or fields. Other papers find that the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">competitive nature</a> of STEM courses and roles can be particularly damaging, leading to low feelings of belonging and subsequent low retention rates for minority groups.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211033748">new paper</a> looks at the role of men in countering hostile environments — in particular, how men can signal their support and respect for women colleagues. Over three studies, the University of Kansas team found that supportive male allies helped reduce feelings of isolation and hostility for their women colleagues, potentially offering a new way to combat inequality in STEM.</p>



<span id="more-44163"></span>



<p>In the first study, 241 White women were told to imagine they had recently received a job offer at a chemistry company. Participants were randomly assigned to four conditions: in each, they saw a slideshow of their future co-workers. In two conditions all co-workers were male, while in the other they were gender-balanced. Within those groups, some participants were also assigned to the “ally condition”, in which one of the male co-workers expressed support for gender equality, while in the “no-ally condition”, none of the men mentioned gender equality. After viewing this slideshow, participants indicated how much they felt they would be isolated at the new company and how much they felt their co-workers would support and empower them. </p>



<p>Women without allies in workplaces with unequal gender compositions anticipated feeling significantly more isolation, though for those in gender-balanced contexts the presence of an ally didn’t make a difference to anticipated isolation. Participants in the all-men workforce with no ally also anticipated significantly less support from co-workers compared to those who had either been exposed to an ally or those in a more gender-balanced workforce. Having an ally in an unbalanced workforce, therefore, was as powerful at reducing feelings of isolation as having a gender-balanced group of colleagues.</p>



<p>The second study looked at the impact of allyship specifically on women of colour, with Black and White women participants recruited to take part. The procedure from the first study was employed again — only this time, the randomly assigned allies were either Black or White men, and all participants saw workforces in which women were underrepresented. After viewing the slideshow, participants completed the same measures as before, as well as indicating how much they anticipated hostility in the workplace and how much respect and equality they expected to encounter.</p>



<p>Those who were assigned an ally indicated that they expected to receive more respect and support in the workforce, would be less isolated, and would experience less hostility. There was no difference in results between Black and White women and the race of the male ally was also non-significant, suggesting that allies of all races can have an impact on women’s feelings of safety and inclusion at work. However, all workforces had 50/50 representation in terms of race; this could have mitigated any potential effects of the race of allies.</p>



<p>In a third and final study, participants saw allies who were either men or women. As well as completing the previous measures, participants also indicated how much they felt gender equality was the norm in the new workplace and how much they expected to fit in with their colleagues. Participants with either a male and female ally had significantly higher expectations of respect than those without. Interestingly, however, male allies outflanked female allies in other areas — participants expected gender equality to be the norm when a male ally was present but not a female ally, were more likely to feel they fit in and feel less isolated, and believed they would receive more support. They were also more likely to feel the workplace was not going to be hostile.</p>



<p>Though the results do seem to offer some hope — and a potential strategy for tackling unbalanced and stereotypically &#8220;male&#8221; environments — there are some limitations to the work. Firstly, the study only gave insights into women’s <em>anticipated</em> responses to allies, rather than looking at how it can help women when they are already in a workplace. Furthermore, looking at how allyship affects women in actually hostile environments versus generally gender equal ones could provide more detail on its impact (and its limits). The team also points to sincerity as a potentially mitigating factor — what happens to this gendered effect when men <em>say</em> they are dedicated to gender equality but don’t follow through, or if they exhibit other forms of hostility related to race, class or sexuality?</p>



<p>Despite limitations and lingering questions, however, the study does offer some tangible action that men could (and should) be taking in the workplace. Though such a strategy is obviously unlikely to completely reduce gender inequality, creating supportive, respectful and just working environments could go some way to make STEM a more equal place to be.</p>
