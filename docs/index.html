<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541672420">Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</a><em><br>Thor Hanson<br>Basic Books, $28</em></p>



<p>As a conservation biologist, Thor Hanson has seen firsthand the effects of climate change on plants and animals in the wild: the green macaws of Central America migrating along with their food sources, the brown bears of Alaska fattening up on early-ripening berry crops, the conifers of New England seeking refuge from vanishing habitats. And as an engaging author who has celebrated the wonders of nature in books about feathers, seeds, forests and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-humans-and-big-macs-depend-bees">bees</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/18, p. 28</em>), he’s an ideal guide to a topic that might otherwise send readers down a well of despair.</p>



<p>Hanson does not despair in his latest book, <em>Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</em>. Though he outlines the many ways that global warming is changing life on our planet, his tone is not one of hand-wringing. Instead, Hanson invites the reader into the stories of particular people, places and creatures of all sorts. He draws these tales from his own experiences and those of other scientists, combining reporting with narrative tales of species that serve as examples of broader trends in the natural world.</p>





<p>A trip to La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, for example, has Hanson reliving the experience of tropical ecologist and climatologist Leslie Holdridge, who founded the research station in the 1950s and described, among other things, how climate creates different habitats, or life zones, as elevation increases. As Hanson sweats his way up a tropical mountainside so he can witness a shift in life zones, he notes, “I had to earn every foot of elevation gain the hard way.” I could almost feel the heat that he describes as “a steaming towel draped over my head.” His vivid descriptions bring home the reason why so many species have now been documented moving upslope to cooler climes.</p>



<p>Hanson doesn’t waste much breath trying to convince doubters of the reality of climate change, instead showing by example after example how it is already playing out. The book moves quickly from the basic science of climate change to the challenges and opportunities that species face — from shifts in seasonal timing to ocean acidification — and the ways that species are responding.</p>



<p>As Hanson notes, the acronym MAD, for “move, adapt or die,” is often used to describe species’ options for responding. But that pithy phrase doesn’t capture the complexity of the situation. For instance, one of his titular characters, a lizard slammed by back-to-back Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, illustrates a different response. Instead of individual lizards adjusting, or adapting, to increasingly stormy conditions, the species evolved through natural selection. Biologists monitoring the lizards on two islands noticed that after the hurricanes, the lizard populations had longer front legs, shorter back legs and grippier toe pads on average than they had before. An experiment with a leaf blower showed that these traits help the lizards cling to branches better — survival of the fittest in action.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcomes for species will probably be as varied as their circumstances. Some organisms have already moved, adapted or died as a result of the warming, and many more will face challenges from changes that are yet to come. But Hanson hasn’t given up hope. When it comes to preventing the worst-case scenarios, he quotes ecologist Gordon Orians, who is in the seventh decade of a career witnessing environmental change. When asked what a concerned citizen should do to combat climate change, he responded succinctly: “Everything you can.” And as Hanson points out, this is exactly how plants and animals are responding to climate change: by doing everything they can. The challenge feels overwhelming, and as a single concerned citizen, much feels out of my hands. Yet Hanson’s words did inspire me to take a cue from the rest of the species on this warming world to do what I can.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates&#8230; if you’re looking for motivation or personal inspiration, it’s likely that you’ll see quotes from rich, prominent people. At the same time, there seems to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/20/new-wealth-tax-uk-arguments">growing</a> <a href="https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/EP2_PublicAttitudes.pdf">discontent</a> with the levels of inequality in the world — a discontent seemingly at odds with the worship of wealthy people we see in the media and online.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, explores this disconnect. It finds that even as we see the wealth of billionaires as a <em>group</em> as unfair, we remain tolerant of the achievements and wealth of individuals. And this also has an impact on the policies and positions people are willing to support.</p>



<span id="more-44745"></span>



<p>An initial study explored how much executives should make, with participants reading either about the recent increase in the salaries of CEOs from the largest companies in America, or about the increase of one specific CEO. Those who read about individual CEOs thought their salaries should be significantly higher than those who read about CEOs as a group. A second study replicated these findings in the context of sport, where high-financed individual players were seen as having less of an unfair advantage over low-financed players than high-financed <em>teams</em> over low-financed teams.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants read two passages, one about a conglomerate and one about an individual. In both pieces of writing, the conglomerate or individual were in a competition to win a government contract; because of their wealth, they were able to spend more than their rivals for the contract, which they eventually won. Again, participants felt that the competition between individuals was more fair, both in terms of outcome and in terms of the resource distribution between competitors.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were told either the average wealth of the 25 wealthiest people in America or about the wealth accrued by one of the wealthiest individuals. No information was given about their identity or the way they became rich. Participants then wrote about why they thought the individual or group had become rich, the factors they felt were responsible, and how fair they thought it was. Finally, they rated their support for a wealth tax.</p>



<p>Participants who read about individuals had a stronger belief that wealth was down to personal characteristics, and also believed it had been obtained more fairly than those who read about the group. Those who read about the group were also marginally more in favour of a wealth tax, suggesting again that we feel more sympathetic towards rich individuals than groups.</p>



<p>The final study looked at the impact of the media. Half of the participants saw a cover from Forbes magazine highlighting seven of the wealthiest people in the world. The other half of participants saw a cover with just one of the seven billionaires.</p>



<p>After viewing the cover, participants were then asked to write about how they felt about the person or people depicted, how much they thought they deserved their wealth, how fair it was, and how much their success was due to talents and abilities versus an unequal and unfair economic system. Finally, participants rated how much they supported an inheritance tax to close the inequality gap.</p>



<p>Those in the individual condition wrote less angry responses about how they felt than those in the group condition, and were more likely to chalk success up to talent than any unfair advantage. Those who saw the group of billionaires were also more likely to back an inheritance tax than those who saw individuals.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first study to find a difference in attitudes between individuals and groups — other <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/11/were-more-likely-to-steal-from-large-groups-than-from-individuals/">research</a> published this year found that we’re also more likely to steal from large groups than we are from individuals, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/14/people-love-winning-streaks-by-individuals-more-than-those-by-teams/">another study</a> found that we prefer individual to team winning streaks. So why is this the case? The team suggests that we are better able to stereotype groups — so when confronted with a particular individual, the traits of theirs that don’t align with these stereotypes lead us to see them as less prototypical of the group and thus more sympathetic. And if we think negatively about “the 1%”, the individuals we bring to mind will be especially negative, making those less egregious individuals seem better in comparison.</p>



<p>&#8220;How we express and communicate information about inequality is important,” <a href="https://news.osu.edu/people-love-the-billionaire-but-hate-the-billionaires-club/">said</a> co-author Jesse Walker. “Talking about ‘the 1%’ is going to get a different reaction than personalizing it by talking about one person in that exclusive club.&#8221; Rethinking how we talk about inequality, showing the negative impact of individual as well as collective wealth, may help shift attitudes.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">People are more tolerant of inequality when it is expressed in terms of individuals rather than groups at the top</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-microplastics-skeletons">Corals may store a surprising amount of microplastics in their skeletons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprising amount of plastic pollution in the ocean may wind up in a previously overlooked spot: the skeletons of living corals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up to about 20,000 metric tons of tiny fragments called microplastics may be stored in coral skeletons worldwide every year, says ecologist Jessica Reichert of Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany. That corresponds to nearly 3 percent of the microplastics estimated to be in the shallow, tropical waters where corals thrive.</p>



<p>Corals <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/corals-dine-microplastics">have been observed eating</a> or otherwise <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0726">incorporating</a> microplastics into their bodies (<em>SNS: 3/18/15</em>). But scientists don’t know how much of the debris reefs take up globally. So Reichert and colleagues exposed corals in the lab to microplastics to find out where the particles are stored inside corals and estimate how much is tucked away.</p>



<p>Corals consumed some of the trash, or grew their skeletons over particles. After 18 months, most of the debris inside corals was in their skeletons rather than tissues, the researchers report October 28 in <em>Global Change Biology</em>. After counting the number of trapped particles, the researchers estimate that between <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15920">nearly 6 billion and 7 quadrillion microplastic particles may be permanently stored in corals</a> worldwide annually.</p>

Reichert</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s the first time that a living microplastic “sink,” or long-term storage site, has been quantified, Reichert says.</p>



<p>Scientists are learning how much microplastic is being introduced to the oceans. But researchers don&#8217;t know <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">where it all ends up</a> (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). Other known microplastic sinks, such as sea ice and seafloor sediments, need better quantification, and other sinks may not yet be known.</p>



<p>Reefs are typically found near coasts where polluted waterways can drain to the sea, placing corals in potential microplastic hot spots.</p>



<p>“We don’t know what consequences this [storage] might have for the coral organisms, [or for] reef stability and integrity,” Reichert says. It “might pose an additional threat to coral reefs worldwide.” &nbsp;</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Tyson Bottenus once captained an 80-foot schooner called the <em>Aquidneck</em>. He sailed tourists off the coast of Newport, R.I., discussing the area’s history and sites. In January 2018, he had finished another season at the schooner’s helm and had recently gotten engaged to his partner of many years, Liza Burkin. To celebrate, the couple, avid cyclists who’ve ridden through New Zealand and Japan, set off for a bike tour of Costa Rica.</p>



<p>“We were on this very, very dusty road for a long time,” Bottenus remembers of a ride to Montezuma on the Nicoya Peninsula. “It was a dirty, sandy, hard-packed road.” While going downhill, Bottenus crashed, badly scraping his elbow. The next morning, a doctor spent about an hour picking out little rocks and cleaning dirt from the wound before she bandaged it up. The injury kept him from swimming but otherwise didn’t disrupt the trip.</p>



<p>About a month after returning to Rhode Island, Bottenus started having headaches. He couldn’t control his mouth properly — his speech was off, and he was drooling. Eventually his doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed a lesion in his brain. “My first thought was, I must have some sort of cancer,” he says. “I’m only 31…. I’m way too young for this.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t cancer. Nor was it any of the infections proposed as doctors searched for a diagnosis. Two brain biopsies didn’t provide enough tissue to identify the problem.</p>



<p>In August 2018, Bottenus became very ill and was hospitalized. He couldn’t walk. His mouth muscles weren’t working. And he could no longer tie the drawstring of his pants with a square knot, a common knot sailors use to fasten two ropes together. It’s a knot Bottenus has taught others and could previously do with his eyes closed. “I’m a captain of boats, supposedly,” he remembers thinking. “I am not the person I think I am.”</p>



<p>Finally, a third brain biopsy, taking a slightly larger amount of tissue, yielded a diagnosis: Bottenus had a fungus growing in his brain. It was a black mold called <em>Cladophialophora bantiana </em>that can breach the blood-brain barrier. The best medical guess is that Bottenus was exposed in Costa Rica — probably from the dusty air he inhaled, or maybe from the debris-laden wound on his elbow.</p>



<p>People are exposed to fungi all the time, and usually we get along just fine. Fungi are in the air, in the soil and in us, part of the community of microbes that live in our bodies. Fungi that inhabit plant roots form crucial partnerships with more than 90 percent of land plant species, helping the plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil in exchange for food. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007964">some fungi are also infectious pathogens</a> that can cause pneumonia, blindness and meningitis.</p>

<h3>Emerging threats</h3>



<p>An estimated <a href="https://gaffi.org/why/">2 million people globally die from fungal diseases</a> each year. And pathogenic fungi tend to harm those with the least means. Fungal keratitis, an infection of the cornea, strikes more than a million people annually, estimates suggest, and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30448-5/fulltext">blinds around 600,000</a>. Found in tropical and subtropical areas, the disease — usually treatable when diagnosed early — often impacts young, poor agricultural workers. Another example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7440622/">chronic pulmonary aspergillosis</a>, is a lung infection that commonly occurs in people already burdened with lung damage from tuberculosis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30303-1/fulltext">Fungal infections are also a threat to people with HIV</a>, a virus that weakens the immune system. When defenses are down, typically benign fungi can take advantage of the gaps in our immunological armor and cause an infection. In resource-rich areas, fungal infections have decreased with earlier HIV diagnosis and the availability of antiretroviral drugs. But in places where people can’t get early, consistent HIV care, fungal infections have stubbornly persisted as dangerous complications of HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>Advances in modern medicine that have extended lives have also led to more fungal infections. Organ transplantation and treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases have created a large population of people who regularly take drugs that inhibit components of the immune system, leaving these patients susceptible to fungal invaders.</p>



<p>Some fungi have emerged as recent threats to human health. First <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161556/">reported in Japan in 2009 as the cause of an ear infection</a>, a yeast called <em>Candida auris </em>unexpectedly caused outbreaks of invasive infections — those that reach the blood, spinal fluid or other typically sterile areas of the body — on three continents a few years later. Hospital patients are especially at risk from the yeast, which is resistant to certain antifungal drugs.</p>



<p>Scientists have proposed that the emergence of <em>C. auris</em> as a danger to people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans">may be tied to our warming climate</a>, with the yeast gaining temperature tolerance in the environment. That could explain why <em>C. auris</em> can replicate inside human bodies, a niche that’s usually too hot for many fungi.</p>



<p>The warming climate may make other fungal pathogens more widespread. <em>Coccidioides</em>, a fungus that shape-shifts from a soil-dwelling, fluffy mold to aerosolized spores to round, parasitic cells at the site of infection, causes a disease called valley fever. Someone who breathes in the spores might not have symptoms at all or could become fatigued, short of breath and develop a fever, cough and night sweats. It’s among the fungal pathogens that can strike healthy immune systems. In the United States in 2019, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/statistics.html">18,407 cases</a> were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p><em>Coccidioides</em> is primarily found in southwestern states, but global warming could change that. “The entire western United States has been identified as potential habitat,” says medical mycologist Bridget Marie Barker of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The fungi thrive in hot, dry environments where there are brief, heavy rains. Climate change is expected to make western states hotter and alter precipitation patterns. Research reported in <em>GeoHealth</em> in 2019 predicts that by 2100, the areas impacted by <em>Coccidioides</em> could expand north in the western half of the country and annual <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GH000209">cases could increase by 50 percent</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>One fungus’ spread&nbsp;</h4>



<p>By the end of the century, global warming could expand the habitat of the fungus that causes valley fever. These maps show the predicted increase in the incidence of the disease, which today is found mainly in the southwestern United States. Symptoms include fever, fatigue and cough.</p>

<h3>Treatment pitfalls</h3>



<p>Despite the heavy burden of fungal diseases and the potential for that burden to grow, there are no approved vaccines against fungi, and the medicine cabinet of fungal remedies is not deep. There are only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996373/">a few types of antifungal drugs</a>. It’s difficult to develop antifungals in part because fungi are eukaryotes. Like us, and unlike bacteria, their cells have distinct, membrane-bound compartments, including a nucleus that holds their genetic material. That shared biology means that if a drug can kill fungi, it might harm us too.</p>



<p>The antifungals that do exist “are not spectacular,” says pediatric infectious disease physician and medical mycologist Damian Krysan of the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City. Even with treatment, invasive fungal infections are difficult to survive. For example, an invasive infection with the mold <em>Aspergillus</em> has a mortality rate ranging from 40 to 90 percent in patients with weakened immune systems, depending on where the infection is, among other factors. For a cancer patient with a great prognosis who develops an <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, Krysan says, “you can be cured of your cancer and die of your fungal infection.”</p>



<p>Even diagnosing a fungal infection is challenging. For one, there are fewer diagnostic tests specific to fungi than there are for viruses and bacteria. Another problem is that the symptoms of a fungal infection can resemble those caused by other pathogens. And fungi grow slowly, so it takes longer to confirm that a blood or tissue sample is infected with a fungus. A delayed diagnosis can mean delayed treatment, which complicates the chances of recovery.</p>



<p>Into this uncertain medical terrain landed Bottenus, a previously healthy young man who acquired an exceedingly rare fungal infection in his brain.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="340" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-340x450.jpg" alt="black and white brain scan" class="wp-image-3106096" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-340x450.jpg 340w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-289x383.jpg 289w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-141x186.jpg 141w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-438x580.jpg 438w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-586x776.jpg 586w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3106096">This 2018 image of Tyson Bottenus’ brain shows a lesion (white spot) that was later diagnosed as an infection with a fungus called&nbsp;<em>Cladophialophora bantiana</em>.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3106096">Courtesy of T. Bottenus</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Uncharted waters</h3>



<p>Bottenus has been treated with antifungal drugs and steroids. It’s been a “vicious cycle,” says Robbie Goldstein, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who has been part of Bottenus’ team of doctors. The steroids reduce the inflammation from the infection, which puts dangerous pressure on Bottenus’ brain. But the steroids also suppress his immune system, impairing his ability to clear the fungus. When doctors have tried to taper the steroids, the inflammation in Bottenus’ brain has gotten worse.</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic began, Bottenus became nervous that being immunocompromised put him at greater risk of getting sick from the coronavirus. So he stopped taking the steroids. The resulting inflammation triggered a stroke at the end of March 2020. In the several weeks he spent in the hospital, pandemic restrictions prevented Burkin from visiting.</p>



<p>Bottenus is still coping with the effects of the brain infection and the stroke. He has lost most of his peripheral vision. His speech is altered. Navigation is a struggle — he has a hard time finding his way around, even in his home. Bottenus kept telling himself that he’d wake up one day and be back to where he used to be. “But of course that’s a fantasy,” he says.</p>



<p>Yet other brain functions don’t seem to have been harmed. Bottenus began graduate school in the fall of 2020 and has done well in his classes. “He can’t really bike across our neighborhood by himself,” Burkin says, “but he can write a 20-page research paper.”</p>



<p>The whole experience has changed Bottenus’ personality, Burkin says. Her adventurous partner has become reliant on structure and routine. “I think that’s really normal for people who’ve gone through a life-threatening disease, where you have no control,” she says. Bottenus says, living “is as much adventure as I can get.”</p>



<p>In the published cases of <em>C. bantiana</em> infections, the death rate can be as high as 70 percent. Many times, the infection isn’t diagnosed until a patient’s autopsy, Goldstein says. For those who live with this infection, he says, the studies “don’t say what that life is like.” Bottenus and Burkin are crossing uncharted medical territory.</p>



<p>For now, Bottenus is a passenger on friends’ boats. When he bikes, he follows Burkin, or they ride a tandem. He makes sure to have his cell phone when he goes out, in case he gets lost. “He used to literally be able to do celestial navigation and lead us on bike tours across continents,” Burkin says. “I don’t know that it is permanent, these changes. I don’t think there’s any way to know.”</p>

<p>But “I can’t blame this fungus,” she says. “We were out on a bike ride and some dirt got into his body.”</p>



<p>Sometimes a doctor meets a patient after they’ve already been seriously harmed by an infection, Goldstein says. But he got to know Bottenus from the beginning, when the young sailor was searching for a diagnosis. Goldstein says this experience has made him really aware, when he’s talking to a patient, of how devastating an infection can be to the life they had before.</p>



<p>“Before there was an infection,” he says, “there was a person.”</p>

<p>Over the last decade, states have enacted a variety of restrictive abortion policies at a rapidly increasing rate. Since 2011, nearly 500 abortion restrictions have been enacted in states around the U. S, increasing the hostility of state environments towards abortion access. According to the Guttmacher Institute, over half of states are hostile to abortion rights, and 58% of women aged 15–44 reside in states considered hostile or very hostile to abortion services, meaning states had four or five (hostile), or six (very hostile) restrictive abortion policies in place. Using a state-level abortion restrictiveness index comprised of 18 restrictive abortion policies, the authors conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining whether race/ethnicity and education level moderated the relationship between the restrictiveness index and individual-level probabilities of preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW). Findings demonstrate that Black individuals at all educational levels and those with fewer years of education disproportionately experienced adverse birth outcomes associated with restrictive abortion policies. Restrictive abortion policies may compound existing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and intersecting racial/ethnic and socioeconomic perinatal and infant health inequities.</p>

<p>Dental caries in adolescents remains a significant public health problem with few oral health promotion interventions aimed at reducing dental caries in secondary school-aged students. Previous oral health and mobile health (mHealth) research has suggested the need for the development of a school-based behaviour change intervention incorporating a digital component. This study aimed to describe the development process of a behaviour change intervention to improve the oral health of students aged 11–16 years attending secondary schools in the UK. A six-step process was used to develop the complex intervention informed by behaviour change theory and involving students, young people, parents and teachers in the process. Here an intervention to improve the oral health of secondary school students through improved tooth brushing was developed based on behaviour change theory and work with young people, parents and school staff.</p>

<p>Excess consumption of alcohol and energy-dense foods are two significant preventable causes of a range of non-communicable diseases globally, including heart disease and many cancers. Interventions that involve changing cues in the immediate physical environments that influence consumption could contribute to reducing excess food and alcohol consumption altering the size of tableware, plates, glasses, packaging and bottles. There is considerable uncertainty, however, around the potential effects of different sizes and shapes of tableware on how much food and alcohol people self-serve. These studies aimed to estimate the impact of: 1. Plate size and shape on amount of food self-served; and 2. Wine glass and bottle size on amount of wine self-poured. The authors found that smaller tableware (i.e. plates and wine glasses) decreased the amount of food and wine self-served in an initial serving. Studies are therefore warranted that assess initial as well as subsequent servings, and consumption behaviour—including detailed meal microstructure behaviours.</p>

<p>Over 45 jurisdictions globally have implemented sweetened beverage taxes. Researchers and policymakers need to assess whether and how these taxes change beverage demand and supply, their intended and unanticipated health, economic and equity impacts. Lessons from such evaluations can maximise the policies’ success and impact on non-communicable disease prevention globally. There is ample evidence showing that consumption of sweetened beverages is strongly and positively associated with the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, as well as all-cause mortality. In this article, rather than provide a review of the findings of existing evaluations, the authors ask: what are the lessons we can learn from sweetened beverage tax evaluations?</p>

<p>Following periods of acute ill-health and injury, older people are frequently assessed and provided with rehabilitation services. Healthcare practitioners are required to make nuanced decisions about which patients are likely to benefit from and respond to rehabilitation. The clinical currency in which these decisions are transacted is through the term “rehabilitation potential”. The aim of this study was to explore information about rehabilitation potential in older people to inform the development of an evidence-based assessment tool. 13,484 papers were identified and 49 included in the review. Current approaches to rehabilitation potential provide a snapshot of an individual’s abilities and conditions which fail to capture the dynamic nature and fluctuations associated with frailty and rehabilitation. New approaches to measures abilities over time are required which allow for the prognostication of outcomes and potential benefits of rehabilitation interventions for older people living with frailty.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Research into the use of deep brain stimulation to treat depression has produced mixed results. </strong>But there may promise in a more personalised approach to treatment. At <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/next-generation-deep-brain-stimulation-aims-tackle-depression">Kelly Servick reports</a> on studies using imaging and electrode recordings from individuals to figure out exactly which region to stimulate — and when — for the optimal response.</p>

<p><strong>According to a recent study, psychologists are pretty good at updating their beliefs about an apparently established scientific finding, after reading about a failed replication attempt. </strong>This was even true of scientists who had a personal interest in the outcome of the replication, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/are-scientists-less-prone-to-motivated-reasoning/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica.</em> Of course, this might come as a surprise given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/22/introductory-psychology-books-accused-of-spreading-myths-and-left-leaning-bias/">continued persistence</a> of questionable findings in introductory psychology textbooks — and as Timmer writes, there are some big caveats to the results.</p>

<p><strong>As more and more children become eligible to receive COVID vaccines, how do we make sure that their parents don’t fall for anti-vax conspiracy theories?</strong> People are more likely to subscribe to such beliefs if they overestimate how common they are among other parents, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-dissuade-parents-from-believing-in-anti-vaxxer-conspiracy-theories-171781">explain Darel Cookson and colleagues</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. Their work shows that correcting these misperceptions can make parents more likely to vaccinate their children.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/how-research-abstracts-succeed-and-fail/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Frustrated-person-on-laptop-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>The abstract of a research article has a simple remit: to faithfully summarize the reported research. After the title, it’s the most read section of the article. It’s freely available on the publisher’s website and in online databases. Crucially, it makes the case to the reader for reading the article in full.&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, not all abstracts succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some take the notion of abstraction to extremes.&nbsp;This example is from a physics article:</p><blockquote><p>Unitarity and geometrical effects are discussed for photon-photon scattering.</p></blockquote><p>It has just ten words. Fortunately, most abstracts say rather more, though it’s possible to say too much. The next example, from a geology article, has over 370 words. It starts:</p><blockquote><p>Diagenesis of the Holocene-Pleistocene volcanogenic sediments of the Mexican Basin produced, in strata of gravel and sand, 1H<sub>2</sub>O- and 2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite, kaolinite, R3-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R1-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R3-kaolinite (0.75)-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite and R1-1H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite.

Yet without it, the rest of the text is difficult to appreciate. Similar problems can occur with abbreviations explained only in the article.</p><p>Some abstracts confuse their remit by summarizing the paper rather than its content. The shift to meta-reporting can lead to uninformative boiler-plate text. This example is from a medical education article:</p><blockquote><p>Implications of these results are discussed.</p></blockquote><p>It’s uninformative because readers already know that most research articles contain a discussion section where, by definition, results and their implications are discussed.</p><p>Some abstracts expand their remit to include&nbsp;personal research plans.

This example is from a finance article:</p><blockquote><p>We believe this study will benefit academics, regulators, policymakers and investors.</p></blockquote><p>The problem is that the reader may not see these pronouncements as truly impartial, with the result that the authority of the article is weakened, not strengthened.</p><p>Abstracts can of course fail in many other ways, for example, omitting caveats,&nbsp;adding new information, exaggerating certainty, or providing no more than an advertisement, a piece of puffery.</p><h2>How to write a successful abstract</h2><p>In the light of all this, what should go into a successful abstract? Some&nbsp;clinical journals settle the matter by imposing a structured format. But most journal and conference proceedings don’t and may offer little or no detailed guidance to the author, who may be left confused about what’s needed.</p><p>One starting point is to think of the abstract not as a condensed version of the paper that preserves the original structure and proportions, but as a mini- or micro-paper in its own right, with certain basic elements:</p><ul><li>the context or scope of the work</li><li>the research question or other reason for the work, if relevant</li><li>the approach or methods</li><li>a key result or two</li><li>a conclusion, if appropriate, or other implications of the work.</li></ul><p>Naturally the weight given to each element depends on the research—whether it’s experimental, observational, or theoretical, and whether the expected audience is general or specialized. How much to write about each element is then a balance between including detail and retaining the reader’s interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Within those constraints, it’s important to identify any critical assumptions, non-standard methods, and limitations on the findings so that the scope and potential application of the research is clear. The reader shouldn’t discover on reading the article that the abstract was misleading.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of a well-written abstract from a neuroscience <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1126/science.280.5364.747">article</a>: </p><blockquote><p>An unresolved question in neuroscience and psychology is how the brain monitors performance to regulate behavior. It has been proposed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), on the medial surface of the frontal lobe, contributes to performance monitoring by detecting errors. In this study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine ACC function. Results confirm that this region shows activity during erroneous responses. However, activity was also observed in the same region during correct responses under conditions of increased response competition. This suggests that the ACC detects conditions under which errors are likely to occur rather than errors themselves.</p><cite><em>From C. S. Carter et al., Science 1998, 280, 747-749.

According to Elsevier’s Scopus database, the article has been cited over 2,500 times.</p><p>Encapsulating a body of research so effectively usually takes repeated rewriting. The timing, though, can be a challenge, since the abstract is often prepared last, when the main sections of the paper have found a settled form. It then risks being rushed while material is assembled for submission for publication.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these pressures, the abstract needs as much attention as any other section of the paper. After all, if it doesn’t do its job, the reader may turn to other abstracts that do. And the published article may languish unretrieved and unseen, waiting in vain for the recognition it deserves.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/673711012/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/673711012/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f11%2fFrustrated-person-on-laptop-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/why-depth-interviewing-is-essential-to-understanding-individuals-and-institutions/">Why depth interviewing is essential to understanding individuals and institutions</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/how-oup-is-innovating-for-the-future-of-open-research/">How OUP is innovating for the future of open research</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/police-free-schools-the-new-frontier-in-ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline/">Police-free schools: the new frontier in ending the school-to-prison pipeline</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Sometimes, our emotions are one-dimensional. This morning, for example, when both my kids and my dog jumped into bed, I felt happy. During the Halloween party that my husband and I organised for our boys, though, happiness at their pleasure was definitely tinged with anxiety/stress at managing a houseful of rampaging kids. And here we get into murkier emotional territory. While so much research has been done on individual, &#8220;basic&#8221; emotions, more complex emotional experiences have been neglected. But recent studies have revealed some surprising and special roles for mixed emotions in our lives.</p>



<span id="more-44704"></span>



<p><strong>What<em> do</em> we feel?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073916639661">One of the most impressive explorations of our everyday feeling experiences</a> was published in 2017 in <em>Emotion Review</em>. The US participants wore a beeper that sounded at random moments. Whenever it went off, they jotted down what, if anything, had just been present in their inner experience. Christopher Heavey at the University of Nevada and colleagues found that most of the time, the participants weren’t <em>feeling</em> anything in particular. When they were, it was usually a single feeling — such as happiness or anxiety. But they did sometimes report experiencing multiple distinct feelings simultaneously, which could involve a negative plus a positive emotion. Sometimes, they also reported single, &#8220;blended&#8221;, feelings with both positive and negative facets — a &#8220;sad kind of happiness&#8221;, for example. Of course we already have a term for this: poignancy. But new studies are revealing other emotion combinations.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The curious case of threat-awe&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>This is the title of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">new paper in </a><em><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">Emotion</a> </em>from researchers at the University of New South Wales. &#8220;Curious&#8221;, because although <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/15/feeling-awe-can-sometimes-be-awful/">&#8220;threatening awe&#8221;</a> at the sight of an approaching thunderstorm, say, has been viewed as a negative, fearful sub-aspect of awe, this is not what the team found.</p>



<p>Awe and fear are well-defined, both in terms of how they feel and the kinds of thoughts and behaviours associated with them. Srinwanti Chaudhury and colleagues found that threat-awe has some fear-related aspects and some awe-related aspects, and an overall feeling/behaviours profile that differentiates it from either. So, for example, people experiencing threat-awe were, like people feeling fear, less willing to take risks than those feeling straight awe, but threat-awe felt significantly more pleasant than fear. When participants were simply asked to indicate on a matrix what threat-awe felt like, they reported both negative <em>and</em> positive feelings. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to empirically demonstrate that threat-awe should be regarded as a mixed emotion rather than a negative variant of awe,” the team concludes. They also speculate about the function of threat-awe. Perhaps, they write, it helps us to see &#8220;beauty in adversity&#8221;, which might build resilience in the face of stressful or even traumatic situations.</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions and meaning in life</strong></p>



<p>Hedonistic wellbeing — often called happiness — involves feeling plenty of positive emotions, such as joy and excitement. But <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-017-9849-y">work led by Raul Berrios at the University of Santiago in Chile</a> suggests that mixed positive/negative emotions contribute to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/14/weve-neglected-the-role-of-psychological-richness-when-considering-what-makes-a-good-life-study-argues/">psychological wellbeing.</a> However, they boost not happiness but eudaimonia — the important feeling that one’s life has meaning. The team ran two studies to explore this. One surveyed participants who recalled a recent challenge to their life goals or values. In the other, students watched a video about graduating from university, which focused on the poignancy of this event. Across both studies, participants who then reported feeling stronger mixed emotions also rated their lives as being more meaningful. This work suggests that mixed emotions don’t just help people to cope with stress but have broader impacts on wellbeing. And a 2021 study goes further…</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions make for smarter thinking</strong></p>



<p>Vincent Oh and Eddie Tong at the National University of Singapore <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-021-00045-x">ran four studies</a> on 1,419 people in Singapore and the US during March and April 2020, a peak period for Covid-19 infections and deaths. They report that more frequent mixed emotions — but not levels of positive or negative emotions — were linked to greater eudaimonic wellbeing and also more self-reported infection-prevention behaviours, such as using hand sanitiser frequently and avoiding sharing food. These findings sit well with some other recent studies suggesting that mixed emotions make it easier for us to integrate information from multiple perspectives, supporting more complex thought, and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Interestingly, relatively high levels of positive or negative emotions predicted &#8220;unsupported and atypical virus-prevention behaviours&#8221;, such as eating more honey, or even using detergent as a mouthwash. This is “consistent with findings that positive emotions may promote gullibility and negative emotions may promote maladaptive coping,” the team writes.</p>



<p>So the next time you feel conflicting emotions, don’t worry — the lesson from all this recent work seems to be: it’s good for you.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental advertising: A question of integrity</strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environmental-advertising-question-integrity"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 27, 1971</p>



<p>A new report published by the Council on Economic Priorities clearly outlines facts showing that much corporate advertising on environmental themes is irrelevant or even deceptive.… A large percentage of the environmental advertising comes from companies that are the worst polluters.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Concerns about “greenwashing,” a term coined in the 1980s to describe the practice of organizations marketing their products as environmentally friendly when they are not, have persisted into the current climate crisis. As more consumers have become environmentally conscious, corporations’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies">greenwashing tactics have evolved</a>. For instance, some energy companies in the United States have claimed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-michael-moore-new-film-gets-wrong-about-renewable-energy">natural gas is a “clean” energy source </a>because the power plants emit less carbon dioxide than coal plants. But natural gas plants can emit large amounts of methane, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">a potent greenhouse gas</a>. In 2022, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission plans to review its “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/02/2021-13724/regulatory-review-schedule">Green Guides</a>,” rules for companies that make environmental claims.</p>

<p>Perfectionism can be a useful trait: striving always to do better, perfectionists may be more likely to thrive <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-019-09484-2">academically</a> or <a href="https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/36886/10/749-3957-1-PB.pdf">accomplish</a> other achievements. But it comes with downsides, too: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/27/perfectionism-as-a-risk-factor-for-suicide-the-most-comprehensive-test-to-date/">links</a> with suicidal ideation, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/22/burnout-is-common-among-psychotherapists-now-a-review-has-identified-the-personal-characteristics-that-increase-the-risk-further/">burnout</a>, and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0000324">reduced engagement</a> at work.</p>



<p>One common critique of perfectionism is that it kills creativity, and it’s this question Jean-Christophe Goulet-Pelletier and team from the University of Ottawa, Ontario, explore <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12530?saml_referrer">in a paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology. </em>They find that shooting for greatness, rather than perfection, can lead to higher creativity and increased openness to experience.</p>



<span id="more-44672"></span>



<p>Participants in the first study were 279 Canadian undergraduate students. After sharing demographic data, they completed measures of perfectionism and excellencism (the striving for excellence, rather than perfection). Participants were shown statements about their goals, with some reflecting perfectionism (“My goal at school is to be exceptionally productive all the time”) and some excellencism (“My goal is to perform very well”), rating how much they agreed with them on a scale from one to seven.</p>



<p>Next, their creativity was tested with a &#8220;divergent thinking&#8221; measure. Participants were asked to come up with as many creative answers as they could to several questions, including “tell us the different ways you could use a newspaper” and “name all the things you can think of that make noise”. Finally, they completed a scale measuring openness to experience, which included questions about imagination, interest in art, emotionality, adventurousness, intellect, and liberalism.</p>



<p>The results revealed that the more participants strove for excellence, the greater originality and openness to experience they showed. In contrast, the more perfectionist participants were, the fewer original ideas they had and the less open to experience they were. This suggests that an element of flexibility not present in perfectionism can improve our creative thinking.</p>



<p>The second study involved 401 participants, again Canadian undergraduates. As in the first experiment, excellencism and perfectionism were measured, along with divergent thinking and openness to experience. General self-efficacy was recorded through agreement or disagreement with statements like &#8220;I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have set for myself&#8221;, while creative self-efficacy and creative personal identity were measured through statements such as &#8220;I trust my creative abilities&#8221; and &#8220;My creativity is important to who I am&#8221;.</p>



<p>Participants also took part in two extra tests. In the first, an association test, participants were given a word and asked to create a chain in which each word can be related to the previous word but not the others. If you started with the word &#8220;summer&#8221;, to use the team’s example, a chain could be &#8220;beach, sand, castle, knight, horse, race&#8221;. The second was a <em>dis</em>sociation task. This takes the format of the association task, but asks participants to create a chain of words completely unrelated from one another (e.g. &#8220;summer, computer, banana, bicycle&#8221;).</p>



<p>Again, excellencism was a strong predictor of openness and originality, with perfectionism predicting lower scores on these measures. Those who strove for excellence also did better on the association and dissociation tasks, while perfectionists performed worse. However, there was no significant difference between excellencists and perfectionists on general self-efficacy, creative self-efficacy, and creative personal identity, suggesting that people may not recognise their creativity is being inhibited by their perfectionism.</p>



<p>Much of the study suggests that striving for perfection can prove less positive than perfectionists would like, with those looking merely for excellence faring better overall. Future research could explore how to swap toxic perfectionism for excellencism — but in the meantime, contemplating <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">how to deal with failure</a>, and how it can even be productive, may be worth some time.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12530?saml_referrer">Is perfectionism a killer of creative thinking? A test of the model of excellencism and perfectionism</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/albatross-bird-divorce-ocean-warm-breeding-climate">Albatrosses divorce more often when ocean waters warm</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to fidelity, birds fit the bill: Over 90 percent of all bird species are monogamous and — mostly — stay faithful, perhaps none more famously than the majestic albatross. Albatross couples rarely separate, sticking with the same breeding partner year after year. But when ocean waters are warmer than average, more of the birds split up, a new study finds.</p>



<p>In years when the water was warmer than usual, the divorce rate — typically less than 4 percent on average — rose to nearly 8 percent among albatrosses in part of the Falkland Islands, researchers report November 24 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. It’s <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">the first evidence that the environment</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">, not just breeding failure,</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112"> affects divorce in wild birds</a>. In fact, the team found that during warmer years, even some females that had bred successfully ditched their partners.<a></a></p>



<p>The result suggests that as the climate changes as a result of human activity, higher instances of divorce in albatrosses and perhaps other socially monogamous animals may be “an overlooked consequence,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albatrosses can live for decades, sometimes spending years out on the ocean searching for food and returning to land only to breed. Pairs that stay together have the benefits of familiarity and improved coordination, which help when raising young. This stability is particularly important in dynamic, marine environments, says Francesco Ventura, a conservation biologist at the University of Lisbon in Portugal.</p>





<p><a></a>But if breeding doesn’t work out, many birds — mostly females — leave their partner and try to find better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/when-birds-divorce">luck elsewhere</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/98</em>). Breeding is more likely to fail in years with more difficult conditions, with knock-on effects on divorce rates the following years. Ventura wanted to find out whether the environment also has a direct impact: changing the rate of divorce regardless of whether the breeding had gone well.</p>



<p>Ventura and his team analyzed data collected from 2004 to 2019 on a large colony of black-browed albatrosses (<em>Thalassarche melanophris</em>) living on New Island in the Falkland Islands. The team recorded nearly 2,900 breeding attempts in 424 females, and tracked bird breakups. Then, accounting for previous breeding success in individual pairs, the researchers checked to see if environmental conditions had any noticeable further impact on pairings.</p>



<p>Breeding failure, especially early on, was still the main factor behind a divorce: Each female lays just a single egg, and those birds whose eggs didn’t hatch were over five times as likely to separate from their partners as those who succeeded, or those whose hatched chicks didn’t survive. In some years, the divorce rate was lower than 1 percent.</p>



<p>Yet this rate increased in line with average water temperatures, reaching a maximum of 7.7 percent in 2017 when waters were the warmest. The team’s calculations revealed that the probability of divorce was correlated with rising temperatures. And surprisingly, females in successful breeding pairs were more likely to be affected by the harsher environment than males or females that either didn’t breed, or failed. When ocean temperatures dropped again in 2018 and 2019, so did divorce rates.</p>



<p>Warmer water means fewer nutrients, so some birds may be fueling up out at sea for longer, delaying their return to the colony or turning up bedraggled and unappealing. If members of pairs return at different times, this <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/separate-vacations-birds-winter-apart-return-sync">can lead to breakups</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/04</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, worse conditions one year might raise stress-related hormones in the birds too, which can affect mate choice. A bird may incorrectly attribute its stress to its partner, rather than the harsher environment, and separate even if hatching was successful, the researchers speculate.</p>



<p>Such misreading between cues and reality could make separation a less-effective behavior, suggests Antica Culina, an evolutionary ecologist at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology in Wageningen who was not involved in the study. If animals divorce for the wrong reason and do worse the following season, that can lead to lower breeding success overall and possibly population decline.</p>



<p>Similar patterns could be found in other socially monogamous animals, including mammals, the researchers suggest. “If you imagine a population with a very low number of breeding pairs &#8230; this might have much more serious repercussions,” Ventura says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you have a partner, how do you think your relationship would fare in the face of a natural disaster? Do you think it would bring you closer — or might the stresses make your relationship worse?</p>



<p>Various studies have explored this, and their conclusions have been mixed. But virtually all have been hampered by a lack of key data: measures of relationship satisfaction actually taken <em>before </em>a disaster (rather than later recalled), to compare with measures of satisfaction afterwards. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211015677">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now plugs this gap. Hannah Williamson at the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report a remarkable study of 231 couples living in Harris County, Texas, using data collected before and after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated the region in August 2017.</p>



<span id="more-44664"></span>



<p>A few years before Harvey struck, the team had enrolled a diverse group of newlyweds for a study of relationship development in the early years. By August 2017, these couples had already individually completed a couples satisfaction survey on three occasions, each about six months apart. The team realised that they had, then, the perfect initial data set for a study of the impact of a natural disaster on couples.</p>



<p>About six, 12 and 18 months after the hurricane, the participants completed the couples satisfaction survey again. They also reported on how badly the hurricane had affected them — whether they’d had to evacuate their home or be rescued, and whether they’d been physically injured, for example. And they reported on levels of chronic stress and social support.</p>



<p>Typically, relationship satisfaction for newlywed couples follows this trajectory: initially, they’re very satisfied, but then both wives and husbands report a gradual and continuous decline over time.</p>



<p>That’s not what these couples experienced.</p>



<p>During the period before the hurricane, yes, they reported a gradual decline (and this was more pronounced for the wives than the husbands). But right after the hurricane, both partners enjoyed a similar leap in relationship satisfaction. This might have been down to going through the disaster together, with a partner who was also a victim, the researchers suggest. Whatever the reason, this longitudinal study certainly suggests that natural disasters tend to bring couples together, rather than drive them apart. But this didn’t last long…</p>



<p>“As the initial impact of the hurricane wore off, so too did the increase in satisfaction,” the team reports. Participants soon reverted to reporting the same rate of gradual decline in satisfaction as before the disaster. As life gradually returned to normal, perhaps previous relationship issues resurfaced, or became trickier to overlook.</p>



<p>There were some interesting extra findings. The size of the satisfaction jump was not related to how badly they were personally affected by Hurricane Harvey, or their levels of chronic stress and social support. But couples who’d reported poorer relationships before the hurricane did tend to report the biggest satisfaction jumps afterwards. However, this might be down to a ceiling effect —&nbsp;the couples who were most satisfied before Harvey struck didn’t have much room for improvement.</p>



<p>There are a few limitations to the work that are worth noting. This study was on newlyweds; perhaps couples who’ve been together for longer wouldn’t have the same experience. Also, the data was of course from one group of US residents living in one location. Still, the group was a close match for the diverse racial and ethnic make-up of people living in poverty in that area, the team notes. And as more disaster-prone regions of the US tend to be home to communities with a similar profile, the researchers argue that they represent a sample of people who are more vulnerable to natural disasters in the US, at least.</p>



<p>Natural disasters — whether hurricanes or wildfires or intense rainfall and flooding — are of course becoming more common, and more severe around the world. For anyone affected, their relationship with their partner is likely to be more important than any other for how they cope. This makes it ever more important to understand what impact disasters have on these relationships.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-milky-way-galaxy-feather-gas-spiral-arms-gangotri-wave">Astronomers have found the Milky Way’s first known ‘feather’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way has a “feather” in its cap.<br><br>A long, thin filament of cold, dense <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac341f">gas extends jauntily from the galactic center, connecting two of the galaxy’s spiral arms</a>, astronomers report November 11 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. This is the first time that such a structure, which looks like the barb of a feather fanning off the central quill, has been spotted in the Milky Way.</p>



<p>The team that discovered our galaxy’s feather named it the Gangotri wave, after the glacier that is the source of India’s longest river, the Ganges. In Hindi and other Indian languages, the Milky Way is called Akasha Ganga, “the river Ganga in the sky,” says astrophysicist Veena V.S. of the University of Cologne in Germany.<br><br>She and colleagues found the Gangotri wave by looking for clouds of cold carbon monoxide gas, which is dense and easy to trace, in data from the <a href="https://www.apex-telescope.org/ns/">APEX telescope</a> in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. The structure stretches 6,000 to 13,000 light-years from the Norma arm of the Milky Way to a minor arm near the galactic center called the 3-kiloparsec arm. So far, all other known gas tendrils in the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-milky-way-could-help-map-galactic-structure">align with the spiral arms</a> (<em>SN: 12/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Gangotri wave has another unusual feature: waviness. The filament appears to wobble up and down like a sine wave over the course of thousands of light-years. Astronomers aren’t sure what could cause that, Veena says.</p>



<p>Other galaxies have gaseous plumage, but when it comes to the Milky Way, “it’s very, very difficult” to map the galaxy’s structure from the inside out, she says. She hopes to find more galactic feathers and other bits of our galaxy’s structure. “One by one, we’ll be able to map the Milky Way.”</p>

                The University of Glasgow is “in discussions to retract” seven papers by a pharmacology researcher who worked there for more than 25 years, after it learned of allegations on PubPeer by pseudonymous whistleblower Clare Francis. The development confirms reporting by Retraction Watch earlier this month.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kamooalewa-moon-space-rock-quasisatellite">A space rock called Kamoʻoalewa may be a piece of the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>The moon’s violent history is written across its face. Over billions of years, space rocks have punched craters into its surface, flinging out debris. Now, for the first time, astronomers may have spotted rubble from one of those ancient smashups out in space. The mysterious object known as Kamoʻoalewa appears to be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00303-7">stray fragment of the moon</a>, researchers report online November 11 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Discovered in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-has-tiny-tagalong-and-no-its-not-moon">Kamoʻoalewa — also known as 2016 HO3</a> — is one of Earth’s five known quasisatellites (<em>SN: 6/24/16</em>). These are rocks that stick fairly close to the planet as they orbit the sun. Little is known about Earth’s space rock entourage because these objects are so small and faint. Kamoʻoalewa, for instance, is about the size of a Ferris wheel and strays between 40 and 100 times as far from Earth as the moon, as its orbit around the sun weaves in and out of Earth’s. That has left astronomers to wonder about the nature of such tagalong rocks.</p>



<p>“An object in a quasisatellite orbit is interesting because it’s very difficult to get into this kind of orbit — it’s not the kind of orbit that an object from the asteroid belt could easily find itself caught in,” says Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at MIT not involved in the new work. Having an orbit nearly identical to Earth’s immediately raises suspicions that an object like Kamoʻoalewa originated in the Earth-moon system, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers used the Large Binocular Telescope and the Lowell Discovery Telescope, in Safford and Happy Jack, Ariz., respectively, to peer at Kamoʻoalewa in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. “The real money is in the infrared,” says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Light at those wavelengths contains important clues about the minerals in rocky bodies, helping distinguish objects such as the moon, asteroids and terrestrial planets.</p>





<p>Kamoʻoalewa reflected more sunlight at longer, or redder, wavelengths. This pattern of light, or spectrum, looked unlike any known near-Earth asteroid, Reddy and colleagues found. But it did look like grains of silicate rock from the moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/back-moon-sample-tests-begin">brought back to Earth</a> by Apollo 14 astronauts (<em>SN: 2/20/71</em>).</p>

<p>Kamoʻoalewa, also known as 2016 HO3, has an orbit (white) that is nearly identical to Earth’s (blue), causing the object to weave around Earth as it circles the sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To me,” Binzel says, “the leading hypothesis is that it’s an ejected fragment from the moon, from a cratering event.”</p>



<p>Martin Connors, who was involved in the discovery of Earth’s first known quasisatellites but did not participate in the new research, also suspects that Kamoʻoalewa is a chip off the old moon. “This is well-founded evidence,” says Connors, a planetary scientist at Athabasca University in Canada. But, he cautions, “that doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>



<p>More detailed observations could help confirm Kamoʻoalewa is made of moon stuff. “If you really wanted to put that nail in the coffin, you’d want to go and visit, or rendezvous with this little quasisatellite and take a lot of up-close observations,” says Daniel Scheeres, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder not involved in the work. “The best would be to get a sample.”</p>



<p>China&#8217;s space agency <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1045.pdf">has announced plans</a> to send a probe to Kamoʻoalewa to scoop up a bit of rock and bring it back to Earth later this decade.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Most research into hallucinations focuses on unimodal hallucinations — hallucinatory experiences that only affect one sensory modality, such as hearing or touch. But for decades there has been evidence that multimodal hallucinations (which affect more than one sense at once) may be quite common. One of the main challenges in investigating them, however, has been capturing and communicating the wide array of features that comprise multimodal experiences.</p>



<p>However, thanks to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00433-8/fulltext">new research</a> in <em>EClinicalMedicine </em>from Katie Melvin and colleagues at the University of Leicester, this may be about to change. To improve our understanding of the feelings and sensations associated with hallucinations, the team gathered a group of participants to create what they dubbed MUSE maps — visual and written representations of what hallucinations feel like throughout (and around) the body. Not only do their findings suggest that most hallucinations seem to have emotional and multisensory components, but their new method offers a more intuitive way to communicate and understand hallucinatory experiences.</p>



<span id="more-44655"></span>



<p>For their study, the team recruited twelve participants who were experiencing hallucinations daily and had been given psychotic-spectrum diagnoses. For one week, these participants kept a visual diary documenting the feelings and modalities associated with their hallucinations.</p>



<p>In the diary entries, participants were encouraged to write and sketch about the details of their hallucinatory experiences. Each day’s diary page contained a tick-box list of modalities that were involved in hallucinations, free text boxes in which to write about the feelings and sensations associated with them, and a body-map to indicate which feelings were experienced in which parts of the body. The participants could use any medium to express the lived experience of their hallucinations, though all ultimately chose to provide their input using pen or pencil. The data gathered from these diaries were collectively referred to as multimodal unusual sensory experience (MUSE) maps. Finally, when the week was over, the participants came into a clinic to further discuss each of their MUSE maps in a 30-minute interview with the primary researcher.</p>



<p>The participants reported a wide range of hallucinatory experiences, such as auditory or gustatory hallucinations, all the way through to disruptions in the feeling of time. All participants shared that they experienced bodily feelings and sensations as co-occurring with hallucinations, and provided detailed schematic illustrations of their experiences on the body map templates provided (several of which are reproduced in the published article). Though some favoured words and arrows pointing to various points of the body, others took a more intuitive and artistic approach, illustrating waves of sensations with lines, sectioned bodies, broken hearts, and literally weighted limbs.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, although hallucinations are typically thought of as unimodal experiences, 10 of the 12 participants in this study shared that many of their experiences were multimodal, regularly crossing emotional and sensory boundaries. Each participant typically experienced recurring sensations in particular areas of their body during hallucinations in different modalities, including feelings of pain, heat, or tension.</p>



<p>Analysis of written responses revealed 106 terms pertaining to feelings during hallucinations. The authors found that these divided into four main groups. All but one participant used <em>emotional language</em>, and most of the emotions were negative (eg. fear, powerlessness), with positive emotions only being reported in the minority of cases. Words pertaining to <em>feelings of knowing</em> were employed by half of the participants, who reported a wide range of feelings from boredom all the way to being alert during hallucinatory experiences. <em>Feelings of reality</em> being affected, such as feeling a presence, paranoia, or disorientation, were reported by almost all participants. Participants also reported <em>bodily feelings</em>, such as tiredness or heaviness.</p>



<p>Taken together, this data clearly illustrates that many hallucinations are in fact multimodal, are commonly associated with bodily sensations, and are often accompanied by unpleasant emotional responses. The exploratory nature of MUSE maps, however, does mean that this approach has some limitations. For example, the team highlights that MUSE maps may miss some pertinent sensations, in part because participants themselves decide which sensations are relevant to report, without too much prompting. Body maps including a back view, as opposed to just the front view used in this study, would also be necessary in future studies. In addition, the low sample size of this research may have failed to capture some aspects of multimodal hallucination experiences, or indeed issues with the MUSE map method. As such, future research looking at expanding the sample size and diversity is needed.</p>



<p>Even so, these findings echo contemporary research into hallucinations which suggests that multimodal experiences are common, if considerably harder to communicate. This extra layer of difficulty may have led to the general assumption that unimodal hallucinations are more prevalent. But, the authors say, tools such as MUSE maps may help to close this gap in understanding. The extent of hallucinatory experiences illustrated by the MUSE maps in this study suggest that clinicians may wish to consider broadening their assumptions on whether hallucinations are likely to be unimodal, and perhaps even consider modifying their clinical environment to be more comfortable for those with disturbances across multiple senses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-atom-light-pauli-exclusion-principle">Scientists finally detected a quantum effect that blocks atoms from scattering light</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cloud of ultracold atoms is like a motel with a neon “no vacancy” sign.</p>



<p>If a guest at the motel wants to switch rooms, they’re out of luck. No vacant rooms means there’s no choice but to stay put. Likewise, in new experiments, atoms boxed in by crowded conditions have no way to switch up their quantum states. That constraint means the atoms don’t scatter light as they normally would, three teams of researchers report in the Nov. 19 <em>Science</em>. Predicted more than three decades ago, this effect has now been seen for the first time.</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, atoms interact readily with light. Shine a beam of light on a cloud of atoms, and they’ll scatter some of that light in all directions. This type of light scattering is a common phenomenon: It happens in Earth’s atmosphere. “We see the sky as blue because of scattered radiation from the sun,” says Yair Margalit, who was part of the team at MIT that performed one of the experiments.</p>



<p>But quantum physics comes to the fore in ultracold, dense atom clouds. “The way they interact with light or scatter light is different,” says physicist Amita Deb of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, a coauthor of another of the studies.</p>





<p>According to a rule called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-exploit-quantum-rule-create-new-pauli-crystal">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, atoms in the experiments can’t take on the same quantum state — namely, they can’t have the same momentum as another atom in the experiment (<em>SN: 5/19/20</em>). If atoms are packed together in a dense cloud and cooled to near absolute zero, they&#8217;ll settle into the lowest-energy quantum states. Those low-energy states will be entirely filled, like a motel with no open rooms.</p>



<p>When an atom scatters light, it gets a kick of momentum, changing its quantum state, as it sends light off in another direction. But if the atom can’t change its state due to the crowded conditions, it won’t scatter the light. The atom cloud becomes more transparent, letting light through instead of scattering it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To observe the effect, Margalit and colleagues beamed light through <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi6153">a cloud of lithium atoms</a>, measuring the amount of light it scattered. Then, the team decreased the temperature to make the atoms fill up the lowest energy states, suppressing the scattering of light. As the temperature dropped, the atoms scattered 37 percent less light, indicating that many atoms were prevented from scattering light. (Some atoms can still scatter light, for example if they get kicked into higher-energy quantum states that are unoccupied.)</p>



<p>In another experiment, physicist Christian Sanner of the research institute JILA in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues studied <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3483">a cloud of ultracold strontium atoms</a>. The researchers measured how much light was scattered at small angles, for which the atoms are jostled less by the light and therefore are even less likely to be able to find an unoccupied quantum state. At lower temperatures, the atoms scattered half as much light as at higher temperatures.</p>



<p>The third experiment, performed by Deb and physicist Niels Kjærgaard, also of the University of Otago, measured a similar scattering drop in an <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3470">ultracold potassium atom cloud</a> and a corresponding increase in how much light was transmitted through the cloud.</p>



<p>Because the Pauli exclusion principle also governs how electrons, protons and neutrons behave, it is responsible for the structure of atoms and matter as we know it. These new results reveal the wide-ranging principle in a new context, says Sanner. “It’s fascinating because it shows a very fundamental principle in nature at work.”</p>



<p>The work also suggests new ways to control light and atoms. “One could imagine a lot of interesting applications,” says theoretical physicist Peter Zoller of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, who was not involved with the research. In particular, light scattering is closely related to a process called spontaneous emission, in which an atom in a high-energy state decays to a lower energy by emitting light. The results suggest that decay could be blocked, increasing the lifetime of the energetic state. Such a technique might be useful for storing quantum information for a lengthier period of time than is normally possible, for example in a quantum computer.</p>



<p>So far, these applications are still theoretical, Zoller says. “How realistic they are is something to be explored in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>There’s a widespread belief that eating cheese before bed can give you weird dreams. </strong>But there’s no evidence that this is true, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211117-does-cheese-really-give-you-vivid-dreams">writes Jessica Brown</a> at <em>BBC Future</em>. The belief may have arisen from the fact that cheese is sometimes eaten as the last course of a meal, and eating late at night can disrupt our sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-projections-2500">How climate change may shape the world in the centuries to come</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s hard to imagine what Earth might look like in 2500. But a collaboration between science and art is offering an unsettling window into how ongoing climate change might transform now-familiar terrain into alien landscapes over the next few centuries.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15871">visualizations</a> — of U.S. Midwestern farms overtaken by subtropical plants, of a dried-up Amazon rainforest, of extreme heat baking the Indian subcontinent — emphasize why researchers need to push climate projections long past the customary benchmark of 2100, environmental social scientist Christopher Lyon and colleagues contend September 24 in <em>Global Change Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Fifty years have passed since the first climate projections, which set that distant target at 2100, says Lyon, of McGill University in Montreal. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">that date isn’t so far off anymore</a>, and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions emitted in the past and present will linger for centuries (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>To visualize what that future world might look like, the researchers considered three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">possible climate trajectories</a> — low, moderate and high emissions as used in past reports by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — and projected changes all the way out to 2500 (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). The team focused particularly on impacts on civilization: heat stress, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changing-climate-could-worsen-foods-nutrition">failing crops</a> and changes in land use and vegetation (<em>SN: 3/13/17</em>).</p>





<p>For all but the lowest-emission scenario, which is roughly in line with limiting global warming to “well under” 2 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">approved by the 2015 Paris Agreement</a>, the average global temperature continues to increase until 2500, the team found (<em>SN: 12/12/15</em>). For the highest-emissions scenario, temperatures increase by about 2.2 degrees C by 2100 and by about 4.6 degrees C by 2500. That results in “major restructuring of the world’s biomes,” the researchers say: loss of most of the Amazon rainforest, poleward shifts in crops and unlivable temperatures in the tropics.</p>



<p>The team then collaborated with James McKay, an artist and science communicator at the University of Leeds in England, to bring the data to life. Based on the study’s projections, McKay created a series of detailed paintings representing different global landscapes now and in 2500.</p>



<p>The team stopped short of trying to speculate on future technologies or cities to keep the paintings based more in realism than science fiction, Lyon says. “But we did want to showcase things people would recognize: drones, robotics, hybrid plants.” In one painting of India in 2500, a person is wearing a sealed suit and helmet, a type of garment that people in some high-heat environments might wear today, he says.</p>



<p>The goal of these images is to help people visualize the future in such a way that it feels more urgent, real and close — and, perhaps, to offer a bit of hope that humans can still adapt. “If we’re changing on a planetary scale, we need to think about this problem as a planetary civilization,” Lyon says. “We wanted to show that, despite the climate people have moved into, people have figured out ways to exist in the climate.”</p>

<h3>2000 vs. 2500</h3>



<p> High greenhouse gas emissions could increase average global temperatures by about 4.6 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times. As a result, extreme heat in India could dramatically alter how humans live in the environment. Farmers and herders, shown in 2000 the painting at left, may require protective clothing such as a cooling suit and helmet to work outdoors by 2500, as shown in the painting at right. </p>

<p>If greenhouse gas emissions remain high, the U.S. Midwest&#8217;s &#8220;breadbasket&#8221; farms, as seen below in 2000 in the painting at left, could be transformed into subtropical agroforestry regions by 2500, researchers say. The region might be dotted with some versions of oil palms and succulents, as envisioned in the painting at right, and rely on water capture and irrigation devices to offset extreme summer heat. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">A new map shows where carbon needs to stay in nature to avoid climate disaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over decades, centuries and millennia, the steady skyward climb of redwoods, the tangled march of mangroves along tropical coasts and the slow submersion of carbon-rich soil in peatlands has locked away billions of tons of carbon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If these natural vaults get busted open, through deforestation or dredging of swamplands, it would take centuries before those redwoods or mangroves could grow back to their former fullness and reclaim all that carbon. Such carbon is “irrecoverable” on the timescale — decades, not centuries — needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and keeping it locked away is crucial.</p>



<p>Now, through a new mapping project, scientists have estimated how much irrecoverable carbon resides in peatlands, mangroves, forests and elsewhere around the globe — and which areas need protection.</p>



<p>The new estimate puts the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00803-6">total amount of irrecoverable carbon at 139 gigatons</a>, researchers report November 18 in <em>Nature Sustainability.</em> That’s equivalent to about 15 years of human carbon dioxide emissions at current levels. And if all that carbon were released, it’s almost certainly enough to push the planet past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels.</p>





<p>“This is the carbon we must protect to avert climate catastrophe,” says Monica Noon, an environmental data scientist at Conservation International in Arlington, Va. Current efforts to keep global warming<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">&nbsp;below the ambitious target of 1.5 degrees C</a>&nbsp;require that we reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and that carbon stored in nature stays put (<em>SN:12/17/18</em>).&nbsp;But agriculture and other development pressures threaten some of these carbon stores.</p>



<p>To map this at-risk carbon, Noon and her colleagues combined satellite data with estimates of how much total carbon is stored in ecosystems vulnerable to human incursion. The researchers excluded areas like permafrost, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">stores lots of carbon</a> but isn’t likely to be developed (although it’s thawing due to warming), as well as tree plantations, which have already been altered (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). The researchers then calculated how much carbon would get released from land conversions, such as clearing a forest for farmland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That land might store varying amounts of carbon, depending on whether it becomes a palm oil plantation or a parking lot. To simplify, the researchers assumed cleared land was left alone, with saplings free to grow where giants once stood. That allowed the researchers to estimate how long it might take for the released carbon to be reintegrated into the land. Much of that carbon would remain in the air by 2050, the team reports, as many of these ecosystems take centuries to return to their former glory, rendering it irrecoverable on a timescale that matters for addressing climate change.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Carbon-rich lands</h3>



<p>Researchers mapped the location and density of Earth’s irrecoverable carbon — carbon locked in ecosystems that is potentially vulnerable to release from human development and, if lost, could not be restored to those ecosystems by 2050. Areas of exceptionally high density of irrecoverable carbon (purple) include the Pacific Northwest, the Amazon, the Congo Basin and Borneo.</p>

<p>Releasing that 139 gigatons of irrecoverable carbon could have irrevocable consequences. For comparison, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that humans can emit only 109 more gigatons of carbon to have a two-thirds chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C. “These are the places we absolutely have to protect,” Noon says.</p>



<p>Approximately half of this irrecoverable carbon sits on just 3.3 percent of Earth’s total land area, equivalent to roughly the area of India and Mexico combined. Key areas are in the Amazon, the Pacific Northwest, and the tropical forests and mangroves of Borneo. “The fact that it’s so concentrated means we can protect it,” Noon says.</p>



<p>Roughly half of irrecoverable carbon already falls within existing protected areas or lands managed by Indigenous peoples. Adding an additional 8 million square kilometers of protected area, which is only about 5.4 percent of the planet’s land surface, would bring 75 percent of this carbon under some form of protection, Noon says.</p>



<p>“It’s really important to have spatially explicit maps of where these irrecoverable carbon stocks are,” says Kate Dooley, a geographer at the University of Melbourne in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a small percentage globally, but it’s still a lot of land.” Many of these dense stores are in places at high risk of development, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s so hard to stop this drive of deforestation,” she says, but these maps will help focus the efforts of governments, civil society groups and academics on the places that matter most for the climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-mass-binary-system-carbon-factories-space">How massive stars in binary systems turn into carbon factories</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next time you thank your lucky stars, you might want to bless the binaries. New calculations indicate that a massive star whose outer layer gets torn off by a companion star ends up shedding a lot more carbon than if the star had been born a loner.</p>



<p>“That star is making about twice as much carbon as a single star would make,” says Rob Farmer, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany.</p>



<p>All life on Earth is based on carbon, the fourth most abundant element in the cosmos, after hydrogen, helium and oxygen. Like nearly every chemical element heavier than helium, carbon is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">formed in stars</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). For many elements, astronomers have been able to pin down the main source. For example, oxygen comes almost entirely from massive stars, most of which explode, while nitrogen is made mostly in lower-mass stars, which don’t explode. In contrast, carbon arises both in massive and lower-mass stars. Astronomers would like to know exactly which types of stars forged the lion’s share of this vital element.</p>



<p>Farmer and his colleagues looked specifically at massive stars, which are at least eight times heavier than the sun, and calculated how they behave with and without partners. Nuclear reactions at the core of a massive star first turn hydrogen into helium. When the core runs out of hydrogen, the star expands, and soon the core starts converting helium into carbon.</p>





<p>But massive stars usually have companion stars, adding a twist to the storyline: When the star expands, the companion’s gravity can tear off the larger star’s outer envelope, exposing the helium core. That allows freshly minted carbon to stream into space via a flow of particles.</p>



<p>“In these very massive stars, these winds are quite strong,” Farmer says. For instance, his team’s calculations indicate that the wind of a star born 40 times as massive as the sun with a close companion ejects 1.1 solar masses of carbon before dying. In comparison, a single star born with the same mass <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04131">ejects just 0.2 solar masses worth of carbon</a>, the researchers report in a paper submitted to arXiv.org October 8 and in press at the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>If the massive star then explodes, it also can outperform a supernova from a solo massive star. That’s because, when the companion star removes the massive star’s envelope, the helium core shrinks. This contraction leaves some carbon behind, outside the core. As a result, nuclear reactions can’t convert that carbon into heavier elements such as oxygen, leaving more carbon to be cast &nbsp;into space by the explosion. Had the star been single, the core would have destroyed much of that carbon.</p>



<p>By analyzing the output from massive stars of different masses, Farmer’s team concludes that the average massive star in a binary ejects 1.4 to 2.6 times as much carbon through winds and supernova explosions as the average massive star that’s single.</p>



<p>Given how many massive stars are in binaries, astronomer Stan Woosley says emphasizing binary-star evolution, as the researchers have done, is helpful in pinning down the origin of a crucial element. But “I think they are making too strong a claim based on models that may be sensitive to uncertain physics,” says Woosley, of the University of California, Santa Cruz. In particular, he says, mass-loss rates for massive stars are not known well enough to assert a specific difference in carbon production between single and binary stars.</p>



<p>Farmer acknowledges the uncertainty, but “the overall picture is sound,” he says. “The binaries are making more [carbon].”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glitter-eco-friendly-green-alternative-cellulose-plant-color">This eco-friendly glitter gets its color from plants, not plastic</a></h4>

              
                <p>All that glitters is not green. Glitter and shimmery pigments are often made using toxic compounds or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-microplastics-travel-far-wind">pollutive microplastics</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). That makes the sparkly stuff, notoriously difficult to clean up in the house, a scourge on the environment too.</p>



<p>A new, nontoxic, biodegradable alternative could change that. In the material, cellulose — the main building block of plant cell walls — creates nanoscale patterns that give rise to vibrant <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-ink-printer-butterflies-color-spectrum-microscale-pattern">structural colors</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/21</em>). Such <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01135-8">a material</a> could be used to make eco-friendly glitter and shiny pigments for paints, cosmetics or packaging, researchers report November 11 in <em>Nature Materials</em>.</p>



<p>The inspiration to harness cellulose came from the African plant <em>Pollia condensata</em>, which produces bright, iridescent blue fruits called marble berries. Tiny patterns of cellulose fibers in the berries’ cell walls reflect specific wavelengths of light to create the signature hue. “I thought, if the plants can make it, we should be able to make it,” says chemist Silvia Vignolini of the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vignolini and colleagues whipped up a watery mixture containing cellulose fibers and poured it onto plastic. As the liquid dried into a film, the rodlike fibers settled into helical structures resembling spiral staircases. Tweaking factors such as the steepness of those staircases changed which wavelengths of light the cellulose arrangements reflected, and therefore the color of the film.</p>



<p>That allowed the researchers, like fairy-tale characters spinning straw into gold, to transform their clear, plant-based slurry into meter-long shimmery ribbons in a rainbow of colors. These swaths could then be peeled off their plastic platform and ground up to make glitter.</p>

<p>“You can use any type of cellulose,” Vignolini says. Her team used cellulose from wood pulp, but could have used fruit peels or cotton fibers left over from textile production.</p>



<p>The researchers need to test the environmental impacts of their newfangled glitter. But Vignolini is optimistic that materials using such natural ingredients have a bright future.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do we change beliefs that are contrary to the scientific consensus? Given that such misperceptions can be harmful to the believers, their families, and even to broader society, research in this area is vital. Now Aart van Stekelenburg at Radboud University and colleagues report preliminary but promising work finding that a brief training exercise on the value of scientific consensus, and how to look for it, can help. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211007788">Their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> suggests that this could be a more effective approach than just communicating what the scientific consensus is — at least, for some false beliefs.</p>



<span id="more-44614"></span>



<p>For one of their studies, the team recruited 854 US-based participants who all believed that genetically engineered food is worse for our health than non-GM food. Some participants were given an infographic that explained how a scientific consensus develops and why it’s very useful in deciding whether or not a new claim is likely to be true. It also provided a three-step guide to evaluating a new claim (as might be found in a news article, say):</p>



<ul><li>Look for a statement indicating consensus</li><li>Check the source making the consensus statement</li><li>Evaluate the expertise of the consensus</li></ul>



<p>The training also included a short practice session, with feedback on how to apply these steps.</p>



<p>These participants, plus another group who were not given this three-step guide, read a 2017 news article from <em>Science</em> about a new fungus-resistant, genetically engineered banana. For some participants, the article mentioned that a survey had found that 92% of &#8220;working PhD biomedical scientists&#8221; said that GM food was just as safe to eat as non-GM food. It did, then, communicate the scientific consensus on this topic — and overall, participants who saw this statement felt more positive about GM food than those who did not. But importantly, those in the training group showed even bigger shifts in their beliefs towards the consensus that those who hadn’t received the training. The team argues that the findings represent “extreme evidence in favor of boosting consensus reasoning”, to help correct misperceptions.</p>



<p>However, when the team ran a very similar study on climate change sceptics, they did not get this result; the consensus reasoning training did not change these participants’ belief that current climate change is not primarily down to human action.</p>



<p>There are a few possible reasons for the different results, the team thinks. Trust in climate scientists in the US is relatively low; if you don’t trust the scientists in the first place, you’re presumably less likely to be interested in or swayed by any consensus. Also, the scientific consensus on climate change has been widely highlighted in regular and social media. So it’s possible that this group already knew all about the consensus, and held their beliefs anyway — while perhaps the GM food group started out less aware of the consensus that genetically engineered food is safe, and so were more responsive to the messaging, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Overall, though, there are arguments in favour of boosting consensus reasoning in any case, the team writes. One is this: rather than telling someone what they <em>should</em> believe, the training is designed to “empower individuals to be able to understand and make the best use of the available information regarding a scientific consensus”.</p>



<p>Clearly, this is preliminary research, and the results were mixed. But as what seems to be the first experimental work to test messaging about scientific consensuses among people who hold contrary beliefs, it’s a useful step forwards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">How missing data makes it harder to measure racial bias in policing</a></h4>

              
                <p>From 2012 to 2015, a team of researchers collected 2.9 million police officer patrol records in Chicago. The team’s analysis of that data, from nearly 7,000 officers, showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hispanic-female-police-use-force-less-than-white-male-officers">Black police officers were less likely to arrest</a> civilians than white police officers patrolling the same neighborhood (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/11/21</em>). Officers arrested on average eight people per shift, with Black officers making 24 percent fewer arrests than white officers. But an alternate analysis, one that excluded shifts where no arrests occurred, flipped the results. That made it appear as if Black officers issued 12 percent more arrests than white officers.</p>



<p>Failing to account for events that don’t happen — police allowing a jaywalker to pass, opting not to make an arrest (usually for minor issues like possessing a small amount of drugs) or never firing a drawn gun — is problematic, says policing expert Dean Knox of the University of Pennsylvania. “Instead of drawing the conclusion that minority officers are engaging in less enforcement,” he says of his Chicago study, “you could mistakenly conclude that they are engaging in more enforcement.” &nbsp;The flip occurred because, compared with white officers, Black officers more often went out on patrols without issuing any arrests.</p>



<p>Nonevents of this nature are commonly excluded in policing data. Though a large body of evidence suggests that police in the United States discriminate against Black people, Knox says, many police departments only collect data on a smattering of the interactions between their officers and civilians. Cell phone videos, like those of Eric Garner in a chokehold and George Floyd struggling to breathe,&nbsp;tend to emerge only when encounters have spiraled out of control. That makes it difficult to measure racial bias in policing or come up with targeted solutions to reduce that bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How, though, can researchers studying policing account for nonevents? The laborious Chicago data collection by Knox and his team is not always feasible. And even that rigorous study, reported in <em>Science </em>earlier this year, still had gaps: The team had data on when police stopped, arrested or used force on civilians, but not on minor interactions that didn’t meet the department’s recording requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>When research teams <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm3432">accept these problematic datasets at face value</a>, writes Knox in a November 4 essay in <em>Science, </em>they often arrive at contradictory conclusions. Disagreements in the literature allow public officials and the media to cherry-pick studies that support their viewpoint, whether arguing for or against implicit bias training to overcome unconscious stereotypes or prioritizing the recruitment of minority officers.</p>





<h4>A long chain of events </h4>



<p>Knox wrote the essay following the publication of a controversial, and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877">now retracted</a>, study that appeared in 2019 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> “White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers,” the authors of that study wrote. They concluded that policies aimed at increasing police diversity would do little to stem racial disparities in police killings.</p>



<p>The study gained enormous traction, especially among conservative media outlets and politicians, Knox says. “This was one of the go-to pieces that people use to deny the existence of bias in policing.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the authors’ findings were mathematically baseless, says Knox, who along with Jonathan Mummolo, a policing expert at Princeton University, wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@jon.mummolo/prominent-claims-that-policing-is-not-racially-biased-rest-on-flawed-science-6f66535dc7e5">debunking the study</a> in<em> Medium</em>. Some 800 academics and researchers signed the piece. The team failed to consider total police encounters and then measure what fraction of those encounters resulted in deadly violence, Knox says.</p>

<p>But that narrow focus on fatal police shootings, a rare occurrence that typically happens at the culmination of a long chain of events, ignores all potential biases earlier in the chain, Knox says. The first potential bias in a chain of events starts with an officer’s decision to approach a civilian or let them pass. Knox acknowledges that&nbsp;a separate layer of research is needed to&nbsp;account for societal level disparities, such as&nbsp;the presence of more officers in&nbsp;Black, often impoverished,&nbsp;neighborhoods and longstanding discriminatory practices that reduce the quality of education and other services in such neighborhoods.</p>



<p>“Even if you can’t see all the things that happened before, just acknowledging they exist is imperative,” Knox says.</p>



<p>Consider this real-life example. On July 10, 2015, Texas state trooper Brian Encinia pulled over Sandra Bland, a Black woman, for failing to signal a lane change. The exchange grew heated and culminated with Encinia arresting Bland for failing to follow orders. Bland’s subsequent death in a county jail caused public outcry.</p>



<p>Focusing solely on Bland’s arrest, and not all that happened before, would provide little information on how Bland wound up in jail for such a minor offense, or how to prevent such an outcome in the future. But because Encinia’s body camera recorded the entire exchange, policing researchers, in this case interested in tone and language, could identify key steps leading up to her arrest. For instance, the researchers reported in <em>Law and Society Review</em> in 2017, Encinia’s <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12265">language starts off polite</a> but becomes increasingly agitated as Bland refuses to comply with his orders. His once formal commands, such as “step out of the car” become informal and unprofessional: “I’m going to yank you out of here.”</p>



<p>That word “yank” indicates that Encinia is losing control of the situation, says Belén Lowrey-Kinberg, a criminologist at St. Francis College in New York City. Previous research has shown that when officers pivot from formal to informal language, violence can follow.</p>



<p>While this is a case study of a single event, the study provides “a great example of how situations can escalate,” says criminologist Justin Nix of the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>



<h4>Fixing flawed data</h4>



<p>Flawed police data does not need to be thrown out, Knox says. His team has developed an algorithm to account for gaps in the data at all points in a police-civilian interaction. The algorithm weights the various possible degrees of discrimination at each point in a chain of events — perhaps race did not factor into Encinia’s decision to pull Bland over because he could not see her face, for example, or maybe race played a large role because most drivers in that area are white. The range of values resulting from the summation of those events suggests the possible amounts of discrimination in any given scenario, Knox says.</p>



<p>The program operates on a very general principle, Knox says. “What are the data that you see?” and “What are the data that you don’t see?”</p>



<p>Thinking about the whole chain of events also points to how to collect better statistics.</p>



<p>Consider a study of police shootings by Nix and policing expert John Shjarback of Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., that appeared November 10 in <em>PLOS One.</em> The researchers were interested in racial disparities in officers’ use of force against Black and white civilians. National databases include only shootings that result in a civilian’s death. But whether someone lives or dies after being shot hinges on several factors, such as proximity to a trauma center, location of the gunshot wound and access to first aid. So researchers sought to examine all police shootings, including those that resulted in injury but not death. To do so, they relied on records from four states — California, Colorado, Florida and Texas — that have collected this information for years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Flawed police data does not need to be thrown out. An algorithm that accounts for gaps in the data operates on a very general principle. “What are the data that you see?” and “What are the data that you don’t see?”</p><cite>Dean Knox, the University of Pennsylvania</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The data revealed that some <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259024">45 percent of victims suffer nonfatal injuries</a>. Factoring in the relative populations of Black and white civilians showed that for all four states, racial disparities in injuries were higher than racial disparities in fatalities. For example, from 2009 to 2014 in Florida, Black people were roughly three times more likely than whites to be shot and killed by police, but over five times more likely to be injured. Across all four states, and for reasons that are not entirely clear, Black victims are 7 percent less likely to die of their injuries than white victims.</p>



<p>National databases that only include records of civilians who die at the hands of the police underestimate officers’ use of deadly force against Black civilians, Nix says. Death “is the end of a very long sequence of events. In our paper we backed up one link in the chain.” That is, the researchers looked at all instances where officers used deadly force and not just those that resulted in death. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Knox is now working with two police departments to break down police-civilian encounters in more detail. Those departments require officers to turn on their body cameras when they believe an interaction with a civilian will rise to the level of an official interaction. (Officers have discretion at this point in the process, Knox acknowledges, so as with the Chicago study, that first link in the chain remains elusive.) Knox and his team will analyze scripts from each encounter for language and tone, such as normal voice or shouting — a quantitative version of the approach Lowrey-Kinberg used to unpack the encounter between Encinia and Bland. Computer vision techniques will parse out gestures, such as “weapon drawn.” Knox says he hopes the data will help his team get closer to reconstructing entire interactions, including identifying nonevents in any given chain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You don’t want just the side of the story as written by an officer,” Knox says. “You want the whole interaction.”</p>
