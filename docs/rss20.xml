	<description>&lt;p&gt;A diabetes journal has issued two notices of concern for papers co-authored by a researcher who took another publisher to court after it did the same thing — but ultimately lost. The notices are for two papers co-authored by Mario Saad — who, after losing his legal battle with the American Diabetes Association, has since […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Introduction to signal processing using FFT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2017-05-18:/2017/05/18/introduction-to-signal-processing-using-fft.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2017/05/18/introduction-to-signal-processing-using-fft.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A Fourier Transform takes a signal (usually acoustic or any sequence of data) and finds the frequencies that are dominant in the signal.  For example: A pure middle 'C' note from piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;loweralpha simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source separation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying emotions in voices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's important for me as I am researching in emotion detection from speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a very efficient algorithm for computing the power spectrum (Fourier transform). The normal Fourier Transform is a O(N^2), whereas FFT is O( N log(N)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this workshop I will show how FFT can be performed in real-time and I will show how human voices produce different power spectrum.  I will also let the audience see what their own vocal profile looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; 19/05/2017 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 16:00 &lt;br /&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese biomedical researchers estimate that 40% of research in their country has been affected in some way by misconduct, according to a new survey. The authors are quick to caution against putting too much stock in this figure due to the subjective nature of the survey, published in Science and Engineering Ethics. The estimates also […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLOS is pleased to announce the appointment of Alison Mudditt as its Chief Executive Officer, effective June 19, 2017.  For the past six years Mudditt served as Director of University of California Press (UC Press) where she ushered in new strategies to lead the company into the digital age, including the innovative journal and monograph Open Access programs Collabra and Luminos. Prior to UC Press, Mudditt was Executive Vice President at SAGE Publications, Inc., leading publishing programs across books, journals and digital platforms. Her 25 plus years in the publishing industry include leadership positions at Blackwell Publishers in Oxford, UK, and Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Inc., in Philadelphia, US. Mudditt received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Bath and her Masters in Business Administration from The Open University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PLOS is truly privileged to bring on board a person of Alison’s caliber whose extensive experience in and deep knowledge of academic publishing will invigorate a renewed focus on our mission—transforming research communication to better serve authors, readers and the public,” said Gary Ward, Chairman of the Board at PLOS. “Her history and accomplishments as a leader, coalition builder and strategic thinker for organizations experiencing change is impressive and will prove very valuable to PLOS in the years ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to join a like-minded publisher in PLOS, which fully embraces the Open Access principles that drive its mission,” said Mudditt. “PLOS’ long-held reputation as a change agent in this industry provides a tremendously gratifying challenge as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in scientific publishing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a stereotype that has improved a little over the years but still persists: women are more emotionally expressive than men. Like Bridget Jones, we constantly reveal exactly how we’re feeling, while men, Mark Darcy-like, look on impassively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although prior evidence suggests that women &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.305&quot;&gt;really do smile more often&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173942&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;, has considered a greater variety of facial expressions, and it finds that the gender pattern is more complex, with some emotions displayed more by men than women. Arguably, this work helps to reveal not only differences in the emotional signals men and women send to others, but also differences in the emotions that we feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23968&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel McDuff of Microsoft Research, Redmond, US and his team used a new automated facial coding technology to analyse the expressions of 2,106 people as they watched a series of 10 video adverts at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were crowdsourced from France, Germany, China, the US and the UK. While they watched ads from their own countries on everything from confectionary to cars, their webcams streamed images of their faces to a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women smiled more than the men, replicating the earlier research. They also engaged in more “inner brow raises”, an expression taken to indicate fear or sadness. But the men frowned more. Frowns are usually taken to be a show of anger, though the researchers noted that in this study, they might have reflected greater concentration, or confusion. There were no gender differences in some other expressions, including downturned mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate in psychology about the extent to which facial expressions, including smiles and frowns, actually reflect and match felt emotions. When you smile, is it always because you’re feeling happy? Or do you sometimes smile when you’re anxious? And just because you’re frowning, does it necessarily mean you’re mad – or you just want someone else to think you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given work &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;amp;doi=10.1037/1528-3542.5.2.175&quot;&gt;suggesting there is a close association&lt;/a&gt; between emotions and facial expressions, an implication of the new results is that women are more prone to feeling happy and also more anxious (or at least more inclined to show these emotions), and that men are more likely to feel angry (or more confused…), which raises the question of why might this be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDuff and his team suggested that at least part of the explanation could be down to the different social expectations and pressures placed on the genders. For example, there’s evidence that in many countries, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022104268387&quot;&gt;happiness is seen as more desirable for girls than boys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an account would help explain why the size of the observed gender differences varied around the world, being the smallest in the UK, consistent with the idea that gender-related social expectations are less marked in some countries than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few other geographical differences: women in the US were the smiliest, while women in the UK and Germany frowned least. But the general data patterns in each of the five countries were the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation with the study was the fact that volunteers knew they were being videoed, which might have influenced their reactions. But a major advantage was the use of rapid automated coding technology. This allowed for many more participants than would normally be practical in research on facial expressions, which are usually decoded by a researcher. Crowdsourcing volunteers and using computer-based decoding, as in this case, could open the way for many more mass-studies of emotion and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173942&quot;&gt;A large-scale analysis of sex differences in facial expressions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The paper is called The confounding factors leading to plagiarism in academic writing and some suggested remedies. It recently appeared in the Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association (JPMA) and it's written by two Saudi Arabia-based authors, Salman Yousuf Guraya and Shaista Salman Guraya.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Could a scientific paper ever be considered an advertisement? That was the question posed to a Tokyo court, in a criminal case where prosecutors argued — at the behest of Japan’s ministry of health — that a peer-reviewed paper containing faked data should be considered “fraudulent or exaggerated advertising” under that country’s laws. In that case, […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Best and Worst of Neuroscience and Neurology – April 2017</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22639</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/17/best-and-worst-of-neuroscience-and-neurology-april-2017/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2017.00120/full&quot;&gt;neuroscience publications&lt;/a&gt; steadily grows over the years. In 2006, around 27,000 paper on this subject were published, while in 2015 this number went up to almost 37,000. This is a seriously big increase that reflects the importance of brain science and the growing interest in this field of research. The selection of articles presented here covers a wide range of topics, from purely academic subjects to the findings of clinical significance and newly discovered facts that will be of interest to almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 25 April 1971, David Eagleman was celebrating his birthday. David is probably one of the best known neuroscientists these days, thanks to his books and TV series. In the academic world, Dr Eagleman is better known for hit works on the relationship between timing of perception and timing of neural signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEST &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New type of cells discovered in brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4558.html&quot;&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; touches again on how little we still know about the brain. A new type of brain cell, mural lymphatic endothelial cells&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; were reported in the article published this week. The function of these cells, which are &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/12/microglia-part-1-definitions-and-developmental-progression/&quot;&gt;lymphatic&lt;/a&gt; in their origin, is to clean up the brain from accumulating cellular debris and thus prevent the damage to normal healthy cells of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial synapse capable of learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain synapses are central for our ability to learn. Stimulation of synapses strengthen the connection between the neurons and thus enhances the learning. A similar approach was used when researchers created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14736&quot;&gt;electronic synapse&lt;/a&gt; called memristor. Although the physical components of this nano-device have nothing to do with the real synapses in brain, the underlying principle is still the same. The devices of this kind will be important for the developing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/08/20/creating-an-artificial-brain/&quot;&gt;artificial brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doxycycline for treating Parkinson’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doxycycline has been used to treat bacterial infection for well over 50 years. New &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41755&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this antibiotic may have a new application: to treat Parkinson’s disease. This disease is caused by abnormal accumulation and toxicity of protein alpha-synuclein. In cell culture, the scientists observed that the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates is reduced by 80% in the presence of doxycycline. Mice models with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; fed on the diet with addition of doxycycline improved their symptoms. Human trials with low doses of doxycycline are now being planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelics and higher state of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of psychedelics such as LSD on brain function are poorly studied. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month has reported that psychedelics induce increased signal diversity, as shown by brain imaging methods. Signal diversity is considered to be a measure of the complexity of brain activity. In the subjects exposed to the drugs, this measure was higher then the baseline value in the normal condition. Researchers conclude that, under the influence of psychedelics, the brain experiences a changed state of consciousness. The question remains whether this is a ‘better’ or more desirable state, and whether the psychedelic drugs can be used for &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/05/psychedelic-assisted-therapy-the-mental-health-trip-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;therapeutic applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing brain tissue in a lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling the brain is very hard due to the complexity of this organ. While most other tissues and even organs can be grown in a laboratory artificially, the brain has resisted attempts thus far. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(17)30116-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671117301169%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month reported a successful attempt to do exactly this. Researchers successfully turned &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/&quot;&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; into tiny cultures of brain cells with several cell types typical for the midbrain. This is a very important methodological development that will help to facilitate the study of both the healthy brain and various brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspirin does not benefit cognitive functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is one of the oldest drugs still in use. Surprisingly, new beneficial qualities of this simple molecule are still being discovered. With only small and manageable side effects, low-dose aspirin is even recommended as a daily drug for older healthy individuals, for reducing the risk of serious conditions such as cardiovascular problems. There were many reports suggesting that aspirin might also be useful for protection against dementia and cognitive decline. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.14883/abstract;jsessionid=1C755DC1975C6C3C275E050E53382E17.f04t01&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of existing data published this month found no evidence to support this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda drinking damages brain and accelerates its aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that sugary drinks are bad for general health is well known. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(17)30050-X/abstract&quot;&gt;New data&lt;/a&gt; based on a long-term study show that they are also damaging for brain functions. People consuming two or more sugary drinks at any time per day have poorer memory, decreased overall volume of the brain, and  a smaller hippocampus (a part of the brain associated with memory and learning). On the MRI scans their showed more prominent features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/25/exercise-and-brain-aging/&quot;&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; compared to people who don’t consume sugary beverages. Interestingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/48/5/1139&quot;&gt;switching to diet drinks&lt;/a&gt; containing artificial sweeteners doesn’t help much: people consuming at least one diet soda a day are three times more likely to develop dementia and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marmite: bad choice for brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marmite, a food spread popular in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, might be not as safe and healthy as usually assumed. A rather curious piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881117699613&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this month demonstrated that daily consumption of Marmite (one teaspoon every day) results in a 30% decrease in the brain response to visual stimuli. The effect is explained by the high content of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/07/30/vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-its-neurological-consequences/&quot;&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; in Marmite. This vitamin regulates the level of neurotransmitter GABA that has an inhibitory effect on the excitability of some neurons. The findings show that the food we eat may have substantial effects on our brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A link between cancer chemotherapy and depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always difficult to figure out if the depression that cancer patients often experience is caused by the psychological stress of having cancer, or also because of chemotherapy. New &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v7/n4/full/tp201768a.html&quot;&gt;research data&lt;/a&gt; obtained on healthy mice receiving drugs for brain cancer demonstrated that chemotherapy prevents formation of new cells in the hippocampus, a region of brain involved in memory formation and emotions. The treatment also resulted in the release of stress hormones and clear signs of depression. Brain cancer patients appear to be some of the most affected by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/&quot;&gt;treatment-related depression&lt;/a&gt;, which remains mostly undiagnosed. Understanding that depression might be related to treatment will help to develop therapies to counteract this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multitasking: few advantages, brain overloading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to multitask is often praised as a valuable skill, but does it really bring any advantages? New &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23591/abstract&quot;&gt;research data&lt;/a&gt; seriously questions the value of multitasking. Performing several tasks at the same task reduces productivity by 40%. Moreover, the findings show that frequent switching between tasks interferes with brain activity. Scientists also point out the danger of the continuous use of social media as it is an additional task for our brain and thus reduces the effectiveness of other tasks performed at the same time. It appears that focusing on a single task for a longer period of time brings better results than &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/19/neural-basis-of-multitasking/&quot;&gt;multitasking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How apps can support people to moderate their drinking</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/17/how-apps-can-support-people-to-moderate-their-drinking/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/16026889030_4453dd4ea7_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widespread use of smart phone applications, or ‘apps’, offers a unique opportunity for organizations to reach and engage with people in new ways in order to promote and support health-related behavior changes, including encouraging reductions in drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do they actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…of the 662 alcohol related apps available in the UK in 2014…just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977135&quot;&gt;91 (14%) focused on alcohol reduction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit of apps is that they can deliver evidence-based behavior change techniques and other content to users, targeting their behaviors when and where these are actually carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the 662 alcohol related apps available in the UK in 2014, 357 (54%) were entertainment apps (including drinking games, cocktail recipes and bar finders), 125 (19%) related to blood alcohol measurement, and just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977135&quot;&gt;91 (14%) focused on alcohol reduction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinkaware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Drinkaware launched &lt;em&gt;Drinkaware: Track and Calculate Units&lt;/em&gt; – a new app designed specifically to help people wanting to monitor and cut down on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, on Android and iOS, contains techniques that can help users to self-monitor the alcohol units and calories in their drinks and it provides them with information about the health benefits of cutting down. It also allows users to set their own individual goals and offers support and motivation through regular personalized feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the app that was evaluated in our study also contained a “weak spot” feature that allowed users to work towards breaking the habit of drinking in excess when they find themselves in self-designated “risky” locations for drinking (e.g. the local pub).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2015, the app was updated to include a cost tracking feature which allows users to add up the price of their drinks so they can be more aware of the consequences of cutting back that reach beyond their health alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the app has been downloaded more than 380,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4358-9&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; presents an analysis of the first 13 months of app usage based on data from 119,713 existing users and qualitative interviews with 21 users. The study presents novel insights into how real app users perceived this product, how they interacted with the features that it contained, and also explored what those who are downloading alcohol reduction apps are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who engaged for longer with the app tended to be high risk drinkers who reported being motivated to reduce drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of app usage found that there was a high level of drop out after one week and that users who engaged for longer with the app tended to be high risk drinkers who reported being motivated to reduce drinking. For those who consistently engaged with the app over time, self-reported alcohol consumption levels reduced in the first week of use and leveled out thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study found that the Drinkaware app is a useful tool for supporting behavior change in people who are already motivated and committed to reducing their alcohol consumption. However, the in-depth interviews suggested that the app would benefit from greater personalization and tailoring to promote longer term use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drinkaware team is now considering how these improvements can be implemented, while also exploring the app’s value as a tool for providing a one-off brief alcohol assessment and opportunities for the app to link to other lifestyle behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore how different apps may best help people with different support needs and personal preferences, assessing outcomes based on validated measures of alcohol consumption obtained independently of the app itself. Using routinely collected data offers an exciting opportunity for innovative research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing with others, helping people in need, consoling those who are distressed. All these behaviours can be encouraged by empathy – by understanding what other people are thinking and feeling, and sharing their emotions. Enhance empathy, especially in those who tend to have problems with it – like narcissists – and society as a whole might benefit. So how can it be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the cultivation of empathy is a “presumed benefit” of mindfulness training, note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2016.1269667&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/i&gt;, designed to investigate this experimentally. People who are “mindfully aware” focus on the present moment, without judgement. So, it’s been argued, they should be better able to resist getting caught up in their own thoughts, freeing them to think more about the mental states of other people. As mindfulness courses are increasingly being offered in schools and workplaces, as well as in mental health settings, it’s important to know what such training can and can’t achieve. The new results suggest it won’t foster empathy – and, worse, it could even backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24007&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Ridderinkhof, at the University of Amsterdam, and her colleagues divided 161 adult volunteers in three groups. Each completed questionnaires assessing their levels of narcissistic and also autistic traits. It’s already known that people who score highly on narcissism (who feel superior to others, believe they are entitled to privileges and want to be admired) tend to experience less “affective empathy”. They aren’t as likely to share the emotional state of another person. People who score highly on autistic traits have no problem with affective empathy, but tend to show impairments in “cognitive empathy”. They find it harder to work out what other people are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group spent five minutes in a guided mindfulness meditation, in which they were encouraged to focus on the physical sensations of breathing, while observing any thoughts, without judging them. The second group took part in a relaxation exercise (so any effects of stress relief alone could be examined). People in the control group were invited to let their minds wander, and to be immersed in their thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these exercises, the researchers tested the volunteers’ propensity to feel cognitive empathy, via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, which involves identifying emotions from photographs of people’s eyes, and they also tested their affective empathy, by analysing how much emotional concern they showed toward a player who was socially rejected in a ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some debate about whether a greater capacity for empathy would be helpful for most people. Some researchers, such as Professor Tania Singer, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, even suggest that an “excess” of empathy explains what’s often termed “burnout” in members of caring professions, such as nurses. But Ridderinkhof’s team predicted that mindfulness training would improve empathy in the volunteers who needed it most: in people with high levels of autistic or narcissistic traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t. While there was no overall effect on empathy in the mindfulness group, further analysis revealed that, compared with the control and relaxation groups combined, non-narcissists who completed the mindfulness exercise did show a slight improvement specifically in cognitive empathy, but for narcissistic people, their cognitive empathy was actually reduced. For the people who scored highly on autistic traits, meanwhile, there was no effect on mind-reading accuracy, though there were intriguing signs of greater prosocial behaviour, indicated by an increase in the number of passes of the ball to socially excluded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since volunteers were encouraged not to judge any thoughts they had during the mindfulness meditation, this might indeed have helped non-narcissists let go of self-critical thoughts, allowing them to think more about the mental states of others, the researchers suggest. “By contrast, it may have ironically ‘licensed’ narcissistic individuals to focus more exclusively on their self-aggrandising thoughts.” As a result, they may have thought even less about the mental states of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics may argue that a single five-minute mindfulness meditation exercise is simply not  enough, and that improvements in empathy – in non-narcissists, at least – might perhaps show up with longer sessions. While the research team thinks this is worth exploring, there is evidence from earlier studies (that lacked a proper control group) that five-minute sessions can increase accuracy on a mind-reading test, for example. It was reasonable to opt for a brief session in this study, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research might also investigate whether alternative approaches – perhaps training the related concept of “compassion” (which involves “feeling for” rather than “feeling with” a person in psychological pain, and is advocated by Singer) might help narcissists behave more pro-socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2016.1269667&quot;&gt;Does mindfulness meditation increase empathy? An experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: PD-1 expression by tumour-associated macrophages inhibits phagocytosis and tumour immunity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22396</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Tumour cells frequently overexpress the ligand for PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), facilitating their escape from the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, by binding to either the ligand or receptor, have shown notable clinical efficacy in patients with a variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Although it is well established that PD-1–PD-L1 blockade activates T cells, little is known about the role that this pathway may have in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here we show that both mouse and human TAMs express PD-1. TAM PD-1 expression increases over time in mouse models of cancer and with increasing disease stage in primary human cancers. TAM PD-1 expression correlates negatively with phagocytic potency against tumour cells, and blockade of PD-1–PD-L1 in vivo increases macrophage phagocytosis, reduces tumour growth and lengthens the survival of mice in mouse models of cancer in a macrophage-dependent fashion. This suggests that PD-1–PD-L1 therapies may also function through a direct effect on macrophages, with substantial implications for the treatment of cancer with these agents.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Human GLP-1 receptor transmembrane domain structure in complex with allosteric modulators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR) are members of the secretin-like class B family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and have opposing physiological roles in insulin release and glucose homeostasis. The treatment of type 2 diabetes requires positive modulation of GLP-1R to inhibit glucagon secretion and stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Here we report crystal structures of the human GLP-1R transmembrane domain in complex with two different negative allosteric modulators, PF-06372222 and NNC0640, at 2.7 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a common binding pocket for negative allosteric modulators, present in both GLP-1R and GCGR and located outside helices V–VII near the intracellular half of the receptor. The receptor is in an inactive conformation with compounds that restrict movement of the intracellular tip of helix VI, a movement that is generally associated with activation mechanisms in class A GPCRs. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis studies indicate that agonist positive allosteric modulators target the same general region, but in a distinct sub-pocket at the interface between helices V and VI, which may facilitate the formation of an intracellular binding site that enhances G-protein coupling.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: uORF-mediated translation allows engineered plant disease resistance without fitness costs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22372</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Controlling plant disease has been a struggle for humankind since the advent of agriculture. Studies of plant immune mechanisms have led to strategies of engineering resistant crops through ectopic transcription of plants’ own defence genes, such as the master immune regulatory gene NPR1 (ref. 1). However, enhanced resistance obtained through such strategies is often associated with substantial penalties to fitness, making the resulting products undesirable for agricultural applications. To remedy this problem, we sought more stringent mechanisms of expressing defence proteins. On the basis of our latest finding that translation of key immune regulators, such as TBF1 (ref. 3), is rapidly and transiently induced upon pathogen challenge (see accompanying paper), we developed a ‘TBF1-cassette’ consisting of not only the immune-inducible promoter but also two pathogen-responsive upstream open reading frames (uORFsTBF1) of the TBF1 gene. Here we demonstrate that inclusion of uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control over the production of snc1-1 (an autoactivated immune receptor) in Arabidopsis thaliana and AtNPR1 in rice enables us to engineer broad-spectrum disease resistance without compromising plant fitness in the laboratory or in the field. This broadly applicable strategy may lead to decreased pesticide use and reduce the selective pressure for resistant pathogens.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22371</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 In the absence of specialized immune cells, the need for plants to reprogram transcription to transition from growth-related activities to defence is well understood. However, little is known about translational changes that occur during immune induction. Using ribosome footprinting, here we perform global translatome profiling on Arabidopsis exposed to the microbe-associated molecular pattern elf18. We find that during this pattern-triggered immunity, translation is tightly regulated and poorly correlated with transcription. Identification of genes with altered translational efficiency leads to the discovery of novel regulators of this immune response. Further investigation of these genes shows that messenger RNA sequence features are major determinants of the observed translational efficiency changes. In the 5′ leader sequences of transcripts with increased translational efficiency, we find a highly enriched messenger RNA consensus sequence, R-motif, consisting of mostly purines. We show that R-motif regulates translation in response to pattern-triggered immunity induction through interaction with poly(A)-binding proteins. Therefore, this study provides not only strong evidence, but also a molecular mechanism, for global translational reprogramming during pattern-triggered immunity in plants.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from human pluripotent stem cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 A variety of tissue lineages can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells by mimicking embryonic development through stepwise exposure to morphogens, or by conversion of one differentiated cell type into another by enforced expression of master transcription factors. Here, to yield functional human haematopoietic stem cells, we perform morphogen-directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into haemogenic endothelium followed by screening of 26 candidate haematopoietic stem-cell-specifying transcription factors for their capacity to promote multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment in mouse hosts. We recover seven transcription factors (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1 and SPI1) that are sufficient to convert haemogenic endothelium into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that engraft myeloid, B and T cells in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Our combined approach of morphogen-driven differentiation and transcription-factor-mediated cell fate conversion produces haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from pluripotent stem cells and holds promise for modelling haematopoietic disease in humanized mice and for therapeutic strategies in genetic blood disorders.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Chromatin states define tumour-specific T cell dysfunction and reprogramming</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Tumour-specific CD8 T cells in solid tumours are dysfunctional, allowing tumours to progress. The epigenetic regulation of T cell dysfunction and therapeutic reprogrammability (for example, to immune checkpoint blockade) is not well understood. Here we show that T cells in mouse tumours differentiate through two discrete chromatin states: a plastic dysfunctional state from which T cells can be rescued, and a fixed dysfunctional state in which the cells are resistant to reprogramming. We identified surface markers associated with each chromatin state that distinguished reprogrammable from non-reprogrammable PD1hi dysfunctional T cells within heterogeneous T cell populations from tumours in mice; these surface markers were also expressed on human PD1hi tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Our study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as we define key transcription factors and epigenetic programs underlying T cell dysfunction and surface markers that predict therapeutic reprogrammability.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks</title>

 The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein–protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification–mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Evolutionary enhancement of Zika virus infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22365</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Zika virus (ZIKV) remained obscure until the recent explosive outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and South America (2015–2016). Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas. However, the underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly and explosively spread from Asia to the Americas are unclear. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and subsequently enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes. Here we show that NS1 antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical isolates from the most recent outbreak in the Americas were much more infectious in mosquitoes than the FSS13025 strain, which was isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed that these epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 strain because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at residue 188 in NS1. ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino acid substitution in the ZIKV FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results reveal that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 protein, resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structure of the full-length glucagon class B G-protein-coupled receptor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The human glucagon receptor, GCGR, belongs to the class B G-protein-coupled receptor family and plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Here we report the 3.0 Å crystal structure of full-length GCGR containing both the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain in an inactive conformation. The two domains are connected by a 12-residue segment termed the stalk, which adopts a β-strand conformation, instead of forming an α-helix as observed in the previously solved structure of the GCGR transmembrane domain. The first extracellular loop exhibits a β-hairpin conformation and interacts with the stalk to form a compact β-sheet structure. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange, disulfide crosslinking and molecular dynamics studies suggest that the stalk and the first extracellular loop have critical roles in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation. These insights into the full-length GCGR structure deepen our understanding of the signalling mechanisms of class B G-protein-coupled receptors.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Identification of preoptic sleep neurons using retrograde labelling and gene profiling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22350</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 In humans and other mammalian species, lesions in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus cause profound sleep impairment, indicating a crucial role of the preoptic area in sleep generation. However, the underlying circuit mechanism remains poorly understood. Electrophysiological recordings and c-Fos immunohistochemistry have shown the existence of sleep-active neurons in the preoptic area, especially in the ventrolateral preoptic area and median preoptic nucleus. Pharmacogenetic activation of c-Fos-labelled sleep-active neurons has been shown to induce sleep. However, the sleep-active neurons are spatially intermingled with wake-active neurons, making it difficult to target the sleep neurons specifically for circuit analysis. Here we identify a population of preoptic area sleep neurons on the basis of their projection target and discover their molecular markers. Using a lentivirus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or a light-activated chloride channel for retrograde labelling, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation, and optrode recording, we show that the preoptic area GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus are both sleep active and sleep promoting. Furthermore, translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing identify candidate markers for these neurons, and optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations demonstrate that several peptide markers (cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and tachykinin 1) label sleep-promoting neurons. Together, these findings provide easy genetic access to sleep-promoting preoptic area neurons and a valuable entry point for dissecting the sleep control circuit.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22332</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coordination in groups faces a sub-optimization problem and theory suggests that some randomness may help to achieve global optima. Here we performed experiments involving a networked colour coordination game in which groups of humans interacted with autonomous software agents (known as bots). Subjects (n = 4,000) were embedded in networks (n = 230) of 20 nodes, to which we sometimes added 3 bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioural randomness and different geodesic locations. We show that bots acting with small levels of random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6%. This is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioural randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were connected easier, but also by affecting the gameplay of the humans among themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination in these heterogeneous systems.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Conversion of adult endothelium to immunocompetent haematopoietic stem cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22326</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The induction phase (days 0–8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During the specification phase (days 8–20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase of rEC-HSCs (days 20–28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition of TGFβ and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation of rEC-HSCs. Pluripotency-independent conversion of endothelial cells into autologous authentic engraftable haematopoietic stem cells could aid treatment of haematological disorders.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cancer progression by reprogrammed BCAA metabolism in myeloid leukaemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22314</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Reprogrammed cellular metabolism is a common characteristic observed in various cancers. However, whether metabolic changes directly regulate cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. Here we show that BCAT1, a cytosolic aminotransferase for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is aberrantly activated and functionally required for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans and in mouse models of CML. BCAT1 is upregulated during progression of CML and promotes BCAA production in leukaemia cells by aminating the branched-chain keto acids. Blocking BCAT1 gene expression or enzymatic activity induces cellular differentiation and impairs the propagation of blast crisis CML both in vitro and in vivo. Stable-isotope tracer experiments combined with nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analysis demonstrate the intracellular production of BCAAs by BCAT1. Direct supplementation with BCAAs ameliorates the defects caused by BCAT1 knockdown, indicating that BCAT1 exerts its oncogenic function through BCAA production in blast crisis CML cells. Importantly, BCAT1 expression not only is activated in human blast crisis CML and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia, but also predicts disease outcome in patients. As an upstream regulator of BCAT1 expression, we identified Musashi2 (MSI2), an oncogenic RNA binding protein that is required for blast crisis CML. MSI2 is physically associated with the BCAT1 transcript and positively regulates its protein expression in leukaemia. Taken together, this work reveals that altered BCAA metabolism activated through the MSI2–BCAT1 axis drives cancer progression in myeloid leukaemia.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Does High Testosterone Mean Low Empathy?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22642</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/16/high-testosterone-and-low-empathy/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is defined as the ability to understand the feelings, emotions, and perspective of another person.  Empathy is critical for healthy social interactions, and impairments in empathy contribute to disorders of social interaction such as autism and psychopathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women score higher on tests of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/26/do-insects-have-emotions-and-empathy/&quot;&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt; than men, leading researchers to examine a potential role for the male sex hormone testosterone in controlling empathy.  However, more recent studies have begun to explore the “dual hormone” hypothesis, that posits that testosterone interacts with the stress hormone cortisol to regulate social behaviours such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2010 study by Jack van Honk and colleagues investigated the effects of acute testosterone administration on cognitive empathy in female volunteers. The study participants were administered either a placebo or a 0.5 mg dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/10/08/testosterone-and-fatherhood-the-biology-of-building-a-family/&quot;&gt;testosterone &lt;/a&gt;under the tongue, after which they took a test called, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET).  This test measures how well an individual can interpret another’s emotions by reading expressions in the eye area of the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants took the test twice – once following administration of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/07/is-placebo-more-powerful-than-antidepressants-and-psychotherapy/&quot;&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, and once after testosterone treatment – to assess how testosterone affected each subject individually.  Overall, the testosterone treatment reduced women’s scores on the RMET, suggesting that it impaired their ability to “read” the emotions and intentions of others through facial expressions in the eye area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers went one step further and measured the 2D:4D ratio of the study participants. This measure indicates the ratio in length between the index finger (second digit) and ring finger (fourth digit) and is considered a proxy measure of prenatal testosterone exposure.  Men have lower 2D:4D ratios than women, and women exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb display masculinized (lower) digit ratios. Elevated levels of foetal testosterone can occur in diseases such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome, and women with these disorders display reduced digit ratios. However, lower 2D:4D ratios are also found in otherwise healthy women due to individual variations in foetal hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Honk &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. found that the RMET score reduction in response to testosterone was strongly correlated with the digit ratio, and that women with lower ratios (who thus had higher prenatal testosterone exposure) had stronger responses to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt;.  These findings suggest an interesting “priming” effect of male hormone exposure during development that makes the brain more responsive to testosterone in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings provide support for the controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/29/sex-bias-in-autism-spectrum-disorders-is-it-real/&quot;&gt;‘extreme male brain’ theory&lt;/a&gt; of autism, a disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviours. This theory posits that autism represents an extreme version of the normal male brain profile that is characterized by an increased systematizing ability and a reduced empathizing ability in comparison to females. The pathological impairment of empathy in autism may therefore arise from excessive “male” hormone levels during development.  Accordingly, reduced 2D:4D ratios have been observed in autistic individuals and in their first-degree relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this and other studies have demonstrated a clear inhibitory effect of testosterone on cognitive empathy, they tell only one part of the story. Other hormones may also play a role in the regulation of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such hormone is cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/&quot;&gt;Cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and testosterone form the key players in the “dual-hormone hypothesis,” that seeks to explain how empathy, aggression, dominance, and other social behaviours are controlled by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by Zilioli &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. examined whether the levels of testosterone and cortisol in the blood were associated with empathy in a group of university students. The students took a series of tests that included the RMET as well as the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a questionnaire designed to measure different aspects of empathy.  Saliva was collected for the analysis of cortisol and testosterone, and associations between hormone levels and RMET and IRI scores were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, testosterone levels were higher in men, and women scored higher on tests of empathy.  In women, there were no associations between hormone levels and empathy scores. However, an interesting association emerged between testosterone, cortisol and empathy in men, where an interaction between testosterone and cortisol was detected in relation to men’s IRI scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men with higher than average &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/08/how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-examine-my-brain/&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; levels, low cortisol predicted low empathy scores, whereas high cortisol predicted high empathy scores.  This association was not observed for men with testosterone levels below the mean, in whom cortisol showed no association with empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, a similar pattern emerged when they were grouped according to testosterone levels: women with low cortisol and high testosterone had reduced empathy scores.  However, these differences did not meet the cut-off for statistical significance, probably due to the smaller number of women than men in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high testosterone, low cortisol profile has been linked with competitiveness and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/02/19/human-aggression-and-violence-a-necessary-evil/&quot;&gt;aggressive behaviour&lt;/a&gt;.  This profile has also been associated with psychopathy, a mental condition defined by anti-sociality, egotism, and impaired empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men with high testosterone levels and high cortisol in this study displayed increased empathy.  What are the implications for real life behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The first author of a 2013 chemistry paper is objecting to his co-authors’ decision to retract the paper, which contains duplicated figures. We recently encountered a similar scenario with papers by first author Khalid Mahmood. In late 2015, Mahmood lost three papers in the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces over duplicated images. One of the notices […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything psychedelic drugs can’t do? A recent wave of scientific scrutiny has revealed that they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23457892&quot;&gt;elicit “spiritual” experiences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment&quot;&gt;alleviate end-of-life angst&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S2215036616300657.pdf&quot;&gt;treat depression&lt;/a&gt; – and they might achieve at least some of all this by “heightening consciousness”, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23982&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team at the University of Sussex, led by Anil Seth, co-director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, re-analysed existing magneto-encephalography (MEG) brain imaging data recorded from healthy people who had taken doses of either psilocybin (the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms), LSD or ketamine in the lab and then focused on their ensuing experience. MEG uses magnetic fields at the brain’s surface to identify patterns of neural activity – it’s very sensitive to changes from one moment to the next but not so accurate in terms of locating activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with people in a normal waking state, all the dosed-up volunteers, regardless of which drug they’d taken, showed a “sustained increase in neural diversity”. “During the psychedelic state, the electrical activity of the brain is less predictable and less ‘integrated’ than during normal conscious wakefulness – as measured by ‘global signal diversity’,” Seth explained in a press release from the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this unpredictability and diversity is greater in people who are awake (so who are conscious) than people who are asleep (who are not conscious), the data from people under the influence of psychedelics could be interpreted as signifying an even higher level of consciousness than is experienced during normal wakefulness, the team argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original brain scanning study (that produced the data analysed by the new paper) was led by Robin Carhart-Harris, at Imperial College, London. Carhart-Harris (who is listed a co-author on the new paper) has previously argued that his team’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020/full&quot;&gt;findings of greater “entropy”&lt;/a&gt; – greater disorder – in patterns of brain activity observed in people who had taken psilocybin could be interpreted as evidence in support of the claim that psychedelics can “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-7-2014-18-11-12&quot;&gt;expand consciousness&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they heighten it, and/or expand it, the new findings will feed into discussions about the medical and therapeutic uses of these drugs, including in treating PTSD and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S2215036616300657.pdf&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – though it’s still early days for this research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, Seth and colleagues reported a correlation between changes in the diversity of neural signals and the intensity of experiences – such as feelings of floating, of time being distorted, of a disintegration of the self and of sounds influencing vision – reported by the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, it’s not clear which specific changes in brain activity underpin which aspects of the psychedelic experience. But the researchers involved in the new paper are planning work to investigate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421.epdf&quot;&gt;Increased spontaneous MEG signal diversity for psychoactive doses of ketamine, LSD and psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Nuptial gift content regulates sex opportunities in South American spiders</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/15/nuptial-gift-content-regulates-sex-opportunities-in-south-american-spiders/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Spider-blog-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Females from nuptial gift-giving species usually obtain direct benefits in the form of food gifts by mating multiple times. This adaptive foraging strategy allows them to gather important resources to improve their survival and the number and/or success of their offspring. In such mating systems, females prefer males offering nutritious gifts and, therefore, males invest in such gifts as these confer access to more partners during the reproductive period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes males are not able to provide the gifts that females prefer, for instance if they have limited food available or low body condition. In such situations, males may decide to maximize their success by reducing the nuptial gifts cost, even if this is against females’ interest. Such is the case in spider species in which males´ gift-giving behaviour evolved into offering non-nutritious items, also known as worthless gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deception by offering worthless gifts has been described in the Palaearctic spider &lt;em&gt;Pisaura mirabilis,&lt;/em&gt; in which there is an occurrence of 38% in nature. As most of the gifts are nutritious, females follow the theoretical prediction and they mate with multiple males to increase their fecundity, especially when they are hungry. Indeed, females penalize males offering worthless gifts by reducing mating duration and the amount of sperm transferred, reducing the number of offspring produced with such males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what happens in mating systems where male deception via worthless gifts is the rule? That is the unique case of the Neotropical gift-giving spider &lt;em&gt;Paratrechalea ornata&lt;/em&gt; (Trechaleidae). This species is exceptional for studying sexual selection in relation to gift content, because 70% of nuptial gifts are worthless. In this species, females do not discriminate gift content before or during mating, and males offering worthless gifts are able to mate as successfully as males with nutritious gifts (similar frequencies of acceptances and similar mating durations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8969&quot; style=&quot;width: 4210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8969&quot; height=&quot;3129&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Spider-blog-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;4200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Female (left) and male (right) in the face-to-face position grasping the gift, during mating in &lt;em&gt;Paratrechalea ornata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;M.J. Albo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We predicted that in this scenario of high frequency of worthless gifts there should be little or no influence of hunger state on female receptivity. Following this prediction, we set up a laboratory experiment where we exposed well and poorly fed females to multiple matings with males offering nutritious or worthless gifts. This resulted in three experimental groups: well-fed females exposed to males offering nutritious gifts, well-fed females exposed to males offering worthless gifts and poorly fed females which could feed only from nutritious gifts offered by males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that all female groups had similar mating rates irrespective of feeding condition, and even poorly fed females did not significantly increase the number of matings with males offering nutritious gifts. Thus, as predicted, polyandry (i.e. a female mating with multiple males) doesn’t seem to be an adaptive foraging strategy in the Neotropical spider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How mating behaviour has changed over evolutionary time in this species is still unknown, but one possibility is that female receptivity may have changed due to evolution of male deception. Because seven out of ten males offer worthless gifts, females avoid mating as a foraging strategy. We propose that female receptivity depends on hunger in mating systems with mostly nutritious gifts but not in mating systems with a majority of worthless gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gift-giving spider mating systems are good models for studying how ecological conditions in interaction with sexual selection are shaping individual reproductive success. We know that male deception is correlated with prey availability and male body condition, and therefore linked to environmental variations. So, we are currently developing comparative studies considering different levels of male deception and ecological variations among species and populations. This will allow us to infer more general ideas on whether male deception may influence female receptivity and mating rate in gift-giving species.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A physics journal has retracted a 2011 paper by a group of scientists based in Italy, noting it’s “literally copied” from a paper by the same authors. This is the 12th retraction for the paper’s first author Alberto Carpinteri, who is known in the engineering community for championing some controversial ideas, such as that the Shroud […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The truth is that everyone is bored,” according to Albert Camus – but a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/17/2/359/&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Emotion&lt;/i&gt; gets beyond sweeping statements in the most comprehensive study of everyday boredom to date. The nationally-representative sample of 4000 American adults used an iPhone app to record their mood every waking half-hour, with boredom turning up in only three per cent of entries. When boredom was present, it was often mixed with other negative emotions, like loneliness and sadness, and rarely with positive ones. Surprisingly, boredom had a strong relationship with anger, which goes against the idea that boredom, itself low-arousal, cannot mix with more intense feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23938&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also broke down boredom demographically, and found people with lower income and less education were, on average, more likely to be bored than others, whereas women and married people were less likely to be bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These group differences might seem to back up the assertion of another author, GK Chesterton, who said “there are no uninteresting things, only uninterested people”. But Alycia Chin, collaborating with a team from  Carnegie Mellon University, found that a large chunk of the differences were explained by how different groups used their time. For instance, 30 per cent of the difference in boredom levels between men and women was accounted for by how much time they spent doing what turned out to be less boring activities – sports, exercise, personal grooming, time with friends and family – versus activities where boredom rates were higher, like study, working, and interacting with strangers. In other words, boredom may reflect what a person does with their time rather than being intrinsic to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, looking at the full range of variability in boredom levels recorded in the study, only 17 per cent of this variance was between participants, the rest was down to fluctuations in individual participants’ boredom from one moment to the next, reinforcing the idea that boredom is much less about who you are than about what you do. On the whole, it looks like we’re pretty good at keeping away from the shrugging, yawning side of life, but we do even better when free to do the things we want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/17/2/359/&quot;&gt;Bored in the USA: Experience sampling and boredom in everyday life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Beyond Slogans: After the March for Science Has Passed</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=7538</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/CQmCkEGHFuM/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/05/MFS-slogan-poster2-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;0000-0001-7318-5892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Science and democracy are logical allies, they both flourish with an open network of ideas, evidence and an uncompromising examination of results.” – Cindy Schaffer, former microbiologist with the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clever slogans, such as “May the Facts Be with You” or “There Is No Planet B” flourished at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Earth Day March for Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as scientists and supporters of science around the globe chanting “Less Invasions More Equations” and “All Six American Nobel Prize Winners Last Year Were Immigrants” took to the streets demanding attention to the tangible impact of science on humans “Do You Have Polio? Thank A Scientist” and the environment “Ice Has No Agenda, It Just Melts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is powerful for scientists and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/march-for-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;science-based organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to show how important scientific facts are to everyday life, irrespective of political alignment, but what happens to this momentum after the collective advocacy effort has passed? What difference does it make, many have asked, and what role should each of us play, considering daily professional and personal commitments and demands on our attention and time. These are the issues faced by every social movement in search of long-lasting tangible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Science Not Silence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official slogan of March for Science, “Science Not Silence,” is a phrase that has potential to propel advocacy beyond the day of the march. “Because the results of scientific research benefit our everyday lives, we have taken for granted that science would be a vital, respected part of discussions about societal issues that impact health, the environment, technology and other science-based issues,” says Erika Shugart, Executive Director at the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is no longer the case. If science is not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/advocacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;represented and advocated for&lt;/a&gt;, then it will be ignored or, even worse, replaced by discredited information,” she continues. “We can no longer be silent and assume science will be at the table, we must stand up for science.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My interpretation [of “Science Not Silence”] is that we need to use science and evidence-based scientific results to inform government policy and that we, as scientists, need to speak up about our research rather than staying silent,” says Elizabeth Blaber, Visiting Research Scientist at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASA Ames Research Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Mountain View. “More often than not, scientists get caught up in their research, writing grants and publishing papers; we forget that our results can really make a difference to the general population. We can use our results to help inform policymakers about important decisions that they need to make about climate policy, research funding, health care policies and the next step for NASA’s human exploration endeavors,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaber cites the unique insight scientists working as government contractors have into government science and the bureaucracy of government agencies. “Science not silence means education to us, educating policymakers on the importance of each scientific study that is being conducted in and outside of government agencies and how these studies collectively make all of our lives better in an unimaginable number of ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beyond the March&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we harness the excitement and momentum of the march and translate that into action is not a single solution for each scientist or scientific discipline. &lt;strong&gt;“When you ask ‘what next?’ that’s when I run into difficulty,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dan Schaffer, former &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Weather Research Software Engineer. “We can march every week all day long but in the end, there are far more important and difficult decisions we have to make if we are to do something significant about the issue of climate change, for example.” For some scientists, this means bringing scientific evidence into daily habits (and convincing others to do the same). “Here in Prius driving, solar panel powered Boulder, Colorado, folks like to talk about what we’re doing about climate change.” Yet some of these same climate scientists “fly as far as Australia for climate change conferences,” he says. “One round trip from Denver to London is equivalent to driving one of those Prius 9,000 miles. That trip to Sydney? 16,000 miles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Individual behavioral changes can, collectively, make an impact. March for Science provides easy opportunities on their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://satellites.marchforscience.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Week of Action page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, by clicking on ‘Science Connects Saturday’ (available everyday) you can send an email to your representatives just by filling in a few form fields. The relevant representative is determined automatically by your zip code entry. ‘Science Discovers Monday’ leads to suggestions for game night fun, science-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, follow up from the March for Science means being more open and emphatic, publicly, about what is evidence-based science and what is not. “As a former microbiologist at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-microbiology-laboratory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it disheartens me to hear that we have to prove that science matters,” says Cindy Schaffer. “The more active we, as scientists, can be in promoting real science,” she continues, “the better chance we will have for the false news to remain false in the general public’s mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message “Science Is Nonpartisan” took to the streets as a demonstration of “This Is What Democracy Looks Like.” These slogans call out for participation of the public in open, honest and constructive discussion. Says ASCB’s Shugart, “It is up to scientific societies and other organizations to help harness this energy to be a force for good in our communities.” Several organizations make it easy to participate, as we choose, in the democratization of science. Visit the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/march-for-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Stand Up for Science page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to learn how; email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:communications@plos.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;communications@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; if your professional association or society is taking action and wants to be listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/march-for-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand Up for Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Novel innovations, such as India’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i1202&quot;&gt;red line campaign&lt;/a&gt;, to reduce antibiotic consumption and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075550&quot;&gt;strides made by Mexico and Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in reducing their consumption were discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel prize winner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/barre-sinoussi-facts.html&quot;&gt;Françoise Barré-Sinoussi&lt;/a&gt; gave her thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eccmidlive.org/#resources/contemplating-an-end-to-the-hiv-epidemic-what-is-left-to-be-done&quot;&gt;what is left to be done to end the HIV epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. Although great progress has been made, since the discovery of HIV in the 1980s, in the treatment of AIDS and in reducing the spread of infections much more needs to be done. She particularly highlighted the need for basic science to underpin clinical research and the need to understand non-AIDS-related mortality in HIV-infected individuals. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging viruses, such as Zika and Ebola were the focus of a number of talks with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/janet-scott/&quot;&gt;Janet Scott&lt;/a&gt; discussing the difficulties faced by Ebola survivors, many of who suffer from mobility and ocular issues. Do we need to consider these conditions when providing therapy during the acute phase of illness, and could sepsis experts help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tropicalmed.eu/Page/WebObjects/PageTropE.woa/wa/displayPage?name=Team&quot;&gt;Zeno Bisoffi&lt;/a&gt; made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eccmidlive.org/#resources/strongyloides-hyperinfection&quot;&gt;impassioned plea&lt;/a&gt; for greater resources for the diagnosis and treatment of strongyloidiasis and encouraged involvement with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004898&quot;&gt;StongNet&lt;/a&gt; working group. It will be interesting to see the results of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42016054298&quot;&gt;ongoing systematic review&lt;/a&gt; that will provide information on the accuracy of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;molecular biology techniques for the diagnosis of &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/em&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally &lt;a href=&quot;http://pathology.ucsd.edu/faculty/pride.htm&quot;&gt;David Pride&lt;/a&gt; gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eccmidlive.org/#resources/human-respiratory-virome&quot;&gt;fascinating talk&lt;/a&gt; on the human respiratory virome and highlighted the differences in viral communities in health and disease states. Do these changes drive disease or are the viruses bystanders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks provoked as many questions as answers and made it clear this is a field constantly looking to the future and how we can do more to reduce the global burden of infectious diseases. We look forward to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eccmid.org/congress_information/eccmid_2018/&quot;&gt;ECCMID 2018&lt;/a&gt; to find out where we’re heading next.&lt;/p&gt;

This differs from garden variety &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malingering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;malingering&lt;/a&gt;, where an individual feigns illness for secondary gain (drug seeking, financial gain, avoidance of work, etc.). The primary goal in factitious disorder is to garner attention and sympathy from caregivers and medical staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The psychiatric handbook &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5&quot; title=&quot;DSM-5&quot;&gt;DSM-5&lt;/a&gt; identifies &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder#Types&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of factitious disorder: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self&lt;/b&gt; (formerly known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://munchausen.com/index.php/munchausen-syndrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Munchausen syndrome&lt;/a&gt; when the feigned symptoms were physical, rather than psychological).&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another&lt;/b&gt;: When an individual falsifies illness in another, whether that be a child, pet or older adult (formerly known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchausen_syndrome_by_proxy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Munchausen syndrome by proxy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the desire to elicit empathy is one of the main objectives in this disorder, it is odd indeed when the “patient” feigns a frightening or repellent condition. A recent report by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1556-4029.13340&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fischer et al. (2016)&lt;/a&gt; discussed a particularly flagrant example: the case of a middle-aged man who falsely claimed to be a sexually sadistic serial killer to impress his psychotherapist. Not surprisingly, his ruse was a complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1556-4029.13340&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt; noted that Mr. S had been a loner his entire life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt; ... He described having anxiety growing up, mainly in social situations. ... Mr. S had a history of alcohol abuse starting in his mid-twenties and continuing into his early forties. He denied any significant medical history. He denied legal difficulties, psychiatric hospitalizations, and suicide attempts. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;He was single, had never been married, had no children, and reported having only one close friend for most of his life. He never had a close long-term romantic relationship and stated a clear preference for living a solitary life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. S had served in the military but did &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;see combat, and afterwards worked the graveyard shift as a security guard (all the better to avoid people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;One year prior to his admission to the psychiatric hospital, Mr. S sought outpatient therapy for depression and engaged in weekly supportive psychotherapy with a young female psychology intern.&lt;/b&gt; His psychiatrist started an SSRI antidepressant and a low dose of antipsychotic medication for “depression with psychotic features.” Mr. S's alleged psychosis consisted of “voices” of crowds of people saying things that he could not make out, which he experienced while working the night shift. He consistently attended his therapy sessions and was noted to be making progress. However, several months into his therapy, Mr. S told his therapist that he had been involved in of military combat and described himself as a decorated war hero. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;After several therapy sessions in which he &lt;/b&gt;[&lt;i&gt;falsely&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;b&gt; recounted his combat experiences, Mr. S was queried as to whether he ever killed anyone, to which Mr. S replied, “During the military or after the military?” He then told his therapist that he had followed, raped, and killed numerous women during the 20 years since leaving the military.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recounted his imaginary crimes to the young female intern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. S reported that he would follow a potential female victim for several months before raping and strangling her to death with a rope. Although he claimed to rape and kill the women, he did not describe any sexual arousal from the subjugation, torture, or killing of his alleged victims. He refused to disclose how many women he had killed, where he had killed them, or how he had disposed of their bodies. He described having purchased various supplies to aid in abduction, which he kept in the back of his van while cruising for victims. These supplies included rope and two identical sets of clothes and shoes to help evade detection by the police. He described using various techniques to track his victims, as well as evade surveillance of his activities. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;He informed his therapist that he was actively following a woman he had encountered in a local public library several days earlier. Mr. S acknowledged that he studied the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi &lt;/i&gt;of famous sexually sadistic serial killers by reading books. The patient's therapist, feeling frightened and threatened by these disclosures, transferred his case to her supervisor, who then saw the patient for a few therapy sessions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Mr. S reported worsening depression, hearing more “voices,” and attempting to self-amputate his leg using a tourniquet. Consequently, Mr. S was involuntarily detained as a “danger to self” and “danger to others” for evaluation in the local psychiatric hospital.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified severity, with psychotic features. His routine physical, neurological exam, and lab work all yielded normal results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...The inpatient treatment team contacted the District Attorney's office in order to file for continued involuntary hospitalization due to the patient's homicidal ideation and history of violence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subsequent police investigation and review of records could not substantiate any of the patient's claims of committing multiple homicides in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the District Attorney accepted the application for the prolonged involuntary civil commitment (180-day hold), &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mr. S was confronted with the inconsistencies between his self-reported symptoms and objective findings and the failure to corroborate his claims of prior homicides. In response, Mr. S then confessed that he “had made the whole thing up…about the killings…all of it” because he “wanted attention.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He said that he had never followed, raped, or killed anyone and never had an intention to do so. He said that he did not know why he claimed this, other than an “impulse came over me and I acted on it.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His false identity as a serial killer backfired, and he couldn't understand why his therapist had discontinued their sessions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;He had believed that his feigned history and symptomatology would make him a “more interesting” patient to his therapist. He reported feeling rejected when his therapist transferred his care to her supervisor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. He had little insight into why his therapist may have been frightened by his behavior. Mr. S revealed that following his initial fabrications, and despite his initial involuntary hospitalization, he had felt too embarrassed to admit the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His original diagnosis was revised to “factitious disorder with psychological symptoms, and cluster A traits  (particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;characterized by emotional aloofness and solitary habits&quot;&gt;schizoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder&quot; title=&quot;characterized by severe social anxiety, paranoia, and often unconventional beliefs&quot;&gt;schizotypal&lt;/a&gt; traits) without meeting criteria  for any one specific personality disorder.” Because of these personality traits, he had no insight into why his therapist might feel threatened by his terrifying stories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are at least two other papers describing cases of factitious disorder with repugnant feigned symptoms: one reported a case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01804.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;factitious pedophilia&lt;/a&gt;, and the other reported a case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15515916&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;factitious homicidal ideation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tannahillglen/status/863123910103060481&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Tannahill Glen&lt;/a&gt; for the link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Forensic+Sciences&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1111%2F1556-4029.13340&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Factitious+Disorder+in+a+Patient+Claiming+to+be+a+Sexually+Sadistic+Serial+Killer&amp;amp;rft.issn=00221198&amp;amp;rft.date=2017&amp;amp;rft.volume=62&amp;amp;rft.issue=3&amp;amp;rft.spage=822&amp;amp;rft.epage=826&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.wiley.com%2F10.1111%2F1556-4029.13340&amp;amp;rft.au=Fischer%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Beckson%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Dietz%2C+P.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CAbnormal+Psychology%2C+Psychiatry&quot;&gt;Fischer, C., Beckson, M., &amp;amp; Dietz, P.
