	<title>Science News: Stone artifacts hint that humans reached the Americas surprisingly early</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089828</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-mexico-stone-artifacts-humans-americas-early</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans may have arrived in North America way earlier than archaeologists thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stone tools unearthed in a cave in Mexico indicate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2509-0&quot;&gt;humans could have lived in the area as early as about 33,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online July 22 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. That’s more than 10,000 years before humans are generally thought to have settled North America. This controversial discovery enters a new piece of evidence into the fierce debate about when and how the Americas were first populated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A paper like this one is really stirring up the pot,” says coauthor Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge. It “will no doubt get a lot of arguments going.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, archaeologists thought the Americas’ first residents were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-ice-free-pathway-americas-heats&quot;&gt;the Clovis people&lt;/a&gt; — big game hunters known for their well-crafted spearpoints who crossed a land bridge from Asia to Alaska about 13,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/8/18&lt;/em&gt;). Recent, well-accepted archaeological discoveries suggest that North America’s first settlers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-clovis-people-may-have-taken-tool-cues-earlier-americans&quot;&gt;actually arrived a few thousand years before&lt;/a&gt; the rise of the Clovis culture, by about 16,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/24/18&lt;/em&gt;), says Vance Holliday, an archaeologist the University of Arizona in Tucson not involved in the new work.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If the new finds really are human tools, Holliday says, this would be the oldest evidence for a human-inhabited site anywhere in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Chiquihuite Cave in central Mexico, archaeologists unearthed what appear to be over 1,900 stone tools. Using radiocarbon dating to determine the ages of charcoal, bone and other detritus surrounding the artifacts, the researchers determined that more than 200 of the tools were embedded in a layer of earth as old as 33,150 to 31,400 years. Other artifacts were found in a layer as fresh as about 13,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tools, excavated from 2016 to 2017, do not resemble Clovis technology or any other stone tools found in the Americas, the researchers say. This haul “has a lot of small blades and small flakes that were used for cutting,” says archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas in Mexico. His team also dug up squarish stone fragments that he suspects were used to make composite tools of some sort, assembled from pieces of rock stuck into wooden or bone shafts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are going to disagree about whether this qualifies as evidence” of human activity, says Loren Davis, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis not involved in the work. “These are rocks that were broken, but … people don’t have a monopoly on the physics involved with breaking rocks.” Davis says that a closer examination of the artifacts in person or via 3-D models could convince him that they are indeed relics of human craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben Potter, an archaeologist in Fairbanks, Alaska, affiliated with the Arctic Studies Center at Liaocheng University in China, is similarly “intrigued but unconvinced” that Chiquihuite Cave was an ancient human abode. He notes the crude shape of many of the artifacts, as well as the absence of other evidence — such as butchered animal remains or human DNA — that would peg the site as a human residence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mikkel Winther Pedersen sampling sediments in Mexico's Chiquihuite Cave&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089830&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/072120_mt_north-america_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089830&quot;&gt;Mikkel Winther Pedersen of the University of Copenhagen samples sediments in Mexico’s Chiquihuite Cave to search for traces of DNA. Finding human DNA would bolster the claim that the cave was home to ancient people, but the researchers have not yet found conclusive evidence for human DNA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089830&quot;&gt;Devlin A. Gandy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither the tools’ shape nor the apparent lack of other human-made remains disqualifies Chiquihuite Cave as an ancient dwelling, Ardelean says. He argues that archaeologists’ expectations of what North American stone tools should look like are overly influenced by the perfection of Clovis points, which were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-absorbing-spear-points-kept-early-north-americans-hunt&quot;&gt;neatly chipped from brittle stone&lt;/a&gt; such as jasper (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/14/17&lt;/em&gt;). The limestone used by the Chiquihuite Cave dwellers was more difficult to work with, he says, so it makes sense that these implements would be more rugged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for corroborating evidence of human activity, Ardelean expects human DNA to turn up only in specific areas of the cave, like where people ate or relieved themselves. He and his colleagues may not have excavated those spots yet, he says. The swath of ground investigated in this dig was also far from the mouth of the cave, where ancient people would more likely have cooked, eaten, thrown out garbage and performed other daily activities, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Edmonton “wasn’t a bit surprised” at the authors’ claim of 30,000-year-old human handiwork in Mexico. This cave joins a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-finds-put-humans-south-america-22000-years-ago&quot;&gt;sites in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; that have shown evidence of human occupation more than 20,000 years ago — although those reports remain controversial (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/13&lt;/em&gt;). To convince many archaeologists that humans really were in the Americas so early, “what you need is an accumulation of sites of that antiquity,” says Gruhn, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02137-3&quot;&gt;commentary on the new study&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there were humans in Mexico more than 30,000 years ago, that would affect what route they could have taken south from Alaska, says geologist Alia Lesnek of the University of New Hampshire in Durham. Archaeologists have thought that if humans arrived by about 16,000 years ago, they may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-americans-could-have-taken-coastal-route-new-world&quot;&gt;plodded south along the Pacific Coast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/30/18&lt;/em&gt;). That’s because a narrow, inland ice-free corridor between two ice sheets covering Canada would not have had enough plants or animals to sustain human travelers. But more than 30,000 years ago, those ice sheets had not yet reached their full extent, Lesnek says, opening up the possibility of inland migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Plant “Cognition” Deserves Greater Attention In Comparative Psychology, Paper Argues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39956</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/22/plant-cognition-deserves-greater-attention-in-comparative-psychology-paper-argues/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparative psychology is the study of animal behaviour, and its psychological underpinnings. But the term wasn’t always this restrictive. Until about 1935, plant behaviour also featured in texts in the field. Now Umberto Castiello at the University of Padua argues that it’s high time that plants regained their rightful place in the study of the psychology of non-human organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-38967-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Comparative Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Castiello gathers together a selection of recent evidence that plants can communicate, remember, recognise kin, decide and even count — “all abilities that one would normally call cognitive if they were observed in animals”. Far from being hard-wired, inflexible respondents to a changing world, they can adapt to change, benefit from classical conditioning, and even come to make predictions about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more than an improved understanding of plants at stake, writes Castiello: “As plants should be considered cognitive agents, as such, they offer us a unique opportunity for a comparative approach, which can potentially lead us to the ‘roots’ of cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39956&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants are clearly capable of all kinds of sensing — they can detect everything from changing levels of daylight to levels of the vital nutrient phosphorus in the soil, to signals from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to communication, plants have various methods at their disposal. Their sophisticated use of a suite of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) could be considered a language, as varying groups of VOCs can be used flexibly in new interactions and new contexts, Castiello argues. A combination of different VOCs allows the plant to transmit information about attack by a herbivore, or a more general wound, for example. There’s even &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.12340&quot;&gt;evidence for dialects among different species&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2012.3062&quot;&gt;plants that are more closely related understand each other better&lt;/a&gt;. This could mean that predator-attack signals would work to protect relatives more than unrelated plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for plant learning is also growing. For example, after being repeatedly dropped on the floor, &lt;em&gt;Mimosa pudica&lt;/em&gt; (often known as “sensitive plant” or “touch-me-not”) stops responding with its normal leaf-folding response to a shock — it comes to “realise” that being dropped on the floor is “normal” — but remains sensitive to other types of assault. Even more remarkably, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427&quot;&gt;a lab study &lt;/a&gt;found that garden pea seedlings can learn that a sudden increase in airflow, caused by a fan, is followed by the occurrence of (desirable) blue light, and will then grow towards the fan, even in the absence of light. This work demonstrates training by classical conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other research, pea plants have been found to make “decisions” that resemble those that a human would make. In this study, each plant’s roots were split between two different pots, one of which received a constant level of nutrients, the other a variable level. The overall level of nutrients in these pairs of pots was also varied, so that some pairs had high levels, and some low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In overall low-nutrient situations, the plants went for the safe option of the pot with the stable (if unsatisfying) level of nutrients, focusing root growth in this pot. But in higher nutrient conditions, they took a punt on the variable-level pot. As Castiello writes: “The experiment showed that plants are able to respond to risk and to switch to risk-prone or risk-averse behaviour depending on resource availability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castiello also outlines evidence that though plants will compete for resources, they can also support each other, exchanging nutrients via the mycorrhizal network of funghi, which connects tree root systems. As he reports, one study even found that Paper birch and Douglas fir trees growing together in a forest in British Columbia were aware when one was in need of help to dispose of excess carbon, and readily gave it. This kind of reciprocal generosity, based on need, to benefit all, looks very like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130860-400-the-kindness-paradox-why-be-generous/&quot;&gt;need-based giving observed in human societies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his paper, Castiello also considers research demonstrating that plants can learn the shape of a structure on which they’re growing and adapt to match, choose where to live (by directing their growth), cooperate with ants, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question should no longer be &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; plants are cognitive organisms but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; plants make use of their cognitive capacities,” Castiello writes. And as the work suggests that a complex, centralised brain  is not necessary for cognitive behaviour, it has implications for how we understand cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past century or so, research on plants has focused on their physiology. Castiello, for one, would like that to change. As he says, psychologists have a suite of tools and techniques available to study plant behaviour — and they are also in an ideal position to theorise about the mechanisms that underlie them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-38967-001&quot;&gt;(Re)claiming Plants in Comparative Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: This is the first picture of a sunlike star with multiple exoplanets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089815</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-picture-sun-like-star-multiple-exoplanets-astronomy-planets</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, an exoplanet family around a sunlike star has had its portrait taken. Astronomers used the Very Large Telescope in Chile to snap a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aba27e&quot;&gt;two giant planets orbiting a young star with about the same mass as the sun&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report July 22 in &lt;em&gt;The Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The star, called TYC 8998-760-1, is about 300 light-years away in the constellation Musca. At just 17 million years old, the planetary family is a youngster compared with the 4-billion-year-old solar system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets, most aren’t observed directly. Instead they are spotted as shadows crossing in front of their stars, or inferred as unseen forces tugging at their stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only a few tens of planets have been photographed around other stars, and just two of those stars have more than one planet. Neither is sunlike, says astronomer Alexander Bohn of Leiden University in the Netherlands — one is more massive than the sun, the other less massive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of this star’s planets are unlike anything seen in the solar system. The inner planet, a giant weighing 14 times the mass of Jupiter, is 160 times farther from its star than Earth is from the sun. The outer one weighs six times Jupiter’s mass and orbits at twice its sibling’s distance. In comparison, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-voyager-1-slips-interstellar-space&quot;&gt;Voyager 1 spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, which flew past the boundary marking the sun’s magnetic influence and into interstellar space in 2012, is still closer to the sun than either planet is to its star (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/12/13&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This exoplanet family could provide new insight into how solar systems can form. “As with many other exoplanet discoveries, this discovery makes us aware of other scenarios that we did not think of,” Bohn says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: A blood test may show which COVID-19 patients steroids will help — or harm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089822</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-blood-test-patients-steroid-treatment</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A cheap and easy blood test for inflammation may help determine which COVID-19 patients will benefit from getting steroids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an observational study of people hospitalized with COVID-19, those with high levels of an inflammation indicator called C-reactive protein in their blood had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/225402/hospital-medicine/effect-systemic-glucocorticoids-mortality-or-mechanical&quot;&gt;reduced chance of dying or being put on a ventilator&lt;/a&gt; when treated with steroids. But steroid treatment more than doubled the risk of needing a ventilator or dying for people with low levels of the inflammation-indicating protein, researchers report July 22 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Hospital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Steroids are Goldilocks drugs: They need to be given at the just right time,” says Luis Ostrosky, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston who was not involved with the work. Giving steroids too early may rein in the immune system too much so that it can’t effectively fight the coronavirus, leading to the virus doing more damage. And “if you give steroids too late, the damage is already done.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Using C-reactive protein as guide “may be the key to starting [steroids] at the right time,” Ostrosky says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A large clinical trial in the United Kingdom called the RECOVERY trial has shown that the steroid dexamethasone can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-dexamethasone-reduce-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths&quot;&gt;reduce the risk of death&lt;/a&gt; among COVID-19 patients who need extra oxygen or who are on ventilators (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/16/20&lt;/em&gt;). In that study, there was no benefit — and maybe a hint of harm — for patients who don’t need extra oxygen to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new results are in line with those from the RECOVERY trial and may help explain why some patients do better on steroids than others, Ostrosky says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shitij Arora, a hospital physician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, noticed in mid-March that some patients coming into the hospital with COVID-19 had intense inflammation in their lungs, while others didn’t. Arora treated a handful of patients who had lung inflammation with steroids and saw some of them dramatically improve.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Of course, that’s not a study. They’re anecdotes,” says William Southern, chief of the division of hospital medicine at Einstein and Montefiore. That was before dexamethasone had been shown to be helpful and after a study in China suggested COVID-19 patients might be harmed by steroids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some other doctors at the medical center were also prescribing steroids — usually prednisone, but sometimes methylprednisolone or dexamethasone — for some patients. So Southern, Arora and colleagues put together an observational study to see how COVID-19 patients fared when put on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arora hypothesized that a test for C-reactive protein might help doctors figure out which patients would benefit most. “It’s a cheap $20 test,” he says. Doctors started measuring the inflammation marker in the hospitals’ COVID-19 patients’ blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 1,806 patients in the study admitted to Montefiore’s four hospitals from March 11 to April 13, 140 were prescribed steroids. In 198 patients with levels of C-reactive protein of 20 milligrams per deciliter of blood or higher, steroid use reduced the chance of going a ventilator or dying by 77 percent, compared with those not taking the drugs. But in people whose C-reactive protein levels were 10mg/dL or lower, steroids increased the chance of death or ventilation by 2.64 to 3.14 times compared with those not taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Steroids are not appropriate for all. It’s just as important to avoid giving steroids to the people who may be harmed as it is to give steroids that may benefit,” Southern says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to use data collected in this study to determine whether tracking levels of C-reactive protein can also predict whether patients are recovering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: COVID-19 vaccines by Oxford, CanSino and Pfizer all trigger immune responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089811</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;More coronavirus vaccine candidates have passed initial safety tests and induce immune responses that might protect against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All volunteers in a small clinical trial who were given an experimental vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2931604-4&quot;&gt;made antibodies against a protein the virus uses to break into cells&lt;/a&gt;. Those participants also produced immune cells called T cells that are important for long-lived immunity, the researchers, working with the global pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, report July 20 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levels of neutralizing antibodies, which can block viral entry into cells, were at levels on par with those from people who have recovered from COVID-19. No serious side effects were seen, particularly when volunteers took acetaminophen after getting an injection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The results so far are encouraging,” says Mark Poznansky, a vaccinologist who directs the Vaccine &amp;amp; Immunotherapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the study. The researchers won’t truly know whether the vaccine is safe and effective until many more people get it.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Work on other viruses suggests that neutralizing antibodies and T cells in people’s blood should offer protection against infection or serious illness. But “a fundamental point about COVID-19 is that we don’t yet know what constitutes a protective [immune] response to the virus,” Poznansky says. “We’re not yet 100 percent clear about how those antibodies contribute to protection in the context of a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine starts with a chimpanzee adenovirus engineered so that it cannot replicate itself, making it safe to use. The virus can infect human cells, and delivers DNA instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein — the knobby protein studding the virus’s outer shell. Once inside a human cell, the DNA integrates, and the cell produces the spike protein, which the immune system then gears up to attack by producing antibodies and training white blood cells known as T cells to recognize the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This delivery system was used to make a still-experimental vaccine against the coronavirus behind MERS, so researchers at Oxford were able to quickly design the new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the clinical trial, more than 1,000 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 got either the new coronavirus vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or a vaccine against meningococcal bacteria. The meningococcal vaccine is safe and was used as a comparison group instead of a placebo so that volunteers got sore arms and other side effects that wouldn’t give away that they were in a comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Side effects to the coronavirus vaccine include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills and feeling feverish. Most of those were reduced when volunteers took acetaminophen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured levels of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of the participants using three different tests. Those tests all produced different absolute antibody counts, but, overall, showed that the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccine group were similar to levels seen in patients that had recovered from COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After one dose, 32 of 35 participants for whom data are available had neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein. After two doses, all 35 had the antibodies, the researchers found. How long any protection from those antibodies lasts is not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although most people made antibodies after a single dose of vaccine, the researchers plan to give two, high-dose injections in further efficacy trials. “We want to maximize our chance of getting an efficacious readout,” Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s Executive Vice President of BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;amp;D said July 20 in a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almost 200 vaccine candidates are in the works, with more than 20 in clinical trials around the world, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/#vaccines_intro&quot;&gt;a vaccine tracker&lt;/a&gt; maintained by the Milken Institute think tank. A vaccine candidate devised by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the biotechnology company Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people&quot;&gt;recently reported safety and antibody data&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). That mRNA vaccine candidate was the first to be tried in people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials of other vaccine candidates are finding similar promising results. CanSino Biologics Inc., a company based in China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety&quot;&gt;previously reported early safety data on its hybrid adenovirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/20&lt;/em&gt;). That vaccine has already been approved by the Chinese government for temporary use by its military. The company also reported data from a larger, Phase II safety trial of more than 500 volunteers on July 20 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. A high dose of the vaccine produced severe side effects such as fever in 9 percent of volunteers, but a lower dose produced a severe side effect in only 1 percent of people. Both types of doses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31605-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;stimulated antibodies and T cells&lt;/a&gt; against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And global pharmaceutical company Pfizer working with the German biotech company BioNTech also reported preliminary results July 20 at medRxiv.org of a 60-person clinical trial in Germany. Like an earlier U.S. study of the vaccine, the companies report that two doses of their mRNA vaccine appear safe and stimulate antibodies. The new study shows that the vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1&quot;&gt;also produces T cells&lt;/a&gt; against the coronavirus spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both CanSino and Pfizer say they will begin Phase III clinical trials to test for efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca and Oxford have committed to providing 2 billion doses of their candidate vaccine should it be shown to work. Phase III clinical trials to further test that vaccine’s efficacy have begun. In the United Kingdom, almost 10,000 volunteers have been vaccinated. In Brazil, a 5,000-person trial is under way, and a 30,000-volunteer trial is set to begin in the United States by the end of July. How soon scientists know how well the vaccine candidate works depends upon infection rates in communities where the studies are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the irony of ironies that where the virus spread is out of control may be the optimal place to test the vaccine,” Poznansky says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers need a sufficiently high infection rate to make sure that differences between vaccine and comparison groups is really due to protection from the vaccine and not just because the vaccinated volunteers never encountered anyone with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further results from these and other vaccine candidate front-runners may be known by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Religious People In The US — But Not Elsewhere In The World — Have More Negative Attitudes Towards Science</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39950</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/21/religious-people-in-the-us-but-not-elsewhere-in-the-world-have-more-negative-attitudes-towards-science/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a common view among the public — and certain intellectuals — that science and religion are in fundamental opposition to each other, despite claims to the contrary. As Richard Dawkins put it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-great-convergence-1.349210&quot;&gt;in his essay &lt;em&gt;The Great Convergence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “To an honest judge, the alleged convergence between religion and science is a shallow, empty, hollow, spin-doctored sham.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this conviction that science and religion cannot be reconciled comes down to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/yes-there-is-a-war-between-science-and-religion-108002&quot;&gt;belief that the two doctrines are &lt;em&gt;psychologically&lt;/em&gt; incompatible&lt;/a&gt;. How can someone put their faith in a divine being while also trying to make sense of the world through careful observation and hypothesis testing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620923239?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; casts doubt on the idea that religious people tend to be less scientifically-minded. Jonathon McPhetres from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colleagues find that while the link between religiosity and negative attitudes towards science is pretty robust in the United States, in other countries that relationship is very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39950&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team first explored Americans’ religiosity and attitudes towards science across a series of nine studies comprising more than 2,300 participants. Each study used the same measure of religiosity: participants rated themselves on six statements like “I believe in God” or “I consider myself religious”. But the studies varied in their approach to measuring participants’ stance on science. For instance, in some studies participants rated their own interest in scientific topics (e.g. robotics) vs neutral topics (e.g. music), while in others they responded to statements about their attitudes towards science (e.g. “The world is better because of science”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pretty much all of the studies, scores on the religiosity scale were negatively associated with scores on the science scales. That is, people who were more religious tended to have less interest in science, or more negative attitudes towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, these studies also included an experimental manipulation: some participants were first “primed” to think of religion, by listing reasons that religion is good, for instance, or by copying a snippet of text about religion. But this had no impact on the results, adding to other recent findings which have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;cast doubt on many priming effects&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so unsurprising. But would the same relationship hold up outside of the United States? To test this, the team conducted a couple of further studies. Firstly, they looked at data that had already been collected from a large, global survey. As part of that assessment, participants had rated their agreement with three items concerning science (e.g. “Science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable”), and had answered three questions about religiosity (e.g. “How important is religion in your life?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team looked at data from more than 66,000 participants across 60 countries. And, overall, they found a small negative correlation between religiosity and science attitudes. But this was far from consistent between the different countries: some nations showed positive correlations, while others showed no relationship between the two at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delve further into differences between countries, the team asked people from Brazil, the Czech Republic, the Philippines, South Africa, and Sweden to complete the same measures of interest in science and attitudes towards science as in the first set of studies.  This time — and in stark contrast to the American results — there were small positive correlations in each country: those who were more religious tended to be a little &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; interested in science and had &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that, for much of the world, rejection of science is not necessarily a feature of religion. Instead, the authors write, “apparent conflicts may be the product of other sociocultural and historical features of specific countries.” For instance, American Christianity has certain aspects of religious fundamentalism, such as a literal interpretation of the bible, and many political conservatives in the US have strong ties to the Christian right. These sorts of factors may help to explain why the country seems to have developed a unique conflict between science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other interpretations, of course: perhaps scientifically-minded Americans tend to reject religion, rather than the other way around. I also expect that some people would label the simultaneous holding of both scientific and religious views as “irrational”, and argue that the research says little about reconciling the two ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine — those kinds of philosophical arguments are unlikely to end any time soon. More interestingly to me, the study neatly illustrates the problem of relying solely on data from American participants (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/&quot;&gt;participants from other Western, industrialised societies&lt;/a&gt;) in psychological research. Whatever your take on the results, it’s clear that making sweeping generalisations based on such a narrow group can lead to stories about how we think and behave that are just not true for vast swathes of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620923239?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;Religious Americans Have Less Positive Attitudes Toward Science, but This Does Not Extend to Other Cultures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: How Yellowstone wolves got their own Ancestry.com page</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089787</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-genes-ancestry</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wildlife ecologist Jim Halfpenny was standing by the stone arch at the north entrance to Yellowstone National Park on January 12, 1995, when horse trailers eased through carrying the first wild gray wolves to enter the park in about 60 years. Delivered from Canada, these wolves were the beginning of a historic attempt to complete and restore the park’s ecosystem by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/epic-yellowstone-captures-thriving-ecosystem-world-famous-park&quot;&gt;reintroducing a species&lt;/a&gt; wiped out decades before (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/17/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He remembers that the schoolchildren who had gathered were disappointed to see only trailers, with not even a glimpse of fur. However, Halfpenny and the other elated adults “were up there howling our heads off,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the region was pro-wolf, though. Seven of the 41 genetic founders of Yellowstone’s &lt;em&gt;Canis lupus&lt;/em&gt; population introduced that year and the next ended up being shot illegally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep cultural memory entangles wolves and wilderness in all their terror and majesty. In Europe’s bouts of bubonic plague, “there would be people standing on the fortress walls watching their parents being eaten by wolves because they had died and been thrown out,” Halfpenny says. Yet wolves also tug heartstrings as cousins of humankind’s beloved dogs. In surveys of the Yellowstone’s winter visitors, “the No. 1 thing they want to see is the wolf,” he says. “In the summer, it’s bear, then the wolf.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jim Halfpenny&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089790&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071020_sm_wolves_inline2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089790&quot;&gt;Out in the Yellowstone woods, wildlife ecologist Jim Halfpenny (grizzly bear skull cast in hand) has followed the fates of wolves and other charismatic species. He encourages people to keep an eye out for rare mammals and teaches professional-grade forensic tracking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089790&quot;&gt;Larry Marlow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of the reintroduction, Halfpenny was teaching about wolves and other wildlife for his own company, A Naturalist’s World, while still working with the University of Colorado’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research in Boulder.  From the beginning, as he recorded the introduced wolves’ pairings, puppies and the rise and fall of packs, he wished Yellowstone visitors and other passionate wolf fans also could follow the story lines. Then it hit him: “People have Ancestry.” The genealogy website Ancestry.com, he thought, could introduce wolves as the first nonhuman section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that’s what he and four dedicated coworkers eventually created in four intense months of data wrangling. A single chart of pack genealogy with biographical sketches could take weeks. It’s still being updated, and anyone can find a wolf’s history at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wolfgenes.info/&quot;&gt;wolfgenes.info&lt;/a&gt; and (scrolling down the page) can request an invitation to get a free account to view the wolf family trees on the Ancestry.com website. The Yellowstone Wolf Genealogy site’s media gallery includes images of many of the wolves along with life stories and family trees. Halfpenny and two coauthors also present that data, and those stories, in a 2020 book celebrating the 25th anniversary of howling as the trailers arrived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Canadian-born female known as 5Fg, for instance, was the first wolf carried out of the trailers in Yellowstone and set free into the wild in March. The next year she lost her mate and their four recently born pups in an attack by a rival pack. The raiders hurt her, too, but another survivor helped feed her, and she recovered to found a new pack with him. The Canadian female 9Fb also lost her first mate (illegally shot) but was accepted, with her eight pups, by another transplanted Canadian, a rather young male. He often played with the pups, letting them sneak up and leaping to his feet only at the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wapiti wolf pack&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089789&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071020_sm_wolves_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089789&quot;&gt;The Wapiti alpha female, with her white fur, has just returned to a cluster of her offspring including a laggard heading toward the scrum. The back of the alpha male, her mate, is barely visible in the boisterous reunion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089789&quot;&gt;Julie Argyle/Wild Love Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these step-pups ranks among Halfpenny’s favorite wolves, 21Mb, the star of three National Geographic specials. “The biggest day for me,” Halfpenny says, came when 21Mb as a young adult decided to approach a pack that had just lost its alpha male (another illegal shooting). An edgy standoff dragged on for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually one female checked him out, and “finally she put one paw on his back,” Halfpenny says. After that turning point, he was on his way to acceptance and became the alpha wolf. His biography describes him as a wolf that humans can admire: “As far as we know, he never lost a fight, and he never killed a vanquished wolf from an enemy pack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For new visitors who want a glimpse of wolf life themselves, Halfpenny has some counter-intuitive advice: Don’t watch for wolves. Watch for people. The longtime passionate wolf-watchers of Yellowstone gather just as night ends where they think wolves are likely to be. If all the spotting scopes are trained in one direction, “that’s a good sign.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-stumbled-across-first-known-manganese-fueled-bacteria</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered the first bacteria known to use the metal manganese to grow. And the researchers had to look only as far as the office sink.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely an interesting story about serendipity,” says Jared Leadbetter, an environmental microbiologist at Caltech. He and Hang Yu, also an environmental microbiologist at Caltech, report their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2468-5&quot;&gt;fortuitous find&lt;/a&gt; in the July 16 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadbetter had been working with a pink compound called manganese carbonate in a glass jar. After having trouble cleaning the jar, he filled it with tap water and left it to soak. When he returned 10 weeks later, after an out-of-town teaching stint, the contents of the jar had transformed into a dark, crusty material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadbetter knew that scientists had long suspected that bacteria could use manganese to fuel growth. Over a century ago, researchers discovered that bacteria could borrow electrons from chemical elements like nitrogen, sulfur, iron — and manganese. In some cases, bacteria could even use these electrons to fuel growth in much the same way that humans use electrons from carbohydrates in the diet for energy. But no one had identified bacteria that could turn electrons from manganese into energy.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When bacteria do borrow electrons from manganese, they convert the metal to a dark material called manganese oxide. Manganese oxide is found all over the planet — from deposits in Earth’s crust to the seafloor to drinking water. And, as it turned out, in Leadbetter’s glass jar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He wondered if the bacteria that had oxidized his manganese might be the elusive species that actually use manganese to grow. “Maybe I better not pour this down the sink,” he thought.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadbetter and Yu first identified about 70 bacterial species in the jar, which likely came from the tap water. The pair then isolated two bacterial species that, when present together, generate manganese oxide. Given manganese carbonate, these bacteria multiplied exponentially. As the bacterial population size increased, the rate of manganese oxide production increased along with it, suggesting that the bacteria were using manganese as fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team dubbed the newly identified species ‘&lt;em&gt;Candidatus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Manganitrophus&lt;/em&gt; noduliformans’ and &lt;em&gt;Ramlibacter lithotrophicus&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers don’t yet know the exact role of each species. Both might be integral in generating energy from the manganese or one could be the main driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Epifluorescence microscope image of manganese bacteria&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089772&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071620_cb_manganese_inline_mobile_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089772&quot;&gt;Epifluorescence microscopy captures two newly discovered bacterial species (in magenta and green) on manganese oxide. Researchers don’t know yet whether the species work together to generate energy from manganese or whether one is just along for the ride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089772&quot;&gt;H. Yu and J.R. Leadbetter/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings could help researchers manage manganese oxide that pollutes drinking water, says Amy Pruden, an environmental scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved in the study. “Now that we have an idea of who the manganese oxidizers are, we can start looking for them in drinking water systems and maybe we can find better controls.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadbetter suspects that similar bacteria may also be responsible for grapefruit-sized balls of manganese oxide on the ocean floor, first spotted in the 1870s, that have puzzled scientists. He wants to search there and other places for more examples of bacteria that use manganese for energy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Let’s see if we can find these organisms in other environments,” Leadbetter says. “Not just my sink.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Coronavirus-infected cells sprout filaments that may spread the virus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089801</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-infected-cells-sprout-filaments-spread-virus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Like a scene out of a sci-fi movie, cells invaded by the coronavirus can sprout probing appendages bedecked with viral bits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30811-4&quot;&gt;formed more numerous and longer extremities, called filopodia&lt;/a&gt;, than uninfected cells, researchers report online June 28 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. High-resolution electron microscopy confirmed the presence of these filopodia in infected monkey cells and captured SARS-CoV-2 viral particles budding from the projections.  These protrusions may have unexplored roles in spreading the virus, and could serve as targets for future antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar spindly projections are found on some healthy cells, where the structures serve different roles. Repair cells, for example, send out filopodia to detect chemical cues to navigate to wound sites.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Other viruses, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mbio.asm.org/content/5/4/e01340-14#ref-40&quot;&gt;coronavirus behind the SARS epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, also can cause cells to sprout filopodia. Some viruses, such as Marburg and Ebola, travel along filopodia of infected cells and may use the structures to move directly from one cell to another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The extensions “are highways for transport,” says Robert Grosse, a cell biologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SARS-CoV-2-infected cell with filopodia&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089802&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071620_ja_filopodia_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089802&quot;&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause infected cells to produce hairlike projections that extend away from their surfaces (colored white in this fluorescence microscopy image of a pair of human colon cells) that may play a role in the virus’ spread in the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089802&quot;&gt;Robert Grosse/CIBSS/University of Freiburg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More work is needed to confirm what role filopodia play in a COVID-19 infection. Microscopy of infected cells over time would provide insight into whether these cell-to-cell connections affect viral spread, says Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The filopodia observed in the new study contained a protein called CK2. Cells dosed with silmitasertib, a CK2-inhibiting molecule in clinical trials for various cancers, were more resistant to a SARS-CoV-2 infection than untreated counterparts. That suggests that CK2 could be a target for future &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs&quot;&gt;coronavirus drug treatments,&lt;/a&gt; Grosse says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/10/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: 50 years ago, NASA prepared to launch America’s first space station</title>

	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-nasa-launch-america-first-space-station-skylab</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cover of  Science News, July 4, 1970&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089461&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_50ya_cover-138x186.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power for Skylab&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/aerospace-55&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;, July 4, 1970&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The largest solar cell array system for electrical power ever devised for a spacecraft is now being completed…. The solar array will be used for the workshop and telescope components of the Skylab cluster to be launched as a space station forerunner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One might think Skylab was cursed. Astronauts there made unprecedented observations of Earth and the sun, and set new records for time spent in space — but many misfortunes befell the early NASA space station. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/troubled-skylab-mission-jeopardy&quot;&gt;Skylab’s May 1973 launch&lt;/a&gt; damaged its solar panels. Astronauts, who arrived on their first mission to the station about two weeks later, salvaged one panel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/eventful-first-week-space-crew-skylab&quot;&gt;but not without a lot of frustration&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/2/73, p. 352&lt;/em&gt;). E­quipment failures plagued a second and third mission, and NASA abandoned the station in early 1974. But the space agency’s Skylab problems were far from over. Despite NASA’s efforts to keep the station in orbit, Skylab broke up in Earth’s atmosphere in 1979 and scattered debris across Western Australia. Luckily, no one got hurt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Who Crave Structure Are More Likely To Declare That Errors In Media Reports Are “Fake News”</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39945</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/20/people-who-crave-structure-are-more-likely-to-declare-that-errors-in-media-reports-are-fake-news/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been much interest in what drives fake news over the last few years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/11/fake-news-leaves-a-particularly-lasting-impression-on-the-less-smart/&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; exactly shares it, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/16/most-people-who-share-fake-news-do-care-about-the-accuracy-of-news-items-theyre-just-distracted/&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt;? But beyond &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; fake news — that is, purposefully misleading information spread online to further a particular agenda — recent years have also seen many people labelling genuine journalism as untrustworthy or downright false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious ideological drivers to this, with some keen to undermine political opponents by any means necessary. But there might be another reason people are drawn to declaring “fake news!”: a need for order&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewing publications as susceptible to honest mistakes or human error implies a world in which information can be distorted for unpredictable reasons; viewing them as deliberately and methodically deceiving readers for sinister reasons, on the other hand, implies some sort of order. It therefore follows that those who crave structure may also be more likely to deem articles false, suggest Jordan R. Axt from McGill University and colleagues in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620922785&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39945&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To test this theory, the team asked participants how much they agreed with statements measuring their personal need for structure (e.g. “I enjoy having a clear and structured mode of life” and “It upsets me to go into a situation without knowing what I can expect from it”). Participants also reported their political affiliation, from very conservative to very liberal, before receiving information about errors in news reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One piece of writing stated conservative news media was more likely to publish news stories that were later retracted; the other claimed the opposite, citing the liberal media as making more retractions. Participants were randomly assigned to either condition, meaning some saw material consistent with their own ideology (e.g. a Democrat reading that the conservative media makes more retractions) while others saw ideologically &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;consistent material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who read ideologically consistent material were more likely, as you’d expect, to indicate that media outlets were &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; deceiving readers rather than making honest mistakes. More interestingly, those who had a higher personal need for structure were also more likely to believe something was intentionally faked (for Democrats, this was even true when they read about retractions by the liberal media). Conservatives also had a higher need for structure and a higher level of belief in deception than liberals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further study, participants completed the same measures before being shown a scenario which didn’t mention retractions, but rather stated that researchers had found an “alarming number of potentially misleading or inaccurate stories”. Democratic participants read that these stories had been published by &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;, while Republicans read that they originated on &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. A second version of the study used specific examples: Democrats read about a debunked &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; report on Hunter Biden, while Republicans read about a heavily criticised &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; article about Trump’s relationship with the Ukrainian president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, participants’ need for structure was not, overall, significantly associated with their perceptions that the media had intentionally deceived readers. However, when the team looked at Republican and Democratic participants separately, they found that this association did exist among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final study, participants wrote either about a recent event in their life that was uncontrollable, or about something that had happened that they could control. They were then shown the ideologically consistent scenario suggesting high rates of retractions among news outlets with opposing political views to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed, again, a correlation between need for structure and perception of intentional deception in Republican (but not Democratic) participants. Interestingly, participants who had written about feeling out of control were also more likely to believe the media was purposefully misleading people than those who had written about a controllable event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly important point. If making people feel out of control can drive them to declare news as fake, then perhaps interventions could be developed to &lt;em&gt;improve &lt;/em&gt;feelings of control among populations thought to be particularly likely to feel less in control: older people, for instance, or those occupying “low status” positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study suggests that a need for structure has a significant impact on someone’s likelihood to call something fake news — an effect that was particularly strong for Republicans.  To mitigate this, the team suggests a goal of “guiding people towards trusting all news sources” — an idea they do admit is somewhat unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem unlikely. There will never be consensus around certain political issues, and those occupying different positions on the political spectrum are likely to continue ascribing “truth” and “lies” to fundamentally different viewpoints. Increasing media literacy, as the team suggests, might help: ensuring people know the difference between reporting and opinion, for example. But there’s one more unfortunate truth that the team doesn’t acknowledge — some news sources simply aren’t trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620922785&quot;&gt;The Psychological Appeal of Fake-News Attributions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18278</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FHwtiShXfjs/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Black Lives Matter movement in the US and elsewhere has rightly brought about a much-needed reexamination of deeply rooted issues around diversity and equity for minorities and marginalized populations. Structural racism and other inequities, for example around gender or status, continue to affect academia world-wide. At PLOS we recognize that we can do better — our journals can and must play a role in addressing concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are not new concerns, and we have been working to make our journals a home for diverse voices. However, we recognize that we need to step up our efforts in a number of areas and commit to doing so. For our journals, this means:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will &lt;strong&gt;assess and survey the diversity of our contributors&lt;/strong&gt;, from the thousands of Academic Editors handling submissions at our journals to our authors and reviewers. This will establish a baseline and allow us to hold ourselves accountable for making measurable positive changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;improve the diversity of our journals and their leadership&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes our internal staff but also our Academic Editors appointed to senior roles. We need to ensure that our journals are representative of broader society as well as the academic community, and that the voices of different communities or groups of researchers are heard and play an integral role in our journals. We commit to proactively seeking out underrepresented communities to redress the balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will continue our efforts to &lt;strong&gt;ensure that all manuscript handling processes are set up to recognize and minimize bias&lt;/strong&gt;. We are reflecting internally on how we can improve our understanding of these issues and minimise any of our own biases, and will work with our Academic Editors and peer reviewers to address any form of bias against authors or their origin in the handling of submitted manuscripts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the scope of each of our journals we &lt;strong&gt;aim to be a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;publishing platform for research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations&lt;/strong&gt;. In doing so, we need to ensure that the study of these populations recognizes the problem of racism and inequalities, and that the topic is covered appropriately in published papers. We need to be mindful of inappropriate discussions of race in relationship with genetics traits for example. Inequalities and racism do affect the well-being of minority populations, and this needs to be considered in public health research settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the obligation to continue to &lt;strong&gt;uphold the highest standards of ethics&lt;/strong&gt;. Research about minorities or other affected populations needs to be conducted to the highest editorial standards and ethics guidelines, and should award credit to contributors from these communities as appropriate.  We will not publish research intended to directly support oppression or persecution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these commitments are items that we will be able to address swiftly, whereas others will take more time to achieve. This topic will therefore be a regular feature on PLOS Blogs, so watch this space. We are committed to pursue these activities in the short as well as long term, and to facilitate change not just at PLOS’ journals, but also in the broader academic community where possible. We count on your support in this endeavor and will appreciate any feedback, help or suggestions for specific actions to take. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Early Sharing: Should You Take the Plunge?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18262</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/NF4WPlV1nKw/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;What does early sharing accomplish?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientific discovery is a process of continuous vetting and refinement. While immediate access to the latest findings allows for accelerated discoveries, sharing early and transparently also results in more checkpoints throughout the research process for communities to provide feedback. The need for effective and time-sensitive global collaboration has been further emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting early sharing practices helps ensure your research is available as soon as it’s needed, regardless of your field. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing allows for the latest research to be connected without waiting for the final publication. Whether it’s through a preprint, open data set, or accessible protocol, researchers are empowered to cite the latest discoveries in their current research. Learning how and when researchers have adopted early sharing is the first step to contributing to this global movement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before the Study Takes Place&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research question being pursued and the resulting study design create the foundation of a research project. These core elements are often internally reviewed to ensure the resulting study is as sound and focused as possible, but the greater research community typically doesn’t see the methodology of a study until the results and conclusions are published. By preregistering your study protocol early, you enable broader research assessment to begin at the foundation of a study. The study design itself goes through peer review so that potential improvements or flaws are detected before the study actually takes place. When the final research article is ready to be assessed, editors can consider the study’s rigor and adherence to the study design.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help ensure a study follows the highest standards and has long-term reproducibility, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; both offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration options&lt;/a&gt;. Preregistration can help reduce confirmation bias of editors and reviewers by confirming the underlying validity of your research. Additionally, having your protocol published allows others to pursue your study, or to tweak your design to fit their available resources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Initial Findings&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; announced two new &lt;a href=&quot;https://biologue.plos.org/2020/04/14/new-linked-article-types-enable-researchers-to-publish-findings-as-their-work-progresses/&quot;&gt;linked articles types&lt;/a&gt;: Discovery Reports and Update Articles. To alleviate the pressure of having to wait for a fully formed story to develop, Discovery Articles give researchers the flexibility to publish novel initial findings and as a first step. Once the Discovery Report is published, both the original authors and other research groups can augment the initial report by submitting Update Articles for review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As multiple Update Articles can be linked to a single Discovery Report, your initial finding can spring into a series of interconnected advancements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before Publication&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preprints provide a platform for open, public review that is independent from a journal and doesn’t depend on an invitation from the editor. While the original preprint can be viewed and cited prior to publication, the preprint can be updated as the manuscript is revised to ensure the most recent version of your paper is always available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS makes the interaction between preprint servers and our journals as simple as possible. You can directly submit your preprint to our journals from medRxiv and bioRxiv, or you can include the DOI of your preprint on the submission form if you used a different server. For those in other subjects, there is an ever-growing collection of active &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers&quot;&gt;preprint servers&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, authors of life science articles can opt-in to have the paper uploaded to bioRxiv during submission, without any additional work. Our editors are encouraged to consider comments left on a preprint, allowing for the open review platform that preprints provide to potentially accelerate and deepen the review process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, open and accessible data sets are another opportunity to collaborate among far-spanning researchers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/a-selfish-reason-to-share-research-data/&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that publications that link to data in a repository are cited more frequently on average. As many researchers around the world don’t have access to the infrastructure required to generate their own data sets, making your data available without restrictions is an easy way to ensure your research is maximizing its contribution and usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing opens up opportunities throughout the research process to share study designs, initial findings, and data at a global scale. Involve your communities with early sharing practices so that vetting happens throughout the research process, ultimately improving the credibility of your final research output.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of the same groups of individuals known to suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes are faring especially poorly during this pandemic. In many ways, the disparate outcomes being documented in COVID-19 are simply offering a magnified view of longstanding health inequities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html#:~:text=means%20is%20lacking.-,What%20is%20health%20equity%3F,be%20as%20healthy%20as%20possible.&quot;&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&lt;/a&gt; stated that “&lt;em&gt;Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy&lt;/em&gt;“. To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed. Socially disadvantaged people, who have been historically marginalized and/or disfavored by social and political institutions, have faced significant obstacles to health equity in the midst of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html&quot;&gt;Social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, a key recommendation for preventing the spread of COVID-19, has proven to be very difficult for socially disadvantaged persons. Housing insecurity and homelessness are established risk factors for chronic health conditions, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/4/241&quot;&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;. In the setting of COVID-19, these challenges have meant that many individuals cannot feasibly maintain the recommended physical distance from others. Further, for people in service professions that require they interact daily with the public, their ability to socially distance has also been quite challenged. Racial and ethnic minorities and low income persons are overrepresented in such professions, which has increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who have sought testing for COVID-19, inequities in health care access and services have been on full display. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases?t=1595235018970&quot;&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; noted that African Americans patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. cough and fever) were less likely to be given a COVID-19 test than were white persons with the same symptoms. This type of biased delivery of health services can lead to socially disadvantaged individuals presenting later (e.g. for hospitalization) with severe symptoms or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/beloved-brooklyn-teacher-30-dies-coronavirus-denied-covid/story?id=70376445&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.  As vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are developed and disseminated, individuals who have directly, or vicariously, experienced bias in the health care setting may be reticent to seek these options, out of fear of inequitable treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to shortages of food in many communities due to store closures as well as bulk purchases by individuals who can afford to do so. Low-income communities have been particularly affected. A consequence of structural inequities including residential segregation, food access is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379708007290?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;known to vary&lt;/a&gt; by community demographics. In this pandemic, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, may be exacerbated, particularly for persons facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638616306722&quot;&gt;food insecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/04/07/game-plan-to-help-those-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-171863&quot;&gt;Solutions&lt;/a&gt; for addressing the inequities magnified by COVID-19 have been offered and include expanding access to testing and health care, and providing social services to keep vulnerable groups safe. People with kidney diseases are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Because many are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30899864/&quot;&gt;socially disadvantaged&lt;/a&gt;, it will be important to evaluate and expand the services they are provided, including those addressing social needs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/word-clous-april-highlights-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorectal cysts: A simple model system for testing the efficacy of CAR-T cells against malignancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimal CAR T therapy validation requires a 3-D cellular system that mimics the complex tumour cellular architecture. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Dillard et al. report the development of colorectal cysts from a single colorectal cell line Caco-2 as simple and reliable tools to validate CAR T-mediated therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12039&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12039 &quot; height=&quot;306&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fig-1-300x191.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Method principle, taken from the original publication.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR T cells are T lymphocytes, genetically engineered to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) on their surface that recognizes CD19 marker on the surface of B lymphocytes and also promotes signalling events that control the activation of lysis. This results in the destruction of the B lymphocyte. Since CD19 is a widespread marker in cancerous B cells, CAR-T cells are being used as an allogenic treatment of B-cell malignancies.  The CAR T-mediated immunotherapy for cancer has revolutionized the treatment of ‘liquid tumors’, i.e, haematological, however, it hasn’t been so effective in the treatment of solid tumors, as CAR-T cells are unable to survive in the complex tumour microenvironment and target successfully all the tumor-generating cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, using a two-dimensional (2-D) cellular system, in which CAR-T cells are added in a monolayer of cultured target cancer cells, to validate CAR-T cell functionality and specificity, is inadequate, as the 2-D system does not mimic the challenging 3-D morphology and organization of solid tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cancer cells acquire a different gene expression profile when cultured in 3-D spheroids compared to 2-D, which may affect their recognition by CAR-T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to create a simple 3-D cellular system that could be used for the validation of CAR-T cells, the authors took advantage of a colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2, that has been shown to form 3-D cyst-like structures by self-organisation, with the apical surface of the epithelial cells facing a central lumen. First, they transduced Caco-2 cells with the &lt;em&gt;CD19&lt;/em&gt; gene, in a way that ensured cell-surface expression of the CD19 antigen on their surface (CD19Caco-2 cells). Next, they showed that CD19CAR-T cells were able to kill CD19Caco-2 cells, as effectively as in a 2-D culture, while Caco-2 cells remained intact. Finally, they demonstrated that the system was compatible with super-resolution microscopy, high-throughput live imaging and bioluminescence assays; hence the ability of the CAR-T cells to kill the cancer cells and destroy the cyst can be monitored with both qualitative and quantitative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple and versatile method that can be adapted to the use of a variety of cancer lines that have been shown to form similar simple 3-D structures. It could therefore, constitute a powerful tool for the therapeutic validation of CAR-T cells in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar disease is prevalent in homeless people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerous studies have shown that bipolar disease (BD) is a common disorder among homeless people. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08819-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Ayano et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by pulling existing data from the literature, which confirmed and estimated more accurately the high pooled prevalence of BD among homeless people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BP) is a mental health condition characterized by lengthy periods of extreme mood swings. BP has a prevalence of about 1-2.4 % in the general population, but has been shown to affect 2.41 to 42.42% of homeless people, depending on the study. BD has a severe negative effect in homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of disability, substance/drug abuse. In order to provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice, the authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. From a total of 3236 articles identifies, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted. The studies were performed in five countries/continents (Canada, USA, Brazil, Germany, Ireland and France) and were published between 2001 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the random-effects model to account for existing heterogeneity the pooled BD prevalence among homeless people was estimated at 11.4%. Subgroup analysis by country/continent showed the prevalence of BD to be 10% in Europe and 13.2 %  in other countries, while subgroup analysis by the quality of the studies showed a pooled BD prevalence of 9.9% for high-quality studies and 11.8% for both low and moderate-quality studies. These numbers are significantly higher than the ones reported for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12034 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/homeless-person-HL-blog-July-2020-300x270.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely reasons for this increased between BD and homelessness is the co-occurrence of other medical conditions, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, which have been associated with an increased risk of bipolar and other mental illnesses. Also, the possible exposure of homeless people to physical and sexual trauma, which is associated with the onset of manic episodes and bipolar disease in risky groups, may also be a factor. Moreover, the higher co-existence of depression, anxiety, psychosis and alcohol-related disorders in homeless people may also constitute a possible reason for the higher prevalence of BD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the importance of further high-quality studies to determine the etiologies of the high prevalence of BD observed in homeless people and of targeted interventions to prevent and diagnose BD in these individuals. The authors recommend the strengthening of the mental health services for homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating committed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of the shipping industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shipping industry has one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions and needs to take action to reduce such emissions as soon as possible. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bullock et al. analyses for the first time the committed emissions of the shipping sector taking into consideration individual ship type data from existing and new ships and assesses which measures should be taken to reduce baseline committed emissions to meet the Paris agreement goals for action on climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris agreement goal is to keep the increase of global temperature below 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. For this to be achieved global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions need to be reduced as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping sector is the main contributor of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, estimated at around 800 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year, hence it has set a target of at least 50% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 2050 compared to 2008.  However, until now the committed emissions of shipping, i.e., the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions expected based on existing energy infrastructure, are based on assumptions of ship lifetimes extrapolated from other transport systems. The average scrappage age of ships is 28 years, which is much higher than road transport vehicles, therefore, this practice underestimates committed emissions in shipping. As a result, the ‘carbon budget’, which is the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that can be emitted over time while limiting global warming to the accepted levels of the Paris agreement for shipping industry is estimated to be higher for the shipping industry, than it really should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study the authors analysed committed emissions in 11,000 existing and new ships in the European Union’s new emissions monitoring scheme (EU MRV), taking into account the wide range of ship types, as well as their different sizes and scrappage age, using datasets published for the first time in 2019. It was found that five ship types: container, bulk carriers, ro pax, oil tankers and passenger ships are responsible for 71% of committed emissions, with the highest baseline committed emissions estimated for container ships. In particular, the new containers account for the highest committed emissions, as although they are more efficient, they are much larger than older containers and this has a greater impact. Moreover, passenger ships were found to have disproportionately high emissions, despite their small numbers, due to their long life time. Overall the baseline committed emissions from all existing ships in the EU MRV fleet was found to be 2260 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, much larger than estimated in previous studies. This is equivalent to 85-212% of the carbon budget to achieve the 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C target that is available for the EU MRV fleet, therefore, significant mitigation measures are required to reduce these figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12040&quot; style=&quot;width: 428px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12040&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/fig4-300x257.png&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Committed emissions for existing ships, from the 10 largest ship types through time, taken from the original article.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the combination of four measures: slow speed, technical and operational improvements, fuel blending and the use of zero-carbon fuel, if implemented between 2020s-2030s has the potential to reduce the baseline committed emissions by 65% to 793 MtCO2 and achieve the target of keeping within the Paris agreement carbon budgets, without the need for premature scrappage. However, any delay in appropriate implementation would result in a reduction of only 13% of committed emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that we cannot rely on measures to improve the efficiency of new ships in order to deliver what is decided in the Paris agreement and highlights the need to implement measures on existing ships, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilot study finds: Modified short-term fasting reduces chemotherapy toxicity in gynaecological cancer patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chemotherapy-induced toxicity results in patients postponing chemotherapy or in the reduction of the drugs dose used, thus compromising therapy. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that short-term fasting prior to the onset of chemotherapy has beneficial effects in tolerating chemotherapy. In study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07041-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Zorn at al. report a significant reduction of toxicity-related symptoms in patients with gynecological cancer, achieved in a controlled cross-over pilot study that used a modified short-term fasting (mSTF) protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy, a consequence of healthy cells being destroyed together with the cancer cells by the drug cocktail. Fasting is believed to protect normal cells from the detrimental effects of chemotherapy, as they enter a state of reduced cell division and stress resistance, upregulation of DNA repair and induced autophagy. In tumor cells on the other hand, growth pathways remain activated, which renders them more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case series study human patients under various fasting regimens were reported to show significantly fewer toxicity-induced symptoms, such as fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, while a randomized control trial showed that a 48-h fasting reduced bone marrow toxicity and DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, a dose-escalation fasting study demonstrated that 72h fasting during chemotherapy was safe and tolerated by the patients, while it resulted in reduced chemotherapy-related toxicity and low-grade fasting-related toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study the authors evaluated the effect of a 96-h fasting on the chemotherapy-induced toxicity in women with gynecological cancer. For the first time the effect of a 6-day intervention of Ketone diet (KD) prior to mSTF on ameliorating the negative effects of fasting was also assessed. The mSTF itself had a ketogenic composition (75% fat, 15% protein and 10% carbohydrate), as it has been shown that fasting achieves best results in a state of ketosis (elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood). The patients, who underwent a calorie restriction to 25% of their daily requirement, as a result of mSTF tolerated the fasting well and experienced much less severe symptoms of chemotherapy-induced toxicity: significantly fewer patients suffered from stomatitis, headaches and weakness and patients also showed significantly less haematological parameters of toxicity during mSTF cycles. Although previous studies had reported reduced cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after STF, in this particular study, this was not observed, possibly because the patients had already overcome these conditions due to preventive medication. Importantly, the patients on mSTM postponed much fewer chemotherapy appointments than the ones on normal diet, which reflects their better tolerance of their treatment and physical condition in general. It was also found that the KD neither reduced fasting-related discomfort nor improved compliance of the fasting regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results clearly show the potential of mSTF in counteracting chemotherapy-related toxicity and enhancing tolerance of treatment. Further larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of mSTF as a supportive approach to chemotherapy, before recommending this treatment to cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sun could come from a large, loose-knit clan or a small family that’s always fighting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New computer simulations of young stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9533&quot;&gt;suggest two pathways to forming the solar system&lt;/a&gt;. The sun could have formed in a calm, large association of 10,000 stars or more, like NGC 2244 in the present-day Rosette Nebula, an idea that’s consistent with previous research. Or the sun could be from a violent, compact cluster with about 1,000 stars, like the Pleiades, researchers report July 2 in the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether a star forms in a tight, rowdy cluster or a loose association can influence its future prospects. If a star is born surrounded by lots of massive siblings that explode as supernovas before a cluster spreads out, for example, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exploding-stars-scattered-traces-iron-over-antarctic-snow&quot;&gt;star will have more heavy elements&lt;/a&gt; to build planets with (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/9/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To nail down a stellar birthplace, astronomers have considered the solar system’s chemistry, its shape and many other factors. Most astronomers who study the sun’s birthplace think the gentle, large association scenario is most likely, says astrophysicist Fred Adams of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the new work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But most previous studies didn’t include stars’ motions over time. So astrophysicists Susanne Pfalzner and Kirsten Vincke, both of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, ran thousands of computer simulations to see how often different kinds of young stellar families produce solar systems like ours.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The main solar system feature that the pair looked for was the distance to the farthest planet from the star. Planet-forming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protoplanetary-gas-disks-stars-gaps-newborn-planets&quot;&gt;disks can extend to hundreds of astronomical units&lt;/a&gt;, or AU, the distance between the Earth and the sun (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). Theoretically, planets should be able to form all the way to the edge. But the sun’s planetary material is mostly packed within the orbit of Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have a steep drop at 30 AU, where Neptune is,” Pfalzner says. “And this is not what you expect from a disk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Pfalzner and her colleagues showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad23c&quot;&gt;a passing star could have truncated and warped&lt;/a&gt; the solar system’s outer edge long ago. If that’s what happened, it could help point to the sun’s birth environment, Pfalzner reasoned. The key was to simulate groupings dense enough that stellar flybys happen regularly, but not so dense that the encounters happen too often and destroy disks before planets can grow up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were hoping we’d get one answer,” Pfalzner says. “It turned out there are two possibilities.” And they are wildly different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large associations have more stars, but the stars are more spread out and generally leave each other alone. Those associations can stay together for up to 100 million years. Compact clusters, on the other hand, see more violent encounters between young stars and don’t last as long. The stars shove each other away within a few million years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This paper opens up another channel for what the sun’s birth environment looked like,” Adams says, referring to the violent cluster notion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study doesn’t cover every aspect of how a tight cluster could have affected the nascent solar system. The findings don’t account for how radiation from other stars in the cluster could erode planet-forming disks, for example, which could have shrunk the sun’s disk or even prevented the solar system from forming. The study also doesn’t explain certain heavy elements found in meteorites, which are thought to come from a nearby supernova and so could require the sun come from a long-lived stellar family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think [the research] is an interesting addition to the debate,” Adams says. “It remains to be seen how the pieces of the puzzle fit together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfalzner thinks that the star cluster would break apart before radiation made a big difference, and there are other explanations for the heavy elements apart from a single supernova. She hopes future studies will be able to use that sort of cosmic chemistry to narrow the sun’s birthplace down even further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For us humans, this is an important question,” Pfalzner says. “It’s part of our history.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: A giant underground motion sensor in Germany tracks Earth’s wobbles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089777</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-underground-motion-sensor-germany-earth-rotation-spin-tilt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A giant underground motion sensor in Germany has taken its first measurements of Earth’s spin and tilt. Although researchers are still getting the machine’s accuracy up to snuff, their observations could someday keep GPS navigation working reliably on devices like smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phenomena like earthquakes and ocean tides continually knock Earth’s rotation off-kilter, requiring constant correction of GPS satellite signals. Typically, corrections use telescope observations, which offer a set of celestial coordinates to determine Earth’s orientation in space. But telescope data can take days to process. The Rotational Motions in Seismology, or ROMY gyroscope array, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.033605&quot;&gt;can monitor Earth’s tiny wobbles&lt;/a&gt; continuously, researchers demonstrate in an experiment reported online July 17 in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ROMY is an upside-down pyramid of pipes, about the length of a telephone pole on each side. Its four triangular faces measure motion in different directions. On each side, one laser beam runs clockwise through the triangular piping, while another runs counterclockwise. As the triangles move with Earth’s rotation, laser beams running in the same direction as that motion have to travel farther to loop around the triangle. That stretches out the beams’ wavelength. Meanwhile, the beams going the opposite way have their wavelength compressed by their shorter path. The mismatch between wavelengths reveals the speed and tilt of Earth’s rotation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rotational Motions in Seismology lab&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089779&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071720_MT_ROMY_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089779&quot;&gt;About 20 kilometers west of Munich, the Rotational Motions in Seismology, or ROMY, is built into an underground laboratory (shown here from an aerial view). This behemoth motion sensor uses laser light coursing through a pyramid of pipes to reveal tiny deviations in the Earth’s spin and tilt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089779&quot;&gt;Fa. Wadle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a nearly seven-week test run in spring 2019, ROMY was sensitive to changes in Earth’s tilt by less than 0.00014 degrees. That seemingly tiny shift moves the Earth’s poles across the ground by about 15 meters. ROMY could also detect a change in Earth’s spin rate so small that it would add up to only a four-second difference in the length of a day, over a single rotation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s still not as accurate as telescopes, says ROMY team member Heiner Igel, a seismologist at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. To be competitive, ROMY must be at least 100 times more accurate. That will require fortifying the machine against temperature shifts that cause its piping to expand and contract, messing with measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More journals have issued expressions of concern for papers authored by the psychologist Hans Eysenck&lt;/strong&gt;. These are just the latest of many similar statements and retractions related to Eysenck’s work, particularly that which purported to find strong links between personality and cancer risk. But as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/misconduct-allegations-push-psychology-hero-his-pedestal&quot;&gt;Cathleen O’Grady reports&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, it’s taken a long time to reach this stage: some researchers began raising concerns more than 25 years ago. &lt;span id=&quot;more-39938&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public has increasingly come to accept the fact that mental health disorders have biological causes.&lt;/strong&gt; But rather than decreasing stigma towards those with mental health issues, this has actually worsened public attitudes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress&quot;&gt;argues Joseph E Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;. Davis suggests that mental health professionals should avoid explanations based on oversimplified biological terms like “chemical imbalances”, and instead “re-engage with the language of persons”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do pregnant women get cravings?&lt;/strong&gt; The reasons may be less biological and more psychological and cultural, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200715-the-surprising-reason-why-pregnant-women-get-cravings&quot;&gt;explains Veronique Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies from the United States have suggested that Americans’ loneliness has not dramatically increased during the coronavirus pandemic, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/15/890777131/video-chats-driveway-dances-and-dino-parades-buffer-pandemics-loneliness?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;writes Joanne Silberner&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers suggest that this may reflect the sense of community and solidarity that has emerged even while people have remained physically distant. However, they also point out that even before the crisis started, there were high levels of loneliness in the country, and their survey methods may have missed certain groups who are particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, loneliness isn’t the only potential negative outcome of lockdown, and many psychologists are studying how social isolation is affecting other aspects of our mental health.&lt;/strong&gt; And there is also a large body of work from pre-Covid-19 times which has examined the effects of isolation on health and cognition. At &lt;em&gt;The Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.the-scientist.com/features/how-social-isolation-affects-the-brain-67701&quot;&gt;Catherine Offord explores&lt;/a&gt; what we can learn from these studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, if you’ve been anywhere near social media this week, you’ve probably started to expect that everything you see is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tasty/status/1280966608933003264?s=20&quot;&gt;actually cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you experience a strange discomfort when you see someone cutting a slice out of what you thought were a pair of shoes, you’re not alone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mic.com/p/why-cakes-in-disguise-are-so-disturbing-according-to-psychologists-29364552&quot;&gt;According to Joseph Lamour&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Mic&lt;/em&gt;, this experience might be akin to the “uncanny valley” phenomenon, where robots or animated characters that are too &lt;span&gt;humanoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;end up looking horrific.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: An asteroid impact, not volcanism, may have made Earth unlivable for dinosaurs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089653</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impact-volcanism-earth-dinosaurs-deccan-mass-extinction</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have gone back and forth about whether massive volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact — or maybe both — caused a mass extinction that saw the demise of all nonbird dinosaurs about 66 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, geologic evidence and data on dinosaur habitats, combined with climate and ecological simulations, suggest it wasn’t the volcanism. Instead, a decades-long cold winter triggered by the giant impact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/23/2006087117&quot;&gt;wiped out dinosaur habitats and made it impossible for the creatures to survive&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report June 29 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a plot twist, volcanism at the Deccan Traps, in what is now India, may have actually ameliorated the negative effects of the long winter, warming the planet quicker than would have occurred otherwise and allowing mammals room to thrive, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a complete change in the narrative of Deccan volcanism … [which] may well have been the benevolent hero of the time,” says Alexander Farnsworth, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Bristol in England.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new research adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests the impact, not the eruptions, caused the die-off, including a recent study suggesting the bulk of volcanic outgassing happened &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-gas-bursts-probably-didnt-kill-off-the-dinosaurs&quot;&gt;either too early or too late&lt;/a&gt; to have caused the mass extinction (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/16/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated 75 percent of the planet’s plant and animal species disappeared in a relative blink of an eye during the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Previous research has indicated that a giant asteroid impact, at Chicxulub in what’s now the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, released enough ash, dust and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dino-dooming-asteroid-impact-created-chilling-sulfur-cloud&quot;&gt;gases to block out the sun and dramatically cool the planet&lt;/a&gt; for an extended period of time (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/2/17&lt;/em&gt;), possibly causing the extinction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But around the same time, Deccan Traps eruptions released massive amounts of climate-altering gases too, as well as hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers of lava, although the timing is uncertain. Such intense volcanism and associated bursts of gases have triggered other mass extinctions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying&quot;&gt;the “Great Dying&lt;/a&gt;” at the end of the Permian Period 252 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/6/18&lt;/em&gt;). As a result, the Deccan Traps still hadn’t been ruled out as the main culprit of the dinos’ die-off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Farnsworth, paleontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza of University College London and their colleagues evaluated how different dinosaur habitats would be affected under various impact and volcanism scenarios. The team ran dozens of climate and ecological simulations and compared the simulations with geologic evidence for the amount and types of gases spewed out by the eruptions, as well as with evidence of the dust kicked up into the atmosphere from crust pulverized by the asteroid impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that suitable habitat existed for the dinosaurs up until the end of the Cretaceous. After the impact, however, dust from the impact caused sunlight that reaches Earth to dim 10 to 20 percent, the simulations show, which aligns with previous research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ankylosaurus with asteroid impact in background&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089656&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070920_ms_chicxulub_inline1_680-599x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089656&quot;&gt;The asteroid impact 66 million years ago would have wiped out habitat for dinosaurs such as the ankylosaurus in this illustration. But volcanism, which has also been suggested as a cause for the mass extinction, might have actually helped ecosystems recover — though not quickly enough for dinos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089656&quot;&gt;Fabio Manucci&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With just 10 percent solar dimming, the team found that there was “almost complete blotting out of the niches for dinosaurs,” Chiarenza says, as dramatically cooling global temperatures  killed off plants. “At 15 percent, you have the blue screen of death for dinosaurs.” No volcanism scenario showed such total habitat destruction, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the impact-induced winter settled in, global temperatures reached –30° to –40° Celsius, Chiarenza says. Temperatures would not have recovered fully for at least 20 years, Farnsworth adds. If not for warming caused by carbon dioxide from the volcanic eruptions, it would have taken another 10 years for temperatures to bounce back to pre-impact averages, the simulations suggest. The volcano-induced warming, Chiarenza says, would have sped up animals’ and plants’ recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that mammals in particular had a relatively rapid recovery after the impact, including a study that shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid&quot;&gt;mammal diversity in Colorado’s Denver Basin doubled in just 100,000 years&lt;/a&gt; after the impact (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/24/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examining the habitat suitability of various dinosaurs as it relates to the extinction event is new and interesting, says Tyler Lyson, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. But accurately simulating past climate is difficult, he says. So even though much of the evidence so far points to the impact as the mass extinction culprit, uncertainty still lingers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may well be that the Deccan Traps played the role of “a creator rather than a destroyer,” Lyson says. More high-resolution datasets from around the world — such as “terrestrial datasets with plants and pollen and vertebrates from the Southern Hemisphere” — would be helpful to parse out the Deccan Traps’ influence in both extinction, if there was any, and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the storyline holds, notes Farnsworth, “unfortunately for the dinosaurs, [the volcanism] couldn’t offset enough of the cooling. But perhaps fortunately for us, it might have been enough to allow mammals to inherit and eventually dominate the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: College biology textbooks still portray a world of white scientists</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089757</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/college-biology-textbooks-representation-white-men</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin. Carolus Linneaus. Gregor Mendel. They’re all men. They’re all white. And their names appear in every biology book included in a new analysis of college textbooks. According to the survey, mentions of white men still dominate biology textbooks despite growing recognition in other media of the scientific contributions of women and people of color.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news, the researchers say: Scientists in textbooks are getting more diverse. The bad news: If diversification continues at its current pace, it will take another 500 years for mentions of Black/African American scientists to accurately reflect the number of Black college biology students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Biology is still a very white discipline, so the results were not incredibly surprising,” says Cissy Ballen, an education researcher at Auburn University in Alabama. By identifying scientist names and determining when their research was published, Ballen and her colleagues looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0877&quot;&gt;trends in seven of the most commonly used college biology textbooks&lt;/a&gt;. They published their results June 24 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that for research published between 1900 and 1999, only about 9 percent (or 55 out of 627) of scientists mentioned were women, and 3 percent (19) were people of color. But for research published between 2000 and 2018, women got 25 percent (87 out of 349) of the mentions, and people of color 8 percent (27). Some of this was representative; the number of women mentioned was proportional to the number of tenured women in the academic biology workforce over time, based on the National Science Foundation’s &lt;em&gt;Science and Engineering Indicators&lt;/em&gt;. Information about the number of tenured people of color was not available.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But the numbers were not representative of the much more diverse biology student body. Based on the change seen from the 1900s to the 2000s, Ballen and her colleagues extrapolate that it will take decades — or even centuries — for textbook mentions of scientists to reflect the gender and racial diversity of who’s in the classroom. Speficically, it will take 28 years to catch up when it comes to highlighting women scientists, 50 years for Asian scientists, 30 years for Hispanic/Latinx scientists and 500 years for Black/African American scientists. Scientists in some groups — such as Black/African American women — were never mentioned in the books at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;By the book&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auburn University education researcher Cissy Ballen and her colleagues ran an analysis by gender and race of scientists mentioned in seven major textbooks used in introductory college classes. Before 2000, 88 percent of scientists highlighted in textbooks were white men. Between 2000 and 2018 that number dropped to 67 percent, as textbook authors referenced more women and people of color.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Change in race and gender of scientists in college biology textbooks, 1900s vs. 2000s&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Change in race and gender of scientists in college biology textbooks, 1900s vs. 2000s&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089760&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071420_BB_bias-txtbk_inline-desktop_REV.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089760&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Change in race and gender of scientists in college biology textbooks, 1900s vs. 2000s&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089759&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071420_BB_bias-txtbk_inline-mobile_REV.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089759&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of who’s highlighted is only one aspect of the diversity problem, says Mark Lee, a biochemist at Spelman College in Atlanta, Ga. Textbooks are also written from a very white perspective, he notes. As an example, take a perm. Yes, the hair treatment. It comes up in biochemistry textbooks, Lee explains. “The chemistry part is just resetting disulfide bonds.” But textbooks define a perm as making straight hair curly. In fact, the same process can make naturally curly hair straight. Teaching at the all-women, 97 percent African-American Spelman, Lee says, that’s not a matter of semantics. “It’s about lived experience, and about how your lived experience is different from mine.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to increasing diverse perspectives in science,  Lee says, “I don’t think textbooks are the solution.” But they can certainly be better. “Publishers could make sure they have representation that is diverse on the writing team,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One driving factor is that most biology textbooks are presented as a history of science, Ballen says. No women from the 1600s through 1900 were mentioned in the books surveyed. “That’s 300 years of just white men in textbooks,” she says. Instead, biology textbooks could be written with more emphasis on illustrating concepts with contemporary examples, instead of historical ones. “When you look at contemporary examples, you get more diversity; both women and scientists of color have greater access to biology, they are more accessible for textbook authors and publishers to find, and more prominent in their field.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because scientist is based on historical findings, though, some history is necessary. “Textbooks have to be a blend of historical and modern,” says Peter Minorsky, a plant physiologist at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.  “If it’s all historical, then it’s not up to date. If it’s all cutting-edge, there’s no context.” Minorsky is one of the authors of &lt;em&gt;Campbell Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a textbook included in the survey, and notes that the authors are making substantial efforts to include diverse scientists. There is a note at the end of the first chapter noting how under-representation of diverse views hampers the progress of science. And each section is accompanied by an interview with a modern scientist — none of whom are white men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee certainly isn’t waiting for a more diverse textbook. Instead, he emphasizes examples from his own published science and the research being done at Spelman. “Professors have to be versed in the conventional presentation and then bring in extra content,” he says. Then, students will “see science being done by individuals like them,” instead of feeling that they are making isolated forays into the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is also crucial. “Diversity isn’t ethnicity and numbers of people; it’s about your attitude,” he says. “We can’t wait until the industry is diverse. I’m asking [professors] to take on the burden of being diverse by supporting a diverse population.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Why do so many women find it challenging to stay in postpartum HIV care?</title>

WLHIV who do not stay in care do not receive antiretroviral therapy and are at increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1511691&quot;&gt;risk of passing HIV&lt;/a&gt; to their child or partner and may also experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737584/&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; HIV-related health outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 1 in 5 HIV-exposed children in Ghana become infected with HIV by the time of cessation of breastfeeding. This rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the second-highest in West Africa and the fourth-highest among the 21 focus countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why the drop-out rates of HIV care are higher in the postpartum year than during pregnancy are not well understood. Researchers have offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111421&quot;&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt;:  women may fall out of care due to fewer scheduled encounters with the healthcare system, due to a decline in perceived susceptibility of MTCT after childbirth, due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977376/&quot;&gt;prioritization&lt;/a&gt; of their child’s health over their own, or due to challenges with childcare — but there is little evidence to support any one of these theories over the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute toward a better understanding of this issue, we conducted qualitative interviews with thirty postpartum WLHIV in Ghana, recruited in 2016 from two tertiary hospitals in the urban city of Accra. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03067-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents the barriers women themselves described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s accounts suggest that social, economic, and physical health factors, more than a change in individual motivation, may explain why fewer women remain in HIV care in the postpartum year than during pregnancy. Broadly, we found that the social and economic costs of staying in HIV care became higher in the postpartum year and many who dropped out experienced multiple barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ART-related side-effects and HIV denial were the strongest barriers during pregnancy and the fear of re-experiencing the ART-side effects continued to keep mothers away from HIV care even after childbirth. One participant shared her story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During pregnancy, I suffered when I took the drugs due to the side-effects. Thus, anytime I thought of going back for the drugs [after the birth], the thoughts of the side effects came to my mind and troubled me. I became afraid. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of travel and transport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unique barrier in the early postpartum months was difficulty traveling to HIV care due to complications from childbirth or prolonged recovery from a cesarean section. For example, one mother remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most mothers will tell you that the first six months are very tough. Many women take the time to work on themselves since some undergo an operation [i.e., C-section]. Others, too, had a vaginal tear, so they may need some time to take care of themselves. It takes six months or more for a mother to return to a normal life after childbirth [i.e., to be healthy and to visit the HIV treatment centers for care]. Some, too, are single mothers who have no support at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, for a few of the women who had dropped out of care, childbirth was associated with debt, unemployment, or underemployment. This led to a new reliance on others, such as a partner or relative, to give them money before they could make their HIV care visits, even when their motivation to stay in HIV care was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12020 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fotolia_17246913_Subscription_XL-300x174.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Mode of transportation was the most significant barrier, with increasing costs to mothers facing new sociocultural pressures unique to the postpartum year. Postpartum mothers were motivated to protect their children’s health, and often felt obligated to take a taxi to their clinical appointments instead of the cheaper local bus, called &lt;em&gt;trotro, &lt;/em&gt;which they typically took during pregnancy. Taxis could protect their children from the risk of illness and excessive heat common to the hot and crowded &lt;em&gt;trotros, &lt;/em&gt;but they were more expensive, costing one participant 70% of her monthly salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV stigma also contributed to high transportation costs, as some mothers established their HIV care far from their home to avoid being recognized. Further, those who now needed to rely on financial or childcare support to make it to appointments in their postpartum year would find it difficult to do so without disclosing their HIV status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority of pediatric care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these economic and social challenges, one would expect that mothers who had discontinued from HIV care would also be unable to adhere to their pediatric HIV testing or child well-baby visit schedules. However, we found that all the mothers who had dropped out of HIV care, except one, were engaged with the healthcare system for their child’s health. This behavior suggests that in the context of limited resources, mothers prioritized their children’s health over their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close the pregnancy-postpartum HIV-care retention gap, our results call for a package of interventions that minimize the economic burden of accessing HIV care, diminish stigma, and enhance the management of ART-related side effects. The women in our study recommended that HIV-care providers in Ghana consider extending their medication refills from three to six months. This option will not only reduce transportation costs, but it will also allow mothers to recover physically from childbirth. Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: This dinosaur may have shed its feathers like modern songbirds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089752</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microraptor-dinosaur-fossil-molting-feathers-songbirds</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A patch of three oddly short feathers spotted among the fossilized plumage of &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; may be the first evidence of a nonbird dinosaur molting. The fossil find further suggests that &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt;, which lived 120 million years ago, may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.046&quot;&gt;shed only a few feathers at a time&lt;/a&gt; — just like modern songbirds, researchers report July 15 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. Such “sequential molting,” they say, suggests that &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; was an adept and frequent flyer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aquatic birds, modern songbirds lose only a few feathers at a time, enabling them to stay aloft year-round for foraging or to escape predators. &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt;’s shorter feathers appear in just a small patch on one of the dinosaur’s four wings — suggesting that the dinosaur molted sequentially, too, bird ecologist Yosef Kiat at the University of Haifa in Israel and colleagues report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All modern, adult birds molt at least once a year to replace old, damaged feathers, or to exchange their bright summer colors for drab winter camouflage. Genetic reconstructions of bird lineages have previously suggested that sequential molting has existed in birds for at least 70 million years, and was a trait of the common ancestor of all modern birds. But this is the first fossil evidence of a nonbird dinosaur exhibiting this behavior. Furthermore, the researchers say, the find would push back the estimated origins of sequential molting by 50 million years or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of Microraptor fossil&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089754&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071620_cg_microraptor_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089754&quot;&gt;An odd gap (arrow) in the plumage on the right forelimb of this &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; fossil was created by molting, with three new feathers coming in (colored in the inset as green, yellow and orange), researchers say. The different lengths of the new feathers suggest a sequential molting strategy: the longest (red) is fully grown, while the other new feathers are at different stages of growth. The older, not-yet-replaced feathers are colored pink, purple and blue. Such sequential molting could have enabled &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; to fly year-round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089754&quot;&gt;Y. Kiat &lt;em&gt;et al/Curr Bio&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; may have been one of the earliest flyers — depending on how one defines flying. Previous analyses have suggested that the dinosaur didn’t just glide from tree to tree, but was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-birds-could-achieve-liftoff&quot;&gt;launch itself from the ground&lt;/a&gt; using its wings and back legs (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/28/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new find supports this, suggesting “that not only could &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; fly, but it could fly well, and [that] flying was an indispensable part of its lifestyle,” says vertebrate paleontologist Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study. That makes &lt;em&gt;Microraptor&lt;/em&gt; one of the most convincing cases of a nonbird dinosaur that could fly, Brusatte adds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How some superblack fish disappear into the darkness of the deep sea</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089740</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrablack-fish-pacific-blackdragon-light-absorption</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the depths of the ocean, it might take more than a little light to illuminate some of the planet’s darkest fish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some deep-sea fish have ultrablack skin capable of soaking up almost all light that hits it, making the fish nearly invisible. That camouflage is the result of a layer of densely packed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30860-5&quot;&gt;pigment-containing structures just below the skin’s surface&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online July 16 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. The skin may hide the fish from predators, or prey, and might inspire new designs for ultrablack materials used in telescopes or fabric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although little light reaches the deep sea, bioluminescent organisms can brighten the inky darkness. For creatures trying to swim undetected, living in these depths is “like trying to play hide and seek on a football field,” says Karen Osborn, a marine biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. “There’s nowhere to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;microscope image of melanosomes&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089742&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071520_eg_ultrablackfish_inline1_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089742&quot;&gt;Unlike normal black fish, ultrablack deep-sea fish have a layer of tightly packed, pigment-containing structures, called melanosomes (red arrows), in the skin. These clustered circular structures (shown in electron micrographs of the Pacific blackdragon) absorb nearly all light that hits them, including bioluminescence from other fish. The melanosomes are found beneath a membrane (blue arrows) just under the skin’s surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089742&quot;&gt;K. Osborn/Smithsonian, A.L. Davis &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Current Biology &lt;/em&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter superblack skin. Osborn and her colleagues captured 18 species of ultrablack fish from up to 2,000 meters deep in Monterey Bay off California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The team then measured how much light reflected off of the fish. The researchers also examined skin from nine species using electron microscopy and calculated how structures in the skin might absorb light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The skin has a layer of closely packed, circular, melanin-containing structures called melanosomes that can absorb up to 99.95 percent of light with wavelengths similar to ambient sunlight in the ocean or light from bioluminescent animals. The melanosomes’ size, shape and arrangement may help direct light that isn’t absorbed by an individual melanosome to others in the layer, trapping even more light. Other dark-colored fish tend to have unpigmented gaps between melanosomes, which leads to more light being reflected and a more visible fish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newfound mechanism is simpler than how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-some-birds-paradise-have-ultrablack-feathers&quot;&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; or butterflies achieve ultrablackness. Those animals’ feathers or scales have multiple layers of intricate micro- or nanostructures to absorb light (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/9/18&lt;/em&gt;). If engineers could mimic what the fish do, it may make producing ultrablack materials easier, Osborn says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Engaging With The Arts Is Related To Greater Wellbeing (But It’s Not Entirely Clear Why)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39933</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/16/engaging-with-the-arts-is-related-to-greater-wellbeing-but-its-not-entirely-clear-why/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social isolation and fears for our family and friends, as well as ourselves, have all affected psychological wellbeing during &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;the COVID-19 lockdown&lt;/a&gt;. But being unable to visit an art gallery, theatre or live music venues may also have taken its toll. According to new research by Peter Todderdell at the University of Sheffield and Giulia Poerio at the University Essex, such experiences contribute to wellbeing in a way that watching a sporting event, for example, does not. The pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-43610-001&quot;&gt;new paper,&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, presents the first longitudinal examination of the effect of engaging with the “artistic imagination” — rather than actively taking part in an artistic endeavour — on wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39933&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pair reasoned that exposure to art can affect us in various ways. We might report the “elevating” experiences of feeling awed or inspired, for example. These “eudaimonic” states can contribute to a feeling that our life has meaning, and to a sense of personal growth. Exposure to art might alternatively (or also) generate simpler feelings of pleasure — a hedonic/emotional type of wellbeing. Perhaps it may also help us to view our lives more positively, contributing to life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todderdell and Poerio explored to what extent exposure to various types of art — and the frequency of exposure — might trigger these feelings and influence these aspects of wellbeing. They classified “art” quite broadly, including everything from going to the theatre or a live concert to listening to music and watching a TV drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of three studies, the pair asked 544 participants (mostly female, and mostly students) to report on encounters with art during the previous day, and to complete questionnaires measuring various types of wellbeing (e.g. emotional wellbeing, feelings that life has meaning, and life satisfaction). As a comparison, these participants were also asked whether they had watched, listened to or attended any sports activities on the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that engaging with a variety of different arts (rather than total time spent with them) was associated with greater feelings of satisfaction and meaning in life. However, live arts and visual arts (which included drawings, paintings and photography) were associated with the highest level of elevating experiences, and with all forms of wellbeing — a link that was simply not apparent for sports spectating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delve deeper, the team ran a second study, in which 50 participants used their phones to report twice a day, for ten days (covering two weekends) on any art encounters or sports spectating, and on their current wellbeing. The results showed that unlike sports spectating, engaging with art was positively linked to all aspects of wellbeing. As before, greater “elevating feelings” during their artistic encounters seemed to be important, as higher levels of these feelings were positively associated with all aspects of wellbeing. Live arts again produced the strongest elevating experiences, and had positive associations with wellbeing, as did visual and literary arts. However, listening to music and watching movies or other screen-based dramas did not show any significant association with wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a third study, the researchers turned to data on almost 28,000 people from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk&quot;&gt;existing UK longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;. This time, they looked at levels of “art engagement” — reports of attendance at a variety of arts events, from a carnival to an art exhibition — “art participation” (dancing, photography, etc), and also participation in moderate intensity sports over a 12 month period. They then compared these with scores on a general wellbeing index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that participants who more frequently attended live art events  showed greater wellbeing three years later — even after their wellbeing levels at that first time point were taken into account. However, higher initial levels of wellbeing were also linked to greater subsequent engagement with the arts. So it seems that a certain level of wellbeing may drive us to engage with art, but that engagement then improves wellbeing still further. Interestingly, these links were much stronger for attendance than participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers took all kinds of factors, including age, gender, employment, income, into account when they performed their analysis. And they ultimately conclude that the “frequency of attendance at arts events had a positive association with subsequent mental wellbeing that was equivalent or greater than the effects of employment, marriage and education; stronger than the effect of participative arts; and equivalent to the well-established positive effect of participation in moderate intensity sport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that when we go to the theatre or a musical concert, it’s often with friends or family. This social contact could be important for explaining why these two types of arts engagement had the most consistent positive relationships with all aspects of wellbeing. However, watching a sporting event is often a social event, too, and the initial studies suggested that this doesn’t have the same effect on wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the work does suggest that engaging with art has a significant effect on wellbeing — and a more powerful effect than more active participation. But, of course, the major caveat with this work is that it is correlational. And the data can’t rule out that some other factor — &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137439963_8&quot;&gt;the personality traits of extraversion and openness, perhaps &lt;/a&gt;— drive both greater engagement in the arts, and greater wellbeing. More work is clearly needed to delve further into the role of art in our wellbeing — and the effects on us when we are deprived of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-43610-001?CheckAccess=1&quot;&gt;An investigation of the impact of encounters with artistic imagination on well-being.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Six books to help us understand eating disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144729</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/uploads/documents/2018/7/workplace.pdf&quot;&gt;70 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have an eating disorder and, with the prevalence of disordered eating on the rise,  it’s clear that this presents a significant public health issue. Despite this, many myths and misconceptions abound that are significant barriers to both treatment and public understanding of eating disorders. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, gender, or cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together a list of books that provide practical information to dispel misconceptions, as well as guidance for people affected by eating disorders and their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/if-your-adolescent-has-an-eating-disorder-9780190076825&quot;&gt;If Your Adolescent Has An Eating Disorder: An Essential Guide for Parents &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;B. Timothy Walsh and Deborah R. Glasofer &lt;img height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eating-dis-147x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;144&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an authoritative guide to understanding and helping a teenager with an eating disorder. It is designed for parents of teens who have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or who are at risk of developing one, and for other adults, such as teachers and guidance counselors, who are regularly in contact with at-risk adolescents. The book combines the latest science–including the newest treatments and most up-to-date research findings on eating disorders–with the practical wisdom of parents who have been raising teens with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-9780190926601&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders: What Everyone Needs to Know&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;B. Timothy Walsh, Evelyn Attia, and Deborah R. Glasofer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practical yet authoritative, this book defines eating disorders, explains what we know about them based on the latest science, and describes how treatment works. The book dispels common myths about eating disorders, such as the notion that they occur only amongst the affluent, that they affect only girls and women, or that they simply result from environmental factors such as the fashion industry and society’s obsession with thinness. This book is essential reading for those seeking authoritative and current information about these often-misunderstood illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-void-inside-9780190061166&quot;&gt;The Void Inside: Bringing Purging Disorder to Light&lt;/a&gt; by Pamela K. Keel&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/void-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book chronicles the growing recognition of purging disorder at the turn of the millennium, reviews what science has taught us about the illness, and explains the medical complications that purging may bring. The author, known for her work identifying and naming purging disorder, presents irrefutable evidence that it can no longer be considered a subset of better-known eating disorders. Keel illuminates how the illness impacts the lives of real people to underscore the severity of this hidden eating disorder and the need for greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exposure-therapy-for-eating-disorders-9780190069742&quot;&gt;Exposure Therapy for Eating Disorders  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Carolyn Black Becker, Nicholas R. Farrell, and Glenn Waller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is designed to augment existing eating disorder treatment manuals by providing clinicians with practical advice for maximizing the effectiveness of exposure, regardless of clinical background or evidence-based treatment used. Suitable for use with a range of diagnoses, this easy-to-use guide describes the most up to date empirical research on exposure for eating disorders. The book also provides strategies for overcoming obstacles, including institutional resistance to implementation of exposure therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/handbook-of-positive-body-image-and-embodiment-9780190841874&quot;&gt;Handbook of Positive Body Image and Embodiment  &lt;/a&gt;by Tracy L. Tylka and Niva Piran&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EXrVViuTSC0-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is the first comprehensive, research-based resource to address the breadth of innovative theoretical concepts and related practices concerning positive ways of living in the body. Presenting chapters by world-renowned experts in body image and eating behaviors, the handbook explores how therapeutic interventions and public health and policy initiatives can inform scholarly, clinical, and prevention-based work in the field of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-the-facts-9780198715603&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders: The Facts &lt;/a&gt;by Suzanne Abraham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sympathetically and clearly written, this guide considers why eating disorders occur, and then looks at each in turn, describing the eating behaviours, diagnosis, and treatments available. Case histories and patient perspectives provide insights into the mind of the eating disorder sufferer, making it easier for patients and their families to relate to the topics discussed. The book&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides an authoritative resource on eating disorders that will prove valuable for sufferers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These titles highlight some of the most pressing issues in the field of eating disorder research. Greater awareness among stakeholders – including healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers, and the general public – can address ongoing challenges and inform future directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/vintage-book-light-bulb-wood-table_1007385.htm&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by jannoon028 via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/six-books-to-help-us-understand-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;Six books to help us understand eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/630516433/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2feating-dis-147x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-to-experience-pandemic-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we experience pandemic time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/testing-einsteins-theory-of-relativity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Testing Einstein’s theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/accept-death-to-promote-health/#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Accept death to promote health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: The closest images of the sun ever taken reveal ‘campfire’ flares</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089732</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-orbiter-closest-images-sun-nasa-esa</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Get out the marshmallows and toasting sticks. The closest images yet taken of the sun show tiny flares dubbed “campfires,” astronomers announced in a news conference on July 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter/Solar_Orbiter_s_first_images_reveal_campfires_on_the_Sun&quot;&gt;images are the first from Solar Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;, a new sun-watching spacecraft that’s a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By looking from close by, we get so much sharper images,” said David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels in the news conference. The pictures were better than the science team expected. “When the first images came in, the first thought was, ‘This is not possible! It cannot be that good.’”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These never-before-seen campfire flares are thought to be little relatives of larger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-flares-paradox&quot;&gt;solar flares&lt;/a&gt;, powerful magnetic outbursts that shoot bright spurts of radiation into space (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/11/17&lt;/em&gt;). Campfire flares are a million to a billion times as small as typical solar flares. The smallest ones in the Solar Orbiter images are a few hundred kilometers across, “about the size of a European country,” Berghmans said. It’s not clear yet whether the flickers are just scaled-down solar flares, or if the two phenomena have different driving mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Solar physicists think campfires could help explain one of the biggest solar mysteries: why the solar corona, the sun’s wispy outer atmosphere, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona&quot;&gt;millions of degrees hotter than the solar surface&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/20/17&lt;/em&gt;). Together, the small but ubiquitous flares could be a source of energy to the corona that astronomers haven’t accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These campfires are totally insignificant each by themselves, but summing up their effect all over the sun, they might be the dominant contribution to the heating of the solar corona,” said Frédéric Auchère of the Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;examples of 'campfire' flares on the sun&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089734&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071520_lg_SolarOrbiter_inline1-674x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089734&quot;&gt;Solar Orbiter captured these pictures of “campfire” flares (indicated with arrows) on the sun in extreme ultraviolet wavelengths of light.

&lt;p&gt;Solar Orbiter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones&quot;&gt;launched February 9&lt;/a&gt; with a suite of scientific instruments to observe the sun and its surroundings (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/9/20&lt;/em&gt;). The new images were taken May 30 with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager camera when the spacecraft was 77 million kilometers from the sun, about half the distance from Earth. Berghmans and Auchère are the principal investigators for the orbiter’s ultraviolet camera.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other spacecraft have swooped closer to the sun. The Parker Solar Probe has gotten as close as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-reveals-sun-plasma-waves-magnetic-islands&quot;&gt;24 million kilometers&lt;/a&gt;, collecting data but no direct photos because it gets too close (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/4/19&lt;/em&gt;). It will eventually reach 6 million kilometers from the sun’s surface. Ultimately, Solar Orbiter will come within about 42 million kilometers of the sun, and will be the first spacecraft to fly over the sun’s poles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: A balancing act: gender and welfare regimes in the association between work-life conflict and poor health</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/work-life-balance-5333802_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us find it increasingly difficult to separate our work from our personal lives. Modern technologies exacerbate the problem, with our inability to ‘switch off’ and tendency to take calls and check emails outside of working hours. What’s more, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for those of us working from home, where the line between our jobs and family lives has become even more blurred, and for those working longer shifts in hospitals, supermarkets or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already known that work-life imbalances can negatively affect both our physical and mental health. However, we know little about the factors that strengthen or weaken this association. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09139-w/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;New research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at the influence of gender and level of welfare provision by the state on the link between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Mensah and Adjei analyze data from over 32,000 workers, aged 16 to 64, from 30 European countries. This data was collected as part of the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; European Working Conditions Survey, carried out in 2015 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors perform statistical analysis on the association between work-life balance and self-reported health, which previous studies have found to be a reliable proxy of overall health, and factor in other variables such as gender and welfare regime. Validating earlier studies, the results show that there is a significant association between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender differences in the association between work-life conflict and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional gender roles permeate our everyday levels such that, in many cultures, women more often take on a caring role within the family unit and men are seen as the so-called ‘breadwinner’. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/12951&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;This is changing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the last 40 years seeing increased participation of women in the labor market and a rise in the number of dual-earning families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, does gender affect the association between work-life conflict and self-reported health? Mensah and Adjei find that while men more often report a poor work-life balance across different European countries, there is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of reasons for this. Women still bear the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;greater burden of childcare responsibilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, creating additional pressures at home as well as in the workplace. Women also face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/workplace-gender-discrimination-remains-rife-survey-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased discrimination at work and lower rates of pay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which may contribute to the impact of work-life conflict on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of the welfare state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12015 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/postit-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;The strength of this study’s large cross-European sample is that it enables comparison between groups of countries with different welfare regimes, with countries classified as Nordic (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway), Conservative (such as Germany and Switzerland), Liberal (UK and Ireland), Southern Europe (such as Greece, Spain and Italy) and Central and Eastern Europe (including Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Croatia and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mensah and Adjei report that work-life balance is best for both working men and women in the Nordic countries. There is also a weaker association between poor work-life balance and poor self-reported health in these countries, which the authors attribute to their substantial welfare provision including availability of childcare, universal healthcare and long parental leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association between work-life conflict and poor health is strongest in countries with Liberal and Conservative welfare regimes, with Conservative states also being the only ones where the association is stronger in men than in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors may be at play here, including increased emphasis on the male breadwinner role, weaker employment regulation and unions, and more stringent social welfare than the Nordic states. However, it remains to be established why Southern European states, with the least generous welfare policies, fared better. Further work is also needed to determine the specific contribution of individual policies on work-life conflict and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking a healthy balance in future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, the findings of this study may help us to reflect on how often we allow commitments at work encroach on our personal lives and negatively impact our health. So how might we guard against the stresses and strains of work-life conflict in future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity, recommends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/w/work-life-balance&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a number of measures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; including better prioritization of tasks at work, taking proper breaks in the working day, dedicating time for exercise or hobbies, and keeping a record of time spent working or thinking about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points to systemic differences to be addressed by governments and policymakers. As we strive towards equality, the differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, countries vary widely in political and economic landscape and so too does the level of social and financial intervention by the state, but strategies to help minimize work-life conflict would surely pay dividends in fostering a healthier population and workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Climate change made Siberia’s heat wave at least 600 times more likely</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089720</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-siberia-heat-wave-more-likely-global-warming-arctic</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The intense heat wave that gripped Siberia during the first half of 2020 would have been impossible without human-caused climate change, a new study finds. Researchers with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/&quot;&gt;World Weather Attribution Network&lt;/a&gt; report that climate change made the prolonged heat in the region at least 600 times more likely — and possibly as much as 99,000 times more likely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t expect the natural world to generate [such a heat wave] in anything less than 800,000 years or so,” climate scientist Andrew Ciavarella of the U.K. Met Office in Exeter, England, said July 14 in a news conference. It’s “effectively impossible without human influence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study, posted online July 15, examined two aspects of the heat wave: the persistence and intensity of average temperatures across Siberia from January to June 2020; and daily maximum temperatures during June 2020 in the remote Siberian town of Verkhoyansk.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Tiny Verkhoyansk made international headlines when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/siberia-verkhoyansk-record-heat-wave-arctic-circle&quot;&gt;logged a record high temperature of 38° C&lt;/a&gt;elsius (100.4° Fahrenheit) on June 20 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/23/20&lt;/em&gt;). The record was just one extreme amid a larger and longer event in the region that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context&quot;&gt;led to a series of human and natural disasters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). Those include wildfires across Siberia, the collapse of a fuel tank in the mining city of Norilsk due to sagging permafrost, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future&quot;&gt;heat health effects&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/3/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using observational data from Verkhoyansk and other Siberian weather stations, the researchers first assessed the rarity of the observed temperatures and determined temperature trends. Then they compared these observations with hundreds of climate simulations using different greenhouse gas warming scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hot spot&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data collected by NASA’s Aqua satellite show that temperatures on land in Siberia from March 19 through June 20, 2020, were much higher than the average March–June temperatures from 2003 to 2018. Deep red values indicate regions more than 8 degrees Celsius higher than average; blue values are colder than average. The town of Verkhoyansk (dot) logged a record high temperature of 38° C (100.4° Fahrenheit) on June 20.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Temperatures in Siberia, March 19–June 2020 compared with spring averages 2003–2018&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Temperatures in Siberia, March 19–June 2020 compared with spring averages 2003–2018&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089722&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071520_cg_arcticwarming_inline1_desktop.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089722&quot;&gt;NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Temperatures in Siberia, March 19–June 2020 compared with spring averages 2003–2018&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089723&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071520_cg_arcticwarming_inline1_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089723&quot;&gt;NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Had such a hot spell occurred in 1900 instead of 2020, it would have been at least 2 degrees cooler on average, the researchers found. In Verkhoyansk, climate change amped up June temperatures by at least 1 degree relative to 1900. And such heat waves are likely to become more common in the near future, the scientists found: By 2050, temperatures in Siberia could increase by between 2.5 degrees to as much as 7 degrees compared to the year 1900, the report finds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper &quot;Towards a new approach to reveal dynamical organization of the brain using topological data analysis&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how our brains dynamically adapt for efficient functioning. Most
previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of
brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by
collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s
dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall
organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an
interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using
existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of
transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and
between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4–9 s) than before. The
individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task
performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into
interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Amir Khan will talk about the paper &quot;Spiking Neural Networks Evolved to Perform Multiplicative Operations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplicative or divisive changes in tuning curves of individual neurons to one stimulus (&quot;input&quot;) as another stimulus (&quot;modulation&quot;) is applied, called gain modulation, play an important role in perception and decision making. Since the presence of modulatory synaptic stimulation results in a multiplicative operation by proportionally changing the neuronal input-output relationship, such a change affects the sensitivity of the neuron but not its selectivity. Multiplicative gain modulation has commonly been studied at the level of single neurons. Much less is known about arithmetic operations at the network level. In this work we have evolved small networks of spiking neurons in which the output neurons respond to input with non-linear tuning curves that exhibit gain modulation—the best network showed an over 3-fold multiplicative response to modulation. Interestingly, we have also obtained a network with only 2 interneurons showing an over 2-fold response.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;On movie missions to Mars, getting there is the easy part. &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Watney was fine until a dust storm left him fending for himself. Douglas Quaid’s jaunt to the Red Planet in &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt; was smooth sailing until he came under fire at Martian customs and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in real life, just getting to Mars and back will be rife with dangers that have nothing to do with extreme weather or armed gunmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The mission to Mars is likely going to be four to six individuals [living] together in a can the size of a Winnebago for three years,” says Leticia Vega, associate chief scientist for the NASA Human Research Program in Houston. Time on the planet will be sandwiched between a six- to nine-month journey there plus the same long trip back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once outside of Earth’s protective gravitational and magnetic fields, microgravity and radiation become big worries. Microgravity allows fluid buildup in the head, which can cause vision problems, and adventurers cruising through interplanetary space will be continually pelted with high-energy charged particles that zip right through the metal belly of a spacecraft. Researchers don’t know just how harmful that radiation is, but lab experiments suggest it could raise astronauts’ risk of cancer and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The length of the mission brings its own dangers. “The moon was like a camping trip when you think about going to Mars,” says Erik Antonsen, an emergency medicine physician and aerospace engineer at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Setting aside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigors-mars-trip-make-teamwork-priority&quot;&gt;social and psychological problems&lt;/a&gt; that could arise among people trapped together inside an interplanetary mobile home (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/29/14, p. 22&lt;/em&gt;), three years offers a lot more time and opportunity to get sick or injured than a dayslong Apollo mission. And Mars is about 600 times farther from Earth than the moon is. Even light-speed communications will take about 20 minutes to reach Earth from Mars. Phoning Houston for help in an emergency is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is, when we do the first missions to Mars, there’s a high likelihood that somebody may die,” Antonsen says. “If someone goes out and they get an abrasion on their eyeball and it’s not responding to whatever [is] on the vehicle, they’re coming back one-eyed Jack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite those dangers, the United States, Russia, China and other nations have all voiced their intentions to send people to the Red Planet. NASA is gunning for a mission to Mars in the 2030s. With that deadline in mind, researchers are developing a suite of medical devices and medications to bring on a trip to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The items on this packing list are in the very early stages of development, and in some cases, still pretty impractical and unproven. Universal diagnostic wands are a distant dream. But researchers are devising artificial-gravity suits, anti-radiation medications and miniature medical tools that scientists hope will be ready in about a decade to keep the first travelers to Mars safe and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Faking gravity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For something that looks so relaxing, floating in microgravity is surprisingly bad for you. When the body doesn’t have to pull its own weight, muscles and bones weaken. This was a big problem in the early days of spaceflight. When the Soviet Soyuz 9 crew &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/soyuz-returns&quot;&gt;returned from a record 18 days in space&lt;/a&gt; in June 1970, one cosmonaut was so weak that he couldn’t carry his own helmet when he stepped out of the landing capsule (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/70, p. 615&lt;/em&gt;). Today, astronauts on the International Space Station keep up their strength by exercising for a couple of hours each day. But other problems with life in microgravity remain unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In space, bodily fluids that Earth’s gravity normally keeps in the lower body drift toward the head, increasing intracranial pressure. “If you were to sit down in a chair and put your head between your knees … that’s a bit what it feels like,” says NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn, who completed a five-month stint on the space station in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Koichi Wakata on the ISS&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089522&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-3-680_wide.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089522&quot;&gt;While in space, astronauts like Koichi Wakata of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency exercise about two hours every day to keep their muscles and bones from severely weakening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089522&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that constant elevated pressure behind the eyes is to blame for vision problems, such as farsightedness, that about half of astronauts develop in space. “I had a harder time reading the keys on the laptop,” Marshburn recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weightlessness also confuses the gravity-­sensing vestibular organs in the inner ear that play a role in balance and motor control. Upon returning to Earth, “I could walk in a straight line pretty easily by the end of that day, but it took me a few days before I could start to walk around a corner” without running into the wall, Marshburn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sure astronauts can walk straight and see what they’re doing on Mars, a spaceship could be outfitted with artificial-gravity machines. One such machine is a lower body negative pressure, or LBNP, chamber. The device applies vacuum pressure to the lower half of the body while a person is sealed in from the waist down. The vacuum re-creates the downward pull of gravity, planting the person’s feet firmly on the floor of the chamber and drawing bodily fluids toward the legs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;LBNP suits&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089520&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-1-1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089520&quot;&gt;Lower body negative pressure, or LBNP, suits mimic the effects of gravity by using vacuum pressure to pull a person’s body toward the bottoms of the feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089520&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, 10 volunteers who already had medical devices implanted to measure intracranial pressure sealed their lower bodies inside an LBNP chamber. Participants had to lie down for the experiment to bring their intracranial pressure closer to what it would be like in space. When someone on Earth goes from standing to lying down, their intracranial pressure rises from around 0 millimeters of mercury to about 15 mmHg — closer to what astronauts are thought to experience in space. As the researchers slowly increased the device’s vacuum pressure, participants’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP276557&quot;&gt;average intracranial pressure dropped from 15 to 9.4 mmHg&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers reported in 2019 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We really don’t know right now how much time [in LBNP] we need to protect the body” from the harmful effects of fluid shifts in space, says Alan Hargens, a space physiologist at the University of California, San Diego. But in case LBNP becomes a significant part of the day, Hargens’ team built a prototype LBNP suit that can be worn during daily activity. The suit consists of a pair of overalls with built-in shoes and a seal around the waist. Vacuum pressure pulls the wearer down onto the shoe soles. “These lower body negative pressure devices are an early form of artificial gravity,” Hargens says. Such devices may be easier to send into space than alternatives being tested, such as centrifuges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A centrifuge simulates gravity through centri­fugal force — the effect that keeps water in the bottom of a bucket when you swing it over your head. A centrifuge designed to help astronauts in microgravity looks sort of like a carousel, but with beds instead of ponies. The rider lies on a bed, head pointing toward the center of the carousel, which spins to exert a horizontal centri­fugal force out toward the feet that’s as strong as the downward pull of gravity. A room-sized centrifuge would be a lot harder to launch in a spaceship than an LBNP suit. But some researchers think the whole-body-centrifuge experience may combat microgravity issues that LBNP doesn’t, such as the inner ear problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effects of a centrifuge on sensorimotor control, Rachael Seidler, a motor control researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and colleagues kept 24 volunteers in bed for 60 days to mimic life in microgravity. Sixteen of the participants spun in a centrifuge for a total of 30 minutes each day, while the other eight got no centrifugation. Before and after bed rest, participants were tested on their balance and were put through an obstacle course. “We’ve just had a very preliminary peek” at the data, Seidler says, but “it does look like the artificial gravity was helpful” for motor control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Human centrifugre&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089521&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-2-1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089521&quot;&gt;Centrifuges re-create the footward force of gravity by spinning people around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089521&quot;&gt;German Space Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Bracing for radiation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Life in microgravity may be a problem for a Mars crew, but at least it’s a familiar challenge to astronauts. Chronic exposure to deep space radiation, on the other hand, is a hazard that no space traveler has faced before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solar system is awash in charged particles called galactic cosmic rays that travel at nearly the speed of light. These particles tear through metal like it’s tissue paper and can kill cells or create mutations in the DNA within. Astronauts on the space station, like folks on Earth, are largely protected from these tiny wrecking balls by Earth’s magnetic field. But a Mars-bound crew will be totally exposed. En route to the Red Planet, astronauts are expected to receive almost two millisieverts of radiation daily — roughly equal to getting a full-body CT scan every six days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only people ever fully immersed in deep space radiation were those who went to the moon, but they were exposed for less than two weeks. On a Mars mission, “we really don’t know exactly what’s going to happen to humans when they get these types of exposures,” says Emmanuel Urquieta, a space medicine researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But judging by lab animal and cell experiments, this radiation won’t be giving astronauts any superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In tests on animals and in human tissue, beams of particles designed to mimic space radiation degrade heart and blood vessel tissue, suggesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrcardio.2017.157#citeas&quot;&gt;a Mars crew may be at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2018 report in&lt;em&gt; Nature Reviews Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, observations of rodents exposed to radiation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214552419300033#!&quot;&gt;suggest that space radiation impairs cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in a review article in the May 2019&lt;em&gt; Life Sciences in Space Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s also a good amount of data on radiation’s ability to induce cancer” in the lungs, liver and brain, says Peter Guida, a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., who studies the biological effects of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scary radiation effects seen in lab animals or cell cultures should be taken with a grain of salt. A mouse is not a person, and brain cells in a dish do not make a brain. Also, animals and cells typically get the entire Mars mission–level dose of radiation in a single session or in a series of radiation exposures over weeks or months, which is not the same thing as getting constant, low-level exposure. But the warning signs from these experiments are worrying enough that researchers are testing various anti-radiation medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest and most promising field for counter­measure development is antioxidants,” Guida says. High-energy charged particles can cause damage by splintering water molecules in the body into toxic compounds called reactive oxygen species. Priming the body with anti­oxidants could help neutralize some of those reactive oxygen species and curb their effects. Options include vitamins A and E, as well as selenomethionine, an ingredient found in some dietary supplements. “All these have shown at various levels to decrease the negative effects of radiation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Medical problems astronauts are at relatively high risk of developing while in space:&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rashes/skin irritations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motion sickness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood clots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasal congestion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farsightedness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Astronaut icon&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089524&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-4-500-opt-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089524&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even harnessing the natural antioxidant powers of berries might help. In one experiment, rats fed food laced with freeze-dried blueberry powder for four weeks seemed to perform slightly better on a memory test after exposure to high-energy charged particles than rats fed normal chow before exposure. In the test, the rats were shown two objects: one they had seen before radiation exposure and one they had not. Blueberry-fed rats spent almost 70 percent of their time exploring the new object, as expected of animals that recognized the old object. But the other rats spent about half their time exploring each object, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214552416300864&quot;&gt;suggesting that they’d forgotten the object they’d seen before&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in 2017 in &lt;em&gt;Life Sciences in Space Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants, on their own, may not be enough protection, says Marjan Boerma, a radiation biologist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock. Boerma and colleagues are testing whether aspirin and other anti-inflammatories, including a form of vitamin E called gamma-tocotrienol, can help reduce cell damage from high-energy particles. It may take a medley of pharmaceuticals — or perhaps a carefully blended smoothie. Scientists are still far from hammering out the exact ingredients of that anti-radiation regimen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Astronaut, heal thyself&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pulling shifts in artificial gravity and swallowing antioxidants may become part of an astronaut’s daily routine. But Mars visitors will also have to deal with any unexpected illnesses and injuries without mission control to talk them through an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Mars crew may include a physician. “But that person could also get sick,” Urquieta says, “and that physician is not going to be board-­certified in 10 different specialties.” Ideally, the Mars spaceship would be equipped with artificial intelligence that could consider an astronaut’s symptoms, recommend medical tests, make diagnoses and assign treatments. But a reliable “Dr. AI” is nowhere close to reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measuring up&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 30 nonphysicians learned first aid from a software system designed to help astronauts. Months after training, the novices did pretty well, except for inserting a breathing tube and an IV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;First aid procedure success rate after training&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089529&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-6-680_desktop.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;First aid procedure success rate after training&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089530&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-6-680_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: D. Ebert &lt;/em&gt;et al&lt;em&gt;/NASA Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, the most sophisticated symptom checkers are tools like VisualDx, diagnostic software used by health care workers in hospitals and clinics. The user answers questions about a patient, such as symptoms and demographic features, to winnow down possible diagnoses. For skin conditions, VisualDx can also analyze photos of a patient’s skin; it’s now being expanded to help users assess ultrasound scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Art Papier, a dermatologist and chief executive officer at VisualDx, and colleagues designed a version of the system for use in deep space that works on a laptop without internet. The software doesn’t have to account for every possible diagnosis, like infectious diseases from the tropics. Instead, the focus is on medical conditions that astronauts have a fairly high chance of developing, like rashes or kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help walk astronauts through first aid and medical exams, spaceflight physiologist and space medicine scientist Douglas Ebert of KBR, Inc. in Houston and colleagues are developing a tool called the Autonomous Medical Officer Support, or AMOS, system. An early version of the software uses pictures and videos to teach novices how to perform an eye exam, for example, or insert a breathing tube.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested an AMOS prototype with about 30 nonphysicians, who learned how to perform several medical procedures. Those people came back three to nine months later to do the procedures again, using the software for guidance as necessary, to mimic how an astronaut would use AMOS for preflight training and in-the-moment support during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around 80 percent of participants accurately performed eye exams and ultrasounds and about 70 percent correctly inserted an IV. When it came to a tougher task — inserting a breathing tube — just about half pulled it off, Ebert and colleagues reported in January in Galveston, Texas, at the NASA Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop. In April, astronauts on board the space station successfully used the software to perform kidney and bladder ultrasound scans without help from ground control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When performing medical exams, astronauts won’t have the starship &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;’s sick bay at their disposal. They’ll need miniature medical devices that fit on the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For medical imaging, space medicine researchers have their eyes on a new ultrasound device called the Butterfly iQ that replaces the variety of transducers usually needed to image different body parts with a single probe the size of an electric razor. Standard ultrasound machinery is around 15 times heavier than the Butterfly iQ, which displays images on a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Butterfly iQ&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-4-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089527&quot;&gt;A new portable ultrasound machine, the Butterfly iQ, uses a single probe (left) containing a silicon chip that buzzes to generate ultrasonic waves at a variety of frequencies to do whole-body scans. About the size of an electric razor, the probe displays images on a smartphone (right) and is smaller and easier to use than ultrasound machines on the International Space Station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089527&quot;&gt;Butterfly Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company 1Drop Diagnostics, which is developing credit card–sized chips to detect chemical markers of different diseases in blood samples from a finger prick, is working on portable blood tests for astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical kit that astronauts use to patch each other up will have to be lightweight and compact. To decide what goes in a spaceship first aid kit, researchers use NASA’s Integrated Medical Model, which forecasts which health problems the astronauts on a particular mission are most likely to have.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers plug in mission details, like where the crew is headed and astronauts’ genders and preexisting conditions. The model then runs thousands of mission simulations to gauge the risks of that specific crew having anything from constipation to a heart attack so that planners can prioritize medical kit supplies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;1Drop Diagnostics chip&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089528&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_MT_spacehealth_inline-5-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089528&quot;&gt;1Drop Diagnostics is developing a credit card–sized chip to detect markers of disease in a blood drop. An array of detectors on the chip contains chemicals that emit fluorescent light when they latch onto a specific biomarker. The higher a biomarker’s concentration in the blood, the brighter the glow, which is translated by a reader. 1Drop chips can detect biomarkers of heart failure and blood clots in the lungs, plus liver and kidney problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089528&quot;&gt;1Drop Diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ebert and colleagues have already used this system to build a preliminary first aid packing list for a crewed lunar flyby mission that NASA has planned for 2022. For this three-week trip, the first aid kit is pretty simple: medication for back pain, motion sickness and the like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Packing for Mars is going to be a whole new ball game, Ebert says. But researchers still have at least a decade to shrink their equipment down to size and figure out what mix of medical supplies will give Mars astronauts the best chance of surviving their epic voyage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: The new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines are here</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/15/the-new-arrive-2-0-guidelines-are-here/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ARRIVE-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals&quot;&gt;BMC Series&lt;/a&gt; journals, it is important that the research we consider and publish can be utilised and is trusted.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of animals has been considered and that the harm involved is justified by the expected benefit of the research. To support us, we utilise tools such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;Animal research: reporting &lt;em&gt;In Vivo &lt;/em&gt;Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the integrity and soundness of submissions that report on animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/&quot;&gt;NC3Rs&lt;/a&gt; developed the ARRIVE guidelines; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NC3Rs-ARRIVE-Guidelines-Checklist-fillable.pdf&quot;&gt;20 point checklist&lt;/a&gt; covering measures associated with bias (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, data handling) with the aim to improving the quality of both scientific research design and reporting of animal studies. The guidelines prompt authors to provide sufficient detail in their research paper that would allow the reader to assess the methodological rigour of the experiment, determine the reliability of the findings, and to reproduce and build upon the work. Unfortunately, the argument for the success of ARRIVE has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197882&quot;&gt;varied&lt;/a&gt; since its launch, and despite being widely endorsed by journals, funding bodies and research institutions, the quality of reporting in animal research publications is still far from roubust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems encountered using the ARRIVE 2010 guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Editor, I have noticed that authors use the ARRIVE checklist in different ways. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001756&quot;&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; adoption of ARRIVE by journals, many authors, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-10&quot;&gt;editors&lt;/a&gt;, are still not aware of these guidelines, or see them as an unnecessary box ticking exercise. This lack of awareness can also affect how authors plan their research where issues related to bias may not have been appropriately considered, and this has a knock-on-effect at the manuscript writing stage. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we often receive ARRIVE checklists that are incomplete or don’t correspond to what is reported in the paper. These issues could be related to language barriers or differences in research culture where authors are still not fully aware of the consequences of incomplete reporting. Alternatively, it may be related to the misconception that admitting to non-compliance of an ARRIVE item will disqualify a manuscript from being published. Overall, comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task for editors and reviewers when evaluating the robustness of the methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in an attempt to improve uptake, an international working group was formed to review the original ARRIVE 2010 guidelines and develop a strategy that would make ARRIVE easier for researchers, editors and reviewers to use. We are pleased to announce that the new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines have been published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt; and re-published by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02451-y&quot;&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE 2.0 – what has changed?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall guidelines have been simplified. Items from the original checklist have been updated and reorganised and are now presented in two categories: the ‘&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE Essential 10&lt;/strong&gt;’ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Set&lt;/strong&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘ARRIVE Essential 10’ is a list of key items that authors should address in their manuscript text as a minimum standard and represents best practice. If adhered to, reporting of these items should have the biggest impact on improving the quality and reliability of animal research studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second list of recommendations is designed to provide greater context and background to the study. This includes items such as conflicts of interest, protocol registration, and animal housing and welfare aspects. While not strictly essential, these points will add value to the review process, enhancing the transparency of the study design and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000411&quot;&gt;Explanation and Elaboration&lt;/a&gt; (E&amp;amp;E) document has also be made available. This helps to describe each of the ARRIVE 2.0 items in greater context and detail, and includes best practice examples from the published literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARRIVE 2.0 update joins a host of other ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021&quot;&gt;initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address factors contributing to poor reproducibility.  There is still much work to be done to engage key stakeholders to create a process whereby these standards can be consistently implemented and enforced at the research planning stage, and then hopefully mandated by all journals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Despite a new measurement, the debate over the universe’s expansion rages on</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089710</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-measurement-debate-universe-expansion-rate-big-bang</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the expansion rate of the universe, physicists have apparently agreed to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two types of measurements clash over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis&quot;&gt;how fast the cosmos is expanding&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/19&lt;/em&gt;). Now, a new estimate from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, or ACT, further entrenches this disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To tease out the properties of the universe, ACT observes light emitted shortly after the Big Bang, known as the cosmic microwave background. Those observations reveal that the universe is expanding a rate of about &lt;a href=&quot;https://phy-act1.princeton.edu/public/saiola/act_dr4_A20.pdf&quot;&gt;67.9 kilometers per second&lt;/a&gt; for each megaparsec (about 3 million light-years), physicists report in &lt;a href=&quot;https://phy-act1.princeton.edu/public/saiola/act_dr4_C20.pdf&quot;&gt;two papers&lt;/a&gt; posted online and submitted to arXiv.org. The number aligns with that of an earlier cosmic microwave background experiment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks&quot;&gt;Planck&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/24/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As an independent experiment, we see the same thing,” says cosmologist Simone Aiola of the Flatiron Institute in New York City. Located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, ACT observes the cosmic microwave background with a higher resolution than Planck did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cosmic microwave background&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089711&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071420_EC_expanding_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3089711&quot;&gt;To measure the expansion of the universe, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope mapped out the cosmic microwave background (one portion shown). Colors represent differences in the polarization, the orientation of the light’s electromagnetic waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089711&quot;&gt;ACT Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both ACT and Planck disagree with most estimates from objects that emitted their light more recently, such as exploding stars called supernovas and bright hearts of galaxies known as quasars. Those studies tend to indicate a faster expansion rate of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If no simple explanation can be found for the discrepancy, it could dramatically alter physicists’ understanding of the contents of the universe and how the cosmos changes over time. For example, dark energy, the shadowy stuff that causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, might behave differently than scientists thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers had speculated that an unidentified source of experimental error in the Planck data could have accounted for the mismatch. But with the independent measurement from ACT, that explanation has gone out the window. That frees physicists to focus on other explanations, like potential issues with the supernova or quasar measurements, or the possibility of unexplained new physics phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, says cosmologist Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, “we can proceed without the niggling worries.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Two new books explore Mars — and what it means to be human</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089475</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-books-human-exploration</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Science writer Kate Greene couldn’t have known that her memoir about her time on a make-believe Mars mission would be published as millions of people on Earth isolated themselves in their homes for months amid a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iJG9me&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of the book cover of Once Upon A Time I Lived on Mars &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089531&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_reviews_cover-once-254x383.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iJG9me&quot;&gt;Once Upon a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iJG9me&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iJG9me&quot;&gt;I Lived on Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Greene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;St. Martin’s Press, $27.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But her book is one of two about Mars published this month that are oddly well-suited to the present moment. &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time I Lived on Mars&lt;/em&gt; and Sarah Stewart Johnson’s &lt;em&gt;The Sirens of Mars&lt;/em&gt; are both about exploration. Yet they’re also about many different types of isolation and the human yearning to not be alone.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Greene participated in a mock Mars mission, called HI-SEAS, for Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, in 2013. She and five others lived in a dome on a rocky, barren patch atop Mauna Loa volcano for four months with no fresh food, no fresh air (all excursions were conducted in clunky “spacesuits”) and no instantaneous contact with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA and other space agencies run such missions to figure out best practices for keeping astronauts sane and productive in isolated and stressful environments. It’s well-documented that boredom can lead to mistakes or inattention. Other simulated Mars missions suggest that astronauts isolated together could develop an us-versus-them mentality that would lead the crew to stop listening to mission control, which could be dangerous on a long mission.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;With humor and sensitivity, Greene relates how her crew got along (or didn’t), what she read, what she ate and the time-delayed e-mails she exchanged with loved ones back on “Earth.” Through the book’s series of essays, she uses the mission as a lens to examine everything from the ethics and economics of space travel to the nature of time, love and home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her descriptions of boredom and seclusion feel especially apt in a time of social distancing: “the way certain aspects of your environment, daily schedule and conversations smooth over, lose their texture.” Greene relates her experience to astronaut Michael Collins’ time orbiting in the Apollo 11 capsule alone while his crewmates walked on the moon. She connects both of those experiences to that of her brother, who spent the last year and a half of his life confined to a hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On this oasis of a planet,” she writes, “there are so many ways to feel isolated, each of us with the potential to sit with the terror of being alive and possibly alone in the cosmos.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3gPpCvw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of the cover of the book The Sirens of Mars&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089532&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070420_reviews_cover-sirens-298x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3gPpCvw&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Sirens of Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Stewart Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crown, $28.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sirens of Mars&lt;/em&gt; starts with a much broader view of Mars exploration. In lyrical, engaging writing, Stewart Johnson, a planetary scientist, chronicles how our perception of Mars has swung from a world teeming with life, to definitely dead and boring, and back again over and over since the invention of telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stewart Johnson brings together a cast of characters to tell this history, from Galileo to the present-day team working on the Curiosity rover. Those characters include astronomer Carl Sagan, whose &lt;em&gt;Cosmos&lt;/em&gt; TV series Stewart Johnson watched as a child. Sagan was almost ridiculed out of science for his obsession with “exobiology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also introduces less famous but equally important people, like Sagan’s colleague Wolf Vishniac, whose “Wolf Trap” life-detection experiment was cut from NASA’s life-hunting Viking landers in the 1970s. To get over his disappointment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/wolf-vishniac-1922-1973&quot;&gt;Vishniac went searching for microbes in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; and died in an accident there before the Viking missions launched (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/22/73&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this sweeping history of human fascination with the Red Planet, Stewart Johnson also tells a personal story of finding her place in the world, from an inquisitive child to an unrooted adventurer to a wife and mother and member of a scientific team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She makes a clear case that the search for life on Mars is an effort to not be alone. In one of the most poignant scenes in her book, she is hiking on Mauna Kea — the next volcano over from Greene’s Mars habitat — and finds a fern growing amid the volcanic desolation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was then, on that trip, that the idea of looking for life in the universe began to make sense to me,” she writes. “I suddenly saw something I might haunt the stratosphere for, something for which I’d fall into the sea…. a chance to discover the smallest breath in the deepest night and, in so doing, vanquish the void that lurked between human existence and all else in the cosmos.” &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: When Reminded Of Their Mortality, People Are More Likely To Donate Possessions That Allow Their Identity To Live On After Death</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39927</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/15/when-reminded-of-their-mortality-people-are-more-likely-to-donate-possessions-that-allow-their-identity-to-live-on-after-death/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortality is a weighty, often difficult topic. Some avoid thinking about it altogether, while others try to come to terms with it: research suggests a fear of death can be ameliorated by unexpected tactics including &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/14/low-self-esteem-and-scared-of-death-try-hugging-a-teddy/&quot;&gt;hugging a teddy&lt;/a&gt; or listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/18/songs-like-angel-of-death-protect-heavy-metal-fans-from-existential-angst/&quot;&gt;death metal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also been posited that a fear of mortality can lead to materialism: trying to accrue as many possessions or as much wealth before death as a way of managing existential terror. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucaa020/5823889?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;a paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that thinking about mortality might have a different impact on behaviour, making people more likely to &lt;em&gt;give away&lt;/em&gt; their possessions.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39927&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Lea Dunn at the University of Washington, first asked participants to bring along a favourite book that they would be happy to give to a local charity, &lt;em&gt;Books for All!&lt;/em&gt;, which helps families in poverty build their home libraries. Half of the participants were asked to imagine their own death and describe the emotions they felt, while the other half wrote about their typical day. Participants were then split into two different conditions: the signing condition, in which they were told to write a brief inscription before being asked to donate their book, and the no signing condition, in which they were asked to donate their book immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, participants who wrote about their own death were significantly more likely to donate than those who wrote about their day. But this was only true for those who had written an inscription in the book: thinking about death didn’t make it any more likely that people would donate an unsigned book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, participants again either wrote about their death or a typical day. They were then asked to describe a self-connected possession — something that they consider meaningful and close to their sense of self but which they no longer used (e.g. an old piece of clothing) — before being given information about a charity engaging in a goods drive. They were then told they would be donating their meaningful possession to the charity, and could choose to donate it with or without a short signed message on a donation nameplate. Those who had thought about their own mortality were significantly more likely to choose to include an inscription with their donation than those in the “typical day” condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that participants who thought about their death in these studies had a greater desire for “transcendence”: the idea that one is part of something greater than the self. An object that has a personalised message, and so has particular personal resonance, allows for this in a small way. It’s the same logic as a gravestone, or a park bench with a plaque on: a tangible way for someone’s legacy to continue beyond the physical self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further study the team looked specifically at transcendence as a motivator. Participants were asked to imagine joining an organisation they would be a member of for the rest of their lives: in the transcendent condition, they were told the organisation would always have a new generation of members, while in the non-transcendent condition participants were told it would cease to exist when its current members were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that members of the non-transcendent group who wrote about their death were more likely to donate a personal item to charity than those involved in the transcendent one — indicating that, for the latter group, their need for transcendence had already been met (indeed, these people were more likely to believe membership of the organisation would allow part of their identity to live on past their death).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the results held when participants were told their item could be broken up or recycled. The team suggests that a broken up item loses its potential for transcendence, and is therefore not seen as a way of continuing the self after death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, these findings could be useful for charitable organisations: fundraisers or marketers could use transcendence as a way to nudge people into donating. It may also work as a tool for selling consumer goods: positioning a luxury item as an heirloom, for example. However, this does come with some potential issues – being confronted with mortality isn’t always comfortable. Messaging would therefore have to be subtle or sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Competitive hot dog eaters may be nearing humans’ max eating speed</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3089596</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/competitive-hot-dog-eaters-humans-max-speed</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the race to scarf down as many hot dogs as possible in 10 minutes, competitive eaters may have a limit: 83 franks, buns and all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s according to an analysis of nearly 40 years of the storied Nathan’s Famous Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Contest. Started in the 1970s in New York City, the contest now is a televised international event. The current record of 75 hot dogs — set in July — is an improvement over the competition’s early days, where winners were crowned after eating a measly dozen or so dogs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;James Smoliga, a physiologist at High Point University in North Carolina, was watching the hot dog eating contest in 2019 when an idea struck him: Could he apply the mathematical equations used to estimate the limits of athletic performance to feats of gluttony?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoliga dug into the hot dog record books. Based on data from 152 competitors over 39 years, he calculated an &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0096&quot;&gt;upper hot dog limit of about 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. That translates to a consumption rate of about 832 grams per minute (and more than 23,000 calories total), Smoliga reports online July 15 in &lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Whether or not competitive eaters ever reach that limit, the scale of improvement “completely dwarfs other athletic achievements,” Smoliga says. Record performances in sports like track and field have improved about 40 percent since record keeping began, whereas hot dog eating prowess has improved approximately 700 percent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hot dog!&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the active consumption rates, measured in hot dogs swallowed per minute, of winners of the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. Circles represent 10-minute competitions, squares represent 12-minute competitions and the curve (black line) represents the mathematical equation that models the change in rates over time. Physiologist James Smoliga extrapolated a maximum rate of about 8.3 hot dogs per minute, or 83 hot dogs for 10-minute competitions, based on how individual performances deviated from the curve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;Consumption rate of winners of Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, 1980–2019&lt;/h6&gt;

Smoliga/&lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3089600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/071020_jl_hotdog_inline1_mobile_rev.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3089600&quot;&gt;J.M. Smoliga/&lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans even hold their own, pound for pound, against other meat-eating animals. When normalized for body mass, competitive hot dog eaters have a consumption rate that bests that of grizzly bears and coyotes, Smoliga reports, though wolves lead the pack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eating large quantities of food quickly can be a useful strategy for carnivores when food is scarce. And Smoliga says humans’ capacity for a relatively high consumption rate may have proved useful at some point in our evolutionary past. But nowadays, inhaling six or seven hot dogs a minute for 10 minutes mostly leads to digestive problems, and if you’re lucky, the coveted Mustard Belt of champions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number one cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is diabetes, and the gold standard for diagnosing any kidney disease is through biopsy. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-biopsy&quot;&gt;kidney biopsies&lt;/a&gt; are not without risks, and although minimal, there is a risk of bleeding and damaging the kidney further by performing this invasive procedure. In addition, some patients cannot have a kidney biopsy when they truly need one because of other comorbidities, anti-coagulant medications, and other factors that make them high risk for complications. Usually for patients with diabetes that present no other concerning findings, the nephrologist might assume its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/kidney-disease.html&quot;&gt;diabetic nephropathy&lt;/a&gt;, a complication of diabetes, without performing a kidney biopsy.  Could they be making a mistake?  It might be something else that is treatable.  Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;BMC Neprhology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01902-w&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, examine the potential use of specialized ultrasound – three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound – to diagnose diabetic nephropathy.  This technology takes a large series of 2-D ultrasound images in rapid succession which are then assembled by a computer to create a 3-dimensional image. For pregnant women, a 3-D ultrasound may have been offered to you to look at your growing baby.  Contrast enhanced ultrasound uses intravenous contrast agents consisting of microbubbles/nanobubbles of gas, which oscillate creating an “echo” when exposed to ultrasound waves. This is a better alternative when a patient cannot get contrast agents for a CT or MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-12008 size-shareaholic-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-1-640x452.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li and colleagues used these two technologies to examine 115 patients with diabetes and kidney disease that underwent kidney biopsy to see if they could differentiate between diabetic nephropathy from non-diabetic renal disease (i.e., IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy).  Sixty-four had diabetic nephropathy and 51 had non-diabetic renal disease. We know that diabetic nephropathy is more likely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/8/10/1718&quot;&gt;longer history of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and with other&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168822705000458&quot;&gt; microvascular complications&lt;/a&gt; (like retinopathy).  Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;’s data was consistent with these previous studies. They didn’t find any differences with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.  However, they did find that using a logistic regression model for BMI and right kidney volume was statistically significant.  They concluded that 3-D ultrasound has the potential to be an option in our arsenal for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; is one of a many researchers looking at utilizing 3-D ultrasound for diagnosing and managing kidney pathology.  Not surprisingly it’s been looked at for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306987/&quot;&gt;determining kidney volume in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009042951830774X&quot;&gt;Calio &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examined 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasound use in surveillance for renal cell carcinoma recurrence after ablation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my clinical practice, I’m not running out to get a 3-D ultrasounds just yet, but I’m keeping it in mind for the future. After further studies, I might be ordering it for that diabetic patient with chronic kidney disease to make sure I’m not missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Improving Research Assessment in the Triage Phase of Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18267</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Qzkv2xVliT0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Helen Sitar is the community coordinator for DORA and a Science Policy Programme Officer at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; EMBO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and Anna Hatch is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;’s program director. &lt;em&gt;DORA receives financial support from PLOS via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When seeking to fill an open faculty position, it’s common for universities to receive hundreds of applications for a single job. Unsurprisingly, such a high level of competition creates a bottleneck early in the hiring process. The ‘triage’ phase of review therefore becomes a critical point, as it determines which applicants receive further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ability to efficiently yet effectively triage applications has been a long-standing challenge for the academic community. Time constraints make triage prone to the influence of unintended biases and proxy measures of success, such as the journals where the candidate has published or their institutional affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, consistency between reviewers presents another challenge.  Even when selecting for the same purpose, processes and standards can vary greatly between individual reviewers or committees, due to differing assumptions about the process or the criteria for making judgments. Reviewers may prefer certain institutions, labs, or journals, or attach different values to funding track records. If reviewers are unaware of their own biases for certain community affiliations, these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-to-combat-bias-in-hiring/9a403c85-c162-4a28-9464-5ff2d5ea9371&quot;&gt;can influence decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, biased hiring processes impede underrepresented and minoritized scholars from making progress in their academic careers, resulting in inequalities in academic leadership and more. Without any intervention, one current model of postdoc to faculty transitions suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not increase significantly&lt;/a&gt; until 2080.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing three approaches to triage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stimulate discussion of the challenges associated with the triage process, and to identify possible solutions, DORA organized an interactive session for the 2019 ASCB | EMBO Meeting. Through a mock-review exercise, participants worked in small groups to test different approaches to the triage process. The seventeen participantsーrepresenting different groups and career stages, including postdocs, faculty members, administrators, publishers, and staff from other non-profit initiativesーwere given the description of a faculty position to ‘hire,’ general instructions on how to conduct the triage, and a set of anonymized application materials (CVs and cover letters). Because the session was limited to 75 minutes, other application materials, including letters of reference, teaching statements, and diversity statements, were not included in our informal exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application materials were anonymized, and the author names from the references listed in the bibliographies were also removed. A note under each reference, however, indicated the applicant’s position in the author list (e.g. “2nd author, 8 authors total”). The CVs and cover letters provided to two of the participant groups were further altered, by removing institutional names and journal titles when they were presented. One of these groups was provided with an assessment matrix to guide the evaluation of different competency areas: research, teaching and mentorship, equity and inclusion, and service to scientific or academic communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By informally experimenting with these triage approaches, our goal was to understand what information people use to make judgments during the triage phase. We were also keen to surface ideas about improving the triage process. Below we summarize the discussion and insights that emerged from our exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVs are littered with names, including those of applicants’ advisors, collaborators, coauthors, and references, which may yield strong associations for reviewers. These names can divert the reviewer’s focus from the work presented and onto the context and community in which it has been conducted. One way that names have the potential to mislead reviewers is through ingroup favoritism, wherein reviewers may gravitate towards the individuals that present affiliations most like themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, some individuals did not notice that names had been omitted from the application materials in our exercise. And others reported that it did not negatively impede the review process. Without names, participants found they became more attentive to the remaining details. For example, one group reported paying greater attention to the institutions where candidates received their training.  But relying on the names of institutions is also problematic, because they do not speak directly to the accomplishments or contributions of an individual, which should be the focus when hiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institution and journal prestige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the lack of institutional and journal names in materials did not detract from the participants’ ability to understand an applicant’s profile, as long as sufficient detail on their academic record had been included. Specifically, participants were interested in knowing how an applicant had contributed to the community at large, or to their department or research group, as this is a better indicator of their skills than their institutional affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Journal names were deemed generally unnecessary as well, especially when an applicant had provided a brief 2-4 sentence explanation summarizing what an article achieved and their specific contribution. This is not the first time DORA has received this feedback; it was suggested at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/1fd1018c/research-assessment-reducing-bias-in-the-evaluation-of-researchers&quot;&gt;previous conference session in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants who saw journal names in the application materials reported that they realized they were using them as a way of evaluation; these participants proposed that their assessments might have been fairer had the journal titles been removed. However, participants still wanted access to the articles’ DOIs to make papers easier to find, read, and evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One group reported that in the absence of journal names, they paid more attention to the author order and used this to determine the importance of the applicants’ contributions to each work. But others argued that knowing the authorship order for a publication did little to indicate an applicant’s role in contributing to a paper or project, and therefore was not particularly useful information. Tools like the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://casrai.org/credit/&quot;&gt;CRediT&lt;/a&gt;) can help parse apart how an individual contributed to an article or project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details instead of names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem with preferring candidates with well-known labs, institutions or awards named on their CVs is that by valuing reputation, departments narrow their search for talent to within known spheres. In doing so, they will miss out on hiring great researchers who have yet to be recognized by a prestigious award or hired into a well-known lab. When personal, institution, and journal names were removed at the same time in our exercise, some participants noticed that many CVs lacked details necessary to understand applicants’ skill areas. Some such details may have been in materials, such as teaching statements or reference letters, not available for the exercise. The reaction of participants to omission of these details from applicants’ CVs and cover letters underscores the importance of communicating one’s own research interests, approach to science, unique skills, and teaching and mentoring abilities. Only with this information can reviewers accurately evaluate candidates and suitability to a particular faculty role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was some disagreement regarding the necessity of including several details common to applicant CVs, including assessing candidates based on their receipt of awards or grants. Some participants paid close attention to mentions of grants, and attributed great value to the fact that an applicant had received an independent grant. Others debated the level of confidence one should have in a person’s abilities based on their receipt of grants, as this can contribute to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot;&gt;“Mathew effect”&lt;/a&gt; of people already recognized receiving further recognition because of previous awards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the triage process, it is clearly important for reviewers to be able to quickly find relevant information. The necessity of this was a major topic of discussion in our session, particularly when it came to the question of being able to compare candidates with ease. The lack of consistent organization of CVs made it complicated for participants to find the relevant information needed to make judgments of applicant’s strengths in various areas (e.g. research, teaching, leadership, inclusivity, service). Moreover, some applicants’ CVs were much longer than others, which reviewers found cumbersome as the length made finding specific pieces of information even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the need for organized CVs, the concept of a structured narrative format was mentioned in our discussions as an option to build consistency into the triage process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/&quot;&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2019/11/14/quality-over-quantity-how-the-dutch-research-council-is-giving-researchers-the-opportunity-to-showcase-diverse-types-of-talent/&quot;&gt;Dutch Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicv.ch/&quot;&gt;Swiss National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; are each experimenting with standard structured narrative CV formats. So far, the Dutch Research Council has received mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/04/14/doras-first-funder-discussion-updates-from-swiss-national-science-foundation-wellcome-trust-and-the-dutch-research-council/&quot;&gt;positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its new narrative. Reviewers report appreciating the added context the narrative format provides, and the Council has found that it leads to a more diverse selection of researchers. Some participants in our session, however, were skeptical of enforcing a standard template CV, noting that it could restrict creativity and limit applicants in describing work which may not fit neatly into any of the preconceived categories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing judgments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every reviewer has their own ‘way’ of sorting through applications, and specific criteria that they look for when deciding who to ‘keep’ or ‘eliminate’ in a triage round of review. In our session, participants using an assessment matrix advocated for a short discussion between reviewers to find a common set of standards before embarking on the triage process, as a way to increase consistent decision making and help minimize the effects of implicit bias. The Germans call this process towards reaching a collective agreement—‘&lt;em&gt;abstimmen’&lt;/em&gt;. Directly translated it means “off-voting,” or voting before one begins something. Asking reviewers to calibrate how they interpret the categories in the rubric would ideally result in more consistent assessment of all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overarching framing for the discussion was the tension between the need for efficient, accurate assessment versus the burden of devoting attention to details in every application. While some participants stated firmly that the use of rubrics may slow down the triage process, the group generally agreed that rubrics allow for uniform standards to be applied and that consistency should be valued. Still, a few others were resistant, stating that it was not desirable to ‘over-engineer’ the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universities and research funders are increasingly reconsidering the relevance and importance of researchers’ contributions when assessing them for hiring, promotion or funding. Across the DORA and wider research communities, there are numerous discussions on how to demonstrate the value of different contributions, whether it be via descriptive narratives, article-level metrics, teaching evaluations, or other means. The triage process is the front line to further review and consideration—and is therefore both important and influential in determining the makeup of the research community and its leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scholarly community has not yet reached a consensus regarding which methods for evaluation are best suited to different purposes or situations, and many believe that there will never be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to research evaluation. Yet demands for employment and funding continue to grow, resulting in more challenges for applicants and review committees in every selection process. And as the number of PhD graduates continues to exceed the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/digest/nsf16300.pdf&quot;&gt;available positions in academia&lt;/a&gt;, academics can expect the triage process for applications to become ever more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instilling standards and structure into research assessment processes, especially during the triage phase of review for faculty searches, appears to be a particularly robust option for reducing bias. To achieve this, universities can ask applicants to use a structured narrative CV template. Institutions can also develop evaluation assessment matrices and have conversations amongst reviewers to set standards and identify desirable applicant qualities and characteristics. By removing journal titles and replacing them with 2-4 sentence article summaries that articulate key findings and specify the researcher’s contributions, reviewers would be provided with information better suited to judging researchers’ contributions at the triage stage. When researchers and institutions reflect on and carefully choose what types of information are used to judge scholarly contributions, evaluation processes can be brought into alignment with community values.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Eating Lunch At Your Desk Again? Study Examines Why Workers Don’t Always Take Breaks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39923</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/14/eating-lunch-at-your-desk-again-study-examines-why-workers-dont-always-take-breaks/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work for more than six hours a day in the UK, you’re legally entitled to a rest break of at least twenty minutes per shift. Many workers get more; if you work an eight hour day, it’s likely your employer will give you an hour-long lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you actually take that break, however, is a different matter. Despite the fact that breaks can increase motivation and productivity and decrease potentially damaging inactivity, research has indicated a growing trend of workers eating their lunch at their desks or not taking their rest time. Some figures suggest 82% of workers don’t always take their breaks — a significant proportion of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is it that we’re so often eating al desko? A study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2020.1764954&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychology and Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has some insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39923&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mike Oliver and colleagues from Staffordshire University conducted five focus groups with 27 employees at a local council. These groups were separated by grade: two focus groups consisted of junior staff, two of middle managers and one of senior managers. Sessions lasted one hour, with a semi-structured interview approach which allowed consistency of questions with the freedom to take conversations in different directions based on individual contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions explored workers’ current experience of taking breaks — do or don’t they take them, and why? Participants were also asked how their relationship with their manager affects their likelihood of taking breaks, and what their attitude was towards the workplace as somewhere that affects their mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team identified five themes in the participants’ responses. First, participants reported fluidity in their taking a break: while there were some who always took a break and some who never took one, most sat somewhere between the two, seeming to view taking a lunch break as something that needed to be “booked in” like a meeting. Relationships with managers were also important — those who felt under no pressure to skip breaks were less likely to do so, unsurprisingly, than those who did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were also well aware of the fact taking breaks benefited their health and well-being — but still saw completing work tasks as more important. Feelings of guilt and anxiety about having taken “too much” time away from the desk were also prevalent. Finally, space was an issue — because participants often had nowhere to go, they ended up eating at their desk out of necessity and were subsequently seen as available for work related requests or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underpinning each of these five themes is the balance between work and health — a toss-up that, more often than not, work wins. The fact that most people don’t simply fall into two binary camps but rather are fluid in their decisions about taking breaks suggests that it’s not set traits or personality types driving those decisions, but context — what an organisation’s culture is like, or how individual line managers talk about breaks and work. Further research could explore these nuances further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout and design of offices could also be a fruitful avenue to explore — what does a healthy office building look like, and what could it include to ensure workers are taking breaks and staying active?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were limitations to the study. Though focus groups were organised by seniority and grade, it’s possible that subtle power dynamics were at play during the meetings, leading participants to answer in socially acceptable or desirable ways rather than being fully honest. The study also took place within a single, public sector organisation, and with a small number of participants — future research could investigate these themes in different groups, sectors and geographic locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to mandate break-taking — sometimes it might be necessary to work through a break, sometimes it’s just nice to not have to go and get lunch in the rain. But workplace well-being programmes should certainly take these sorts of findings into account: after all, insidious cultures in which bosses and colleagues pressure workers to cut short necessary break times are doing nothing but making workers less healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2020.1764954&quot;&gt;Understanding the psychological and social influences on office workers taking breaks; a thematic analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Growing Up With Grandparents In The House Can Lead To More Negative Attitudes Towards The Elderly</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39917</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/13/growing-up-with-grandparents-in-the-house-can-lead-to-more-negative-attitudes-towards-the-elderly/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if you grow up with a grandparent living in your home? Does the prolonged contact counter prejudices, biases and stereotypes of the elderly? Or might it instead encourage negative perceptions of older people as being &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=7ZbSCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR5&amp;amp;ots=o0yywbYjks&amp;amp;sig=AhM5A5Ebi1WhX8zaZ1ikRfGbZMk&amp;amp;redir_esc=y%23v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;slow, angry or sickly&lt;/a&gt;, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are important questions, partly because in some countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10433-018-0474-3&quot;&gt;though not all&lt;/a&gt;, an increasing number of elderly people are moving in with family members. In the US, for example, 15% of older adults are now living in someone else’s household, up from 7% in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-38901-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, by Brian T Smith and Kelly Charlton at the University of North Carolina, suggests that this trend could be causing undesirable outcomes: people in the study who had grown up with an elderly person had significantly &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; opinions of the elderly than those who had not. However, these respondents did at least report less anxiety around their own ageing process.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39917&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith and Charlton studied 309 Americans, all recruited online. Of these, 194 reported growing up with an older adult — and 80 of these people said that the older adult in their home had suffered from a serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the participants completed a series of surveys that explored, among other things, their current levels of contact with elderly people, the positivity (or otherwise) of this contact, their general attitudes towards elderly people, and also their anxieties about growing old themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that people who’d grown up with elderly people had lower opinions of older adults (this was especially true of those who’d grown up with an older adult who had been sick). The analysis also revealed that people in this group had greater levels of current anxiety about interacting with older adults. Overall, “our findings indicate that even years after a young adult has presumably moved out of the home, growing up in that home with an older adult had a significant negative effect on opinions of the elderly,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding contrasts with other work suggesting that contact with ‘out’-groups (such as minority groups) can counter prejudices. However, the researchers did observe that participants who had grown up with an older adult and who then managed to maintain frequent contact with elderly people did have more positive current opinions of older adults. Among this group, the older adult who’d lived at home was less likely to have suffered from an illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with someone with a mental or physical illness can cause chronic strain and impact the health of others in the house, the researchers note. It often means that everyone in the house becomes a caregiver and, as the pair writes, “the effects of being a caregiver are generally negative, associated with severe negative and physical outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, it’s surprising that people who’d grown up with an elderly person also reported being &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; anxious about their own ageing. But the researchers suspect cognitive dissonance could be at work here: “Younger adults who are faced with the realities of ageing (even if the older adult in their life is not seriously ill) may feel threatened by this. To reduce their discomfort at the idea of becoming older, they may tell themselves that their aging outcomes will be different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various limitations to the study. All the participants were American, so whether the same results would apply elsewhere is not clear. Also, the researchers didn’t ask the participants directly about their opinions of the older adult that they grew up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work does suggest that if a grandparent — especially a sick one — moves in to a family home, this will not necessarily improve the attitudes of children in the house towards older people. Parents may need to consider the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of the relationship their children have with older people in their lives, and do whatever they can to encourage a positive relationship — especially if a grandparent is sick.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Science represents perhaps the single greatest accomplishment of humankind. Of all human institutions, organisations and establishments, science has proven an effective tool for driving progress. It is inherently self-correcting, and tolerates — and even demands — skepticism, challenge and self-critique. Few human institutions can make a similar claim. However, there is increasing recognition and concern that … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/13/better-publishing-background-checks-a-way-toward-greater-integrity-in-science/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Better (publishing) background checks: A way toward greater integrity in science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rats are generally Good Samaritans: they help other rats in trouble, particularly when they’re in a group. &lt;/strong&gt;But after their companions are given drugs which make them passive, the rats seem to lose their willingness to help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/08/888767466/to-come-to-the-rescue-or-not-rats-like-people-take-cues-from-bystanders&quot;&gt;reports Nell Greenfieldboyce&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. The findings have similarities with the bystander effect in humans, where the presence of unresponsive bystanders can make someone less likely to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39905&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconscious bias training has been in the spotlight recently, after Keir Starmer promised that the Labour party will undergo such training&lt;/strong&gt;. And there’s of course no denying that people hold unconscious biases and prejudices. But, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2020/07/anti-racism-training-for-children-is-cruel/&quot;&gt;writes Tom Chivers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Unherd&lt;/em&gt;, the problem is that there’s very little evidence this kind of training, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;or the tools used to measure implicit racism&lt;/a&gt;, actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have discovered that hummingbirds understand the concept of numerical order, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/hummingbirds-can-count-their-way-food&quot;&gt;writes Cathleen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The team lined up ten artificial flowers, putting food in just a single one (the first flower, for instance, or the third one along). After the hummingbirds had learned which flower contained food, the researchers then shuffled the flowers around and moved the whole line to another location. But the birds still went straight for the location in the line where they expected the food to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditionally, prosthetic limbs have been designed to either be functional or to appear realistic.&lt;/strong&gt; But there’s another option: “expressive” prostheses, which allow an individual to express their own identity through the design of the limb, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/prosthetic-limbs-affect-our-attitudes-to-disability-expressive-design-might-change-things-for-the-better-140796&quot;&gt;writes researcher Anna Vlachaki&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Vlachaki and others have found that expressive prostheses can improve users’ well-being, and reduce negative attitudes from others in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many psychologists are worried about the effects the coronavirus pandemic is having on our mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;And there’s one group of people who may be particularly at risk of exhaustion and burn-out: the public health experts who have been working tirelessly throughout the pandemic&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/pandemic-experts-are-not-okay/613879/&quot;&gt;Ed Yong talks to these specialists&lt;/a&gt; about the toll the crisis is having on their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the crisis like for someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/05/ocd-coronavirus-cbt-mental-health&quot;&gt;Matthew Cantor has written a moving and insightful account&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, remember Brexit? Yes, that’s still going on — and the transition period ends on December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, so unless the country is going to leave with no deal, the UK and EU need to come to a compromise by then. &lt;/strong&gt;Will that hard deadline help move things along? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/brexit-deadline&quot;&gt;Sabrina Weiss looks at the psychology of deadlines&lt;/a&gt; and negotiations at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Cat People, Beware — Posing With Your Pet Could Make You Appear Less Dateable</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39896</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/09/cat-people-beware-posing-with-your-pet-could-make-you-appear-less-dateable/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to find love on a dating app, there’s plenty you need to think about: what to include in your bio, the interests you list, and what you say you’re looking for. And in an age of rapid swiping, you’re probably going to need a knock-out profile picture too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t be too quick to assume that a picture with your pet might boost your chances — at least if you’re a male cat owner, that is. According to Lori Kogan and Shelly Volsche, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32526856/&quot;&gt;writing in &lt;em&gt;Animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; men holding cats in photographs are seen as less masculine, more neurotic and ultimately less dateable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39896&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To look at the impact of cats on online dating success, the pair asked 1388 participants to complete a survey in which they saw two images of a man. In both pictures, the man was sitting in a chair against a white background, wearing a blue button-down shirt and jeans. In one picture, he was alone; in the other, he was shown with a ginger cat on his lap. The order in which participants saw these images were randomised. There were two different versions of this survey, each depicting a different man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39899&quot; style=&quot;width: 1140px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kogan and Volsche&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-39899&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39899&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Kogan and Volsche&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=845&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1140,364&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/09/cat-people-beware-posing-with-your-pet-could-make-you-appear-less-dateable/kogan-and-volsche/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;Half of the participants saw pictures of Man 1 (A) and half saw Man 2 (B). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/6/1007/htm&quot;&gt;Via Kogan and Volsche (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After viewing each picture, participants rated the men on several attributes including perceived personality (how extraverted, agreeable, neurotic, conscientious and open participants believed they were), perceived masculinity and femininity, and how dateable they were. Participants were also asked directly whether or not they would consider dating the man in either the short or long term, and whether or not they considered themselves to be a cat or dog person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of a cat did, in fact, have an impact on how the men were perceived. When Man 1 was pictured by himself, he was seen as more extraverted; when he was with the cat, he was seen to be more agreeable, more neurotic and more open, and less traditionally masculine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, women were also less likely to want to date the man when he was holding a cat than when alone, and tended to see him as less desirable for a long-term relationship. Unsurprisingly, women who considered themselves to be “dog people” were less likely to favour the cat picture version than women who thought of themselves as “cat people”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when Man 2 was holding a cat, participants’ didn’t see his personality as any different from when he was alone. However, he was again seen as less masculine and less dateable in the short term  (though he was no less desirable when it came to the potential for a long-term relationship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, fairly obviously, limitations to the study. These are big conclusions to form from small effects based on four images of two young white men, which Kogan and Volsche note themselves: the presence of cats, they write, may only be relevant to people looking to date a white male. Perceptions of masculinity are also dependent on factors like race and class, which further research may seek to explore. The strength of the findings are also somewhat undermined by the lack of effects for the second man, suggesting that other factors may also be at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also uncertain whether women would show similar preferences when seeing images of men with other pets. Including images of men with dogs as well as cats may have made differences in perceptions clearer. More naturalistic images could also change the way men are viewed when holding animals — the photos used in the study were clearly staged, which may have made an impact on the women’s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations aside, cat lovers may be feeling disheartened by the study. But don’t worry — if the results do reflect reality, you’re probably just saving yourself the heartbreak of accidentally shacking up with a dog person.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: What Makes A Good Robot Teacher?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39890</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/08/what-makes-a-good-robot-teacher/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young children, the biggest source of knowledge about the world is other people. Unsurprisingly, then, they have all kinds of strategies for deciding whom to trust — &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/11/kids-like-learning-from-confident-adults-but-only-if-their-confidence-is-justified/&quot;&gt;only learning from confident adults if that confidence has proven to be justified&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/08/young-children-trust-kindness-over-expertise/&quot;&gt;showing more trust in claims made by nice people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our world is increasingly filled with technological devices designed to impart information, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.19.2.148.pdf?seq=1&quot;&gt; educational robots&lt;/a&gt; are being used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/f3cbfada-668e-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&quot;&gt;teach children&lt;/a&gt; languages, maths, science, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2018-08-robot-teachers-invade-chinese-kindergartens.html&quot;&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. As Kimberly Brink and Henry Wellman at the University of Michigan write in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-36380-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;: “The rapid expansion of robot ‘instructors’ makes it increasingly important to investigate whether and when robots effectively transmit information to children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair reports on just such an investigation on pre-schoolers, with some fascinating results: to learn well from a robot, it seems that a child has to believe that it has some key human-like attributes. Without these, even a device that reliably gives accurate information is not trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39890&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For the first of two studies, Brink and Wellman recruited 60 three-year-olds. The children watched videos featuring two small humanoid ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/nao&quot;&gt;Nao&lt;/a&gt;’ robots and a woman who sat between them and interacted with them. These robots have limbs, moveable heads, eyes and a nose. In this experiment, they differed physically only in colour — one was purple, and the other orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first video, one robot correctly answered the woman when she asked about the names of some familiar objects, including a hairbrush and a teddy bear. The other robot got all the names wrong. (The colour of the accurate vs inaccurate robot was varied across the trials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came a video featuring images of unfamiliar objects (including blobby plastic objects). A researcher asked the child which robot they would ask for help to learn the names of these objects, and their answers were noted. Each of the robots then provided a made-up answer (one said “gobi”, for example, while the other said “danu”), and the child indicated which name they thought was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children were then asked about the extent to which they thought these robots had psychological agency — whether, and how much, they could choose to move and think for themselves, for example. They were also asked about perceptual experiences — how much they thought the robots could feel pain, for instance, or feel scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brink and Wellman found that children did indeed prefer to learn from the robot that had shown itself to be accurate, over the inaccurate robot. And, interestingly, children who more strongly attributed the ability to think and make decisions to these robots were more likely to favour the accurate robot. “These findings support the hypothesis that children are increasingly likely to treat social robots similarly to human teachers and monitor the robot’s accuracy when those robots engender perceptions of agency,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion was supported by the findings of the second study, which involved a fresh group of 47 three-year-olds. The study was the same as the first, except that instead of the two robots, the children saw two faceless blobs, described to them as “machines” (they looked a bit like plastic sea urchins), which did not interact with the woman. Instead, a hand came into view to pull a string to “activate their voice” (in fact, the same robotic voice as in the first study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the results were very different. While the children recognised that one machine was accurate in its initial responses, and the other was not, they did not go on consistently to trust the accurate one. And this time, whether a child inferred more or less agency made no difference to which robot they plumped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are interesting for all sorts of reasons. First, it seems that young children do trust — and mistrust — humanoid robots in the same way as people. But clearly, their opinions about the mental capacities of the information-giver are important for this. “At the least, psychological agency seems to be a critical factor in determining whether young children trust the testimony of social robots and may well be important more generally,” the researchers observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational devices range from humanoid robots to disembodied voices — like Apple’s Siri. More work is now needed to establish just how much — or little — psychological agency has to be inferred by a young child for it to trust a machine in the way it does a human informant. It may well also be the case that older children react differently, of course. Only further work will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, as the researchers write, the findings certainly do imply that when designing educational robots for young children, designers should bear in mind the impact of cues that suggest psychological agency. For this age group at least, evidence of accuracy alone is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-36380-001&quot;&gt;Robot teachers for children? Young children trust robots depending on their perceived accuracy and agency.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Psychology Research In The Coronavirus Era: A “High Stakes Version Of Groundhog Day”?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39882</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/07/psychology-research-in-the-coronavirus-era-a-high-stakes-version-of-groundhog-day/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the reality of the coronavirus pandemic set in in March, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;we looked at&lt;/a&gt; the work of psychologists attempting to understand how the crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. A few months later, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research&quot;&gt;hundreds of studies&lt;/a&gt; have been conducted or are in progress, examining everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the characteristics that make people more likely to obey lockdown measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some researchers have raised alarm. They’re worried that many of these rapid new studies are falling prey to methodological issues which could lead to false results and misleading advice. Of course, these aren’t new problems: the pandemic comes at the end of a decade in which the field’s methodological crises have really been thrust under the spotlight. But is the coronavirus pandemic causing researchers to fall back on bad habits — or could it lead to positive change for the field?&lt;span id=&quot;more-39882&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A methodological crisis…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past decade has been a turbulent one for psychology. Researchers have come to realise that a lot of psychological research rests on rather shaky foundations.  A pivotal 2015 study, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;attempted to replicate the findings of 100 psychology studies&lt;/a&gt; published in three influential journals, finding a significant effect for just 36 of the 97 studies that had originally found a positive outcome. Other replication attempts have cast doubt on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;well-known findings&lt;/a&gt; that appear in many introductory textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not all about reproducibility: even when findings do hold up, they don’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;generalise&lt;/em&gt; beyond the narrow group in which they were found. Most work focuses on participants who are Western and Educated and come from Industrialised, Rich and Democratic countries — an issue that has become known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/&quot;&gt;psychology’s WEIRD problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this will be news if you follow psychology research (or read this blog). And things have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/17/we-are-witnessing-a-renaissance-in-psychology/&quot;&gt;undoubtedly improved&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers are more aware than ever of the underlying causes of these problems. Increasingly, they are pre-registering their studies so that their methods and hypotheses are out in the open before they even begin collecting their data. Replication studies abound, weeding out those findings that fail to replicate. Large collaborations are popping up to study psychological phenomena with huge numbers of participants across multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.. meets a health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the COVID-19 pandemic. On the surface, psychology seems like it should have a lot to contribute in a crisis whose management relies on getting people to act in certain ways. But many researchers point out that the methodological issues that have come to the fore in the past ten years are all the more serious when it comes to an actual health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics say that evidence from past psychological research is simply too flawed or opaque to inform decisions that involve life-or-death situations — an argument perhaps best exemplified by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/whds4/&quot;&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; from Hans IJzerman from Université Grenoble Alpes and colleagues, which questions whether psychology is really “crisis ready”. The team explicitly call out the lack of generalisability and reproducibility in past work. How can we be sure that studies based on small, “WEIRD” pools of participants in very specific circumstances apply to a broad population in the midst of a crisis? Andrew Przybylski, Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute and co-first-author on that preprint, likens the situation to “a high stakes version of Groundhog Day”. Just because we’re trying to figure out how to respond to a crisis doesn’t mean that all of those issues that have come to light in the past ten years have just gone away, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, others have expressed more optimism about the role of psychology. This preprint was partly a reaction to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z.pdf&quot;&gt;review published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which Jay Van Bavel and colleagues outlined the ways that psychology &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; support the response to the coronavirus pandemic. While acknowledging that evidence is limited, the team make a number of suggestions based on past work, such as taking into account that people have an “optimism bias”, believing bad things are more likely to happen to others than themselves. And over at &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist,&lt;/em&gt; you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;dozens of perspectives&lt;/a&gt; from psychologists about how the field can help right now. Still, the debate about whether or not the field is “crisis ready” continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting our guard down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for many, that sense of repeating past mistakes also permeates much of the rapid research that psychologists have produced since the crisis began. Writing at &lt;em&gt;The 100% CI&lt;/em&gt; in late March, Anne Scheel from Eindhoven University of Technology &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the100.ci/2020/03/26/crisis-research-fast-and-slow/&quot;&gt;expressed worries&lt;/a&gt; that new studies attempting to understand the pandemic are being rushed out with major flaws: they may have a small number of participants and be underpowered, for instance. And there’s still the question of generalisability. Yes, these studies are being conducted in the context of the pandemic so are at least more relevant to the current situation. But they’re still conducted in an artificial environment — usually online —  and often consist of surveys that may not tap into how people think or behave in their daily life. And that WEIRD problem is not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, in “crisis mode”, researchers may be falling for the same old pitfalls that psychology has been trying to move on from in the past decade. “[I]t feels as if we’ve put our guard &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; rather than up,” Scheel writes.  Three months after typing those words, does she feel like things have improved? “My long-story-short answer would be: I’ve rarely felt so grimly vindicated,” says Scheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new scales to tap into attitudes and behaviours related to coronavirus have cropped up — but here too many researchers have expressed scepticism about the assumptions and methodologies used to develop these. Take the “Fear of COVID-19 Scale”, for instance, a seven-item scale that has already been translated into many languages and which asks questions like “I cannot sleep because I am worried about getting coronavirus-19”. The implication is that higher scores on the scale are bad; indeed, the authors write that the scale will “be useful in providing valuable information on fear of COVID-19 so as to facilitate public health initiatives on allaying public’s fears”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But another group found that people who scored higher on the scale were &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jkfu3/&quot;&gt;more likely to practise positive public health behaviours&lt;/a&gt; like social distancing. They suggest that rather than measuring some pathological “fear”, the scale may actually be tapping into adaptive negative emotions that help us respond to dangerous situations. Again, concerns about the validity of measures aren’t new (in fact, the same team recently made a similar argument that scales of “social media addiction” are really tapping in to normal, rather than pathological, social behaviour, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/15/are-you-addicted-to-spending-time-with-your-friends-study-satirises-measures-of-social-media-addiction/&quot;&gt;we reported in April&lt;/a&gt;). But these issues are arguably more problematic in a crisis situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to imply there aren’t many psychologists doing useful research right now —  indeed, you can read about some of the important work being done in areas like mental health in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s clear that the crisis has highlighted — and potentially exacerbated —  many of the field’s existing problems and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A way forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there have also been a number of suggestions for how to improve the research response. With calls for data sharing and collaboration, and the increased use of open science practices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/rapid-registered-report-coronavirus-aims-to-stop-researchers-following-false-research-leads&quot;&gt;like Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt;, there are some bright spots, says Przybylski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preprint that claimed psychology is not crisis-ready had one unlikely proposal: draw from rocket science. NASA uses a system of “technology readiness levels” to determine whether a new piece of technology is ready to be deployed. The first level indicates that researchers have reliably observed some principle that could help develop a technology; at later levels they have tested a piece of technology in an appropriate environment; and at the highest level they have successfully used the complete system in a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team writes that most psychological research findings haven’t even passed that first level: it’s still unclear whether many of the effects researchers have found are reliable, let alone whether they can be used in real-world interventions. So they suggest a psychological equivalent of NASA’s framework, called “Evidence Readiness Levels”, to guide the development and implementation of psychological research. Interestingly, they’re not the only ones who have suggested a NASA-inspired rating system. Another preprint from Kai Ruggeri and colleagues (including NASA chief scientist James Green) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/fjwvk/&quot;&gt;proposes a similar rating system&lt;/a&gt; that could allow decision makers to quickly assess the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have argued that the actual infrastructure by which psychologists communicate and share information needs to be adapted to better suit the crisis. Along with several colleagues, Ulrike Hahn at Birkbeck University of London has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scibeh.org/&quot;&gt;set up an initiative&lt;/a&gt; that aims to “reconfigure behavioural science for crisis knowledge management”. It’s a kind of meta-science project, says Hahn: “In a sense [it’s] trying to use extant tools to do something like build what the internet would be like, if the internet was still run by scientists, for scientists”. To that end, the team have set up subreddits where behavioural scientists can talk to each other and with policy makers and journalists, as well as a growing database of resources on psychology and the coronavirus.  Although the project is still in a proof-of-concept stage, the team hopes that these sorts of forums can facilitate the kind of speedy, transparent discussion and early evaluation of ideas and results that is necessary in a crisis, while also making information readily available to policy makers and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also highlighted the urgent need for more large-scale, collaborative studies. In an April paper in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry, &lt;/em&gt;for instance, a multidisciplinary team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30168-1/fulltext&quot;&gt;outlined priorities for mental health research&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Alongside various recommendations, the authors call for work to be conducted at scale with multiple research groups and networks, warning against “the current uncoordinated approach with a plethora of underpowered studies and surveys”. And at least some funding bodies and research councils are beginning to recognise the need to consolidate efforts in this way, notes Przybylski, who was also a co-author on this paper. Having large consortiums working together is “the kind of thing that I hope will eventually move psychology into the domain of ‘real science’ along with physics and chemistry,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That idea that improvements in our response to the pandemic could also lead to improvements in psychology more generally underlies many of these suggestions. Przybylski says that the notion of evidence readiness levels, for instance, “has been implicit in a lot of our thinking for a long time”, well before coronavirus emerged. Similarly, infrastructure that facilitates communication between researchers and builds an online community is always going to be helpful, says Hahn. “That kind of ‘ideal internet for science’ won’t stop being useful once the crisis has passed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whether or not the crisis does end up leading to long-term change remains to be seen. Some studies have already been published following rapid review, but most of the larger scale research will only hit the journals months or years down the line. Will we then look back at the pandemic as a time when psychological research held a strong line of defence and response, or when we let our guard down and allowed poor practices to spread?&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: “Want a Drink? Go on, you know you want to.” – Peer pressure to drink alcohol among UK adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11988</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/07/want-a-drink-go-on-you-know-you-want-to-peer-pressure-to-drink-alcohol-among-uk-adults/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/alcohol-492871_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have probably been in situations where someone offers you an alcoholic drink and you feel like you have to drink it. Or perhaps you offer people a drink and make sure that they join in the fun. Peer pressure to drink alcohol is common in our everyday lives; from parties, your local pub, to nowadays COVID-19 pandemic friendly social distancing beers on Zoom with your mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our systematic review of 13 qualitative research studies here are five key lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Peer pressure is not just experienced by adolescents and young people:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common perception is that peer pressure exists mainly in young people. However, peer pressure can affect people of all ages. The review found the adults often saw themselves as ‘older and wiser’ compared to when they were young. But many still experienced pressures to drink and continue drinking. Who hasn’t had the offer of ‘one for the road’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. People can feel threatened by peer pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer pressure experiences varied from friendly banter to aggressive forms of pressure where people felt alcohol was ‘forced on you’. Being encouraged to ‘keep up’ with others’ drinking was a common reason for drinking too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Peer pressure can have a negative impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, to get rid of peer pressure many people gave in and drank more alcohol. They either had a drink when they didn’t want to drink, or drank more than they had intended. Drinking alcohol in response to peer pressure was seen as ‘caving in’. Most people who drank as a result of peer pressure regretted this decision later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Our wider social context matters to build and keep up peer pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social surroundings often influenced peer pressure to drink. Drinking was seen as ‘a sociable thing’ – as normal and helping you to fit in. For men, drinking could also be seen as a way to show their masculinity, which included ‘drinking like a man’ and choosing manly drinks.  Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. People develop strategies to deal with peer pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many reported using strategies to avoid pressure. Strategies included ‘nursing your drink’, drinking alcohol-free options which mimic alcoholic in flavor and appearance, or driving their car to provide an excuse for not drinking which would usually be accepted. Some people who did not drink much alcohol ‘came out’ out about their drinking preference, but this seemed to be rare. Others selected their group of friends to make sure it included non-drinkers or those who only drank moderate amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time that you’re at a party, in the pub or having social distancing beers on Zoom, will you recognize when you are pressured to drink? Will you cave into the peer pressure, or have a strategy to deal with it? And what can you do to make sure that people don’t feel like they have to drink alcohol if they don’t want to?&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Santa Is More Real Than Peter Pan: Children Have A “Hierarchy” Of Belief In Fictional Characters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39877</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/06/santa-is-more-real-than-peter-pan-children-have-a-hierarchy-of-belief-in-fictional-characters/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creeping realisation that Santa isn’t real can be a watershed moment — not quite an entry into adulthood, but certainly a step in its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “real” and “not real” are not the only two categories that children have when it comes to cultural figures, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234142&quot;&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than a black-and-white model, Rohan Kapitány and colleagues propose a “sensible hierarchy” of belief in various figures, finding that cultural rites and norms for those figures play a big part in its creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39877&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Even very young children are capable of understanding the difference between real and non-real characters. But there are various factors that can convince them that a figure is real: testimony from others such as parents; indirect evidence like chocolate eggs or money left under a pillow; direct evidence like seeing a shopping centre Santa; and engagement in rituals — leaving cookies and milk out on Christmas Eve, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how children conceptualise and sort real from non-real figures, the researchers first asked 95 Australian children aged between two and eleven to rate the realness of 12 target figures on a scale from zero to eight. These included both real people (e.g. the kids’ band The Wiggles), and fictional figures (e.g. Santa, unicorns, and Harry Potter), as well as more ambiguous figures like aliens and dinosaurs. Adult participants also answered the same questions as part of a separate study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that children conceptualised the figures as belonging to one of four groups. The Wiggles and dinosaurs belonged to a “virtually real” group; cultural figures like Santa and the Tooth Fairy formed a second group; ambiguous figures like aliens made up another; and the final group included fictional characters like Peter Pan and Spongebob Squarepants. Adults, on the other hand, grouped figures into just three groups: real, not real and ambiguous. A second study with another set of children found a similar pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hypothesised, these groupings also conformed to a hierarchical pattern: the more culturally and evidentially supported a figure was, the more likely a child was to believe they were real. Unsurprisingly, the kids considered the “virtually real” group to be the most real — but they also believed that cultural figures were more real than other fictional characters. This makes sense when you consider the amount of “evidence” for the existence of Santa and Peter Pan, for instance: both are fictional characters, but only one has high levels of indirect and direct cultural evidence supporting it. Belief in fictional characters also, predictably, decreased with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study, however, was that children may also have been unclear on what “real” actually meant. In the case of Santa, many children may know he isn’t real in a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; sense but could have had experience “meeting” a figure in costume — 40% of children said they’d seen Santa in real life, the same number who said they’d seen The Wiggles, who are actually real. Dinosaurs, similarly, &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be real, which many children know. This knowledge may have impacted results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritual seems to be a key factor here. Santa and the Tooth Fairy, as figures used to enforce normative behaviour, have huge amounts of ceremony around them, both positive and negative — the fun of receiving money under your pillow or preparing for Christmas, and the threat that fun could be taken away because of bad behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work could look at ritual participation, and how different emotional states and interactions impact upon childrens’ hierarchy of beliefs, as well as possible cultural differences in such rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234142&quot;&gt;The child’s pantheon: Children’s hierarchical belief structure in real and non-real figures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being positive is all well and good — but when do messages of hope and happiness start to become toxic? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Shambles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicshambles.com/words/blogs/deanburnett/toxic-positivity&quot;&gt;Dean Burnett discusses the problem of “toxic positivity”&lt;/a&gt;, when people are told that they can or should simply choose to be happy, even in the face of adversity. It often comes in the form of trite sayings like “think happy thoughts”, which can leave people feeling that their negative emotions are not valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39868&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With many schools around the world still shut, lots of children are stuck at home without the usual chance to socialise with other kids.&lt;/strong&gt; How might that affect their social development? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/06/how-quarantine-will-affect-kids-social-development/613381/&quot;&gt;Lydia Denworth talks to the experts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve all seen the social media posts proclaiming that countries with female leaders are faring better in the pandemic than those with male leaders.&lt;/strong&gt; But while there are clearly prominent examples of women-led nations whose response has been excellent — Germany and New Zealand, in particular — is this claim actually true? The evidence is pretty weak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/what-the-data-really-says-about-women-leaders-and-the-pandemic/&quot;&gt;writes Hilda Bastian&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;em&gt; Wired&lt;/em&gt;, who points to the small sample size (as women still make up a small proportion of world leaders), as well as the confirmation bias that leads us to ignoring women-led countries that have not fared as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, even in workplaces where they &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;well-represented, women continue to face gender bias and discrimination. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers studied vets, a profession in which women make up the majority of employees, asking managers to assess the performance of a fictional worker. When they read that the employee was a woman, the managers believed they were less competent and recommended a lower salary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2246958-managers-who-think-gender-bias-isnt-a-problem-make-it-worse/&quot;&gt;reports Jessica Hamzelou&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. And, revealingly, this bias was only seen in managers who believed that gender discrimination wasn’t an issue in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The House of Lords Gambling Committee has called for loot boxes in video games to be regulated as gambling, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53253195&quot;&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have shown that there is a link between problem gambling and spending on loot boxes, which provide random rewards for players, though it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicshambles.com/words/blogs/peteetchells/the-trouble-with-loot-boxes&quot;&gt;complex area of research still in its infancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horror movie fans may be better equipped to deal with the distress caused by the pandemic, a preprint has claimed&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found that fans of horror — and particularly fans of movies in which society collapses — reported less psychological stress during the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/01/end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-fans-of-apocalyptic-films&quot;&gt;writes Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. This could be because watching these kinds of movies allows people to learn vicariously about how to act in disaster situations — although the authors do acknowledge that there could be some other third variable that is responsible for both turning someone into a horror fan and reducing their distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For our final link, something that’s not strictly psychology but fun nonetheless&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s become something of a meme that when scientists submit their work for peer-review, “Reviewer 2” is always the one to shoot down the paper with nasty comments. But a (not-entirely-serious) analysis of papers submitted to one journal has found that it’s actually Reviewer 3 that’s the problem. “Not only is Reviewer 3 the bad actor, but Reviewer 3’s crafty enough that they get Reviewer 2 blamed,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/empirical-analysis-tells-reviewer-2-go-f-yourself/&quot;&gt;researcher David Peterson tells John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Call for Papers! BMC Oral Health Collection: Something in the Water – Fluoridation and Caries</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/02/call-for-papers-bmc-oral-health-collection-something-in-the-water-fluoridation-and-caries/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/logo-bmcoralhealth-pr-140x90.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water fluoridation is a measure to prevent caries, a disease of significant public health importance. Caries, when not managed, result in pain and discomfort for individuals and have further implications for the health and well-being of the affected individual, such as retarded growth and development of pre-school children. The huge cost of managing caries has significant impact on the allocation of public health funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different management strategies have been employed to prevent caries. Behaviour based interventions to reduce individual’s exposure to caries’ risk factors such as a reduction in sugar consumption, have limited success. Public water fluoridation is a cost-effective approach to facilitate access of populations to systematic fluoride and, in turn, reduce caries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11995&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11995&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Water-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© samopauser / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of water fluoridation is still being extensively debated globally.  First, there is contradictory evidence on its effectiveness in preventing caries and there are reported risks of adverse effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. There are also debates weighing up the potential health benefits in the context of ethical principles and personal liberties.  Fluoridation reduces the risk of ill health in a manner which protects the vulnerable and reduces health outcome inequality between the different socioeconomic groups. Those who oppose fluoridation do so on the grounds that it is unethical to coerce individuals to live healthy lives, and emphasises the importance of consent before any health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the level of interest in public water fluoridation, the range and complexity of the public debate, and its implication for policy making, this Collection aims to bring together empirical research papers, and theoretical and conceptual analyses about water fluoridation and caries. The Collection will consider manuscripts on the following three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Population level impact of the introduction or the cessation of water fluoridation on health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barriers to the implementation of fluoridation and reasons for its cessation, including the assessment and evaluation of the attitudes and knowledge of members of the public, dental professionals and policy makers on water fluoridation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical arguments for and against water fluoridation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Self-Compassion Can Protect You From Feeling Like A Burden When You Mess Things Up For Your Group</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39863</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/02/self-compassion-can-protect-you-from-feeling-like-a-burden-when-you-mess-things-up-for-your-group/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/&quot;&gt;Itamar Shatz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels bad to know that you’ve messed up, especially when other people have to pay a price for your actions. Unfortunately, this feeling is something that most of us end up experiencing at one point or another — when we’re placed on a team with other people at school or at a job, for instance, and make a mistake that forces our team members to do more work as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000411&quot;&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; by James Wirth at Ohio State University and his colleagues, shows that there is a trait that can reduce those negative feelings, called “self-compassion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39863&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion is composed of three components: &lt;em&gt;self-kindness&lt;/em&gt;, which involves showing kindness to yourself, &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt;, which involves keeping your emotions balanced, and&lt;em&gt; common humanity&lt;/em&gt;, which involves recognising that everyone experiences challenges. Past work has shown that self-compassion can be beneficial from an emotional perspective, for example by &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/20/writing-about-your-emotional-pain-could-make-you-feel-worse-unless-you-do-it-with-self-compassion/&quot;&gt;protecting people who write about their emotional pain&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/17/encouraging-self-compassion-may-help-people-with-chronic-pain-live-more-active-happier-lives/&quot;&gt;helping people with chronic pain lead happier and more active lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see whether self-compassion could also protect people from the negative feelings that occur when they perform poorly in a way that hurts their group, the researchers conducted a series of online experiments, each with around 160 to 300 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, participants imagined playing a trivia game as part of a team. Some imagined that they performed as well as their team members, while others imagined that they performed poorly, and thus reduced the team’s number of correct answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second experiment, participants actually engaged in a team task, in which they saw three words, and had to find a fourth word that linked them together. Some participants were told that they performed as well as their team members (who were actually computer agents), while others were told that they performed worse and that as a result, the team did not get enough answers correct and would have to answer more questions as a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, when people performed (or imagined performing) poorly, they experienced more negative emotions, suffered from lower self-esteem, felt more burdensome and ostracised, and expected more exclusion from other group members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, self-compassion significantly reduced these negative outcomes: participants who were high in self-compassion did not experience as many negative emotions and concerns over being a burden as those who were low in self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two further experiments, the researchers attempted to untangle the effects of poor performance from those of harming one’s group. In one experiment, participants were either asked to recall a time when their poor performance harmed members of their group, or when they performed poorly but not in a way that harmed their group. In the other, participants engaged in the same word creativity task as before. This time, however, all participants were told that they performed worse than their team members, but some were told that their team would be impacted by this, while others were told that there would be no harm to their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies showed that when their poor performance also harmed other members of their group, participants felt more negative social consequences, such as feeling burdensome. Again, self-compassion seemed to buffer against these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study does have some limitations, as the researchers themselves note. For example, the experiments were conducted in an online setting, where participants did not directly experience the in-person social interaction that plays an important role in these kinds of situations. Still, it’s encouraging that most of the study’s main findings replicated across all of the individual experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings help explain why some people feel crushed when they make mistakes, while others manage to cope well. Furthermore, they suggest that practising self-compassion might help you cope with difficult situations where you feel you are being a burden on others. For example, if you’re part of a group project and you make a mistake, you could benefit from reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and that you shouldn’t be too hard on yourself if you do so. If you’re someone who’s not naturally self-compassionate, this may be difficult, but as the researchers note, with enough practice, it might be possible to increase your self-compassion over time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Why Do We Overestimate The Importance Of The Country We Live In?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39858</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/01/why-do-we-overestimate-the-importance-of-the-country-we-live-in/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What proportion of world history is the United Kingdom responsible for? While it’s clearly hard to put an exact number on it, you might be surprised by the answers participants gave in a 2018 study: on average, Brits believed that the country has contributed a whopping 55% of the total history of the world. And they weren’t alone: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/21/national-narcissism-is-rife-finds-survey-of-35-countries/&quot;&gt;participants from 34 other countries all rated their own nations&lt;/a&gt; as having outsized contributions, from 11% in Switzerland to 61% in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other work has found that people make similar claims about the regions they live in: one study found that Americans believe their own state is responsible for 18% of the nation’s history, despite just being one of 50 in the country. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-020-01059-9&quot;&gt;a series of studies in &lt;em&gt;Memory &amp;amp; Cognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has looked at exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people make these judgements, known as “collective overclaiming”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39858&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the new paper, Morgan Quinn Ross at The Ohio State University and colleagues studied the phenomenon through the lens of support theory. Simply put, this theory states that the way an event is described influences how likely we believe it is to occur. In particular, if an event is “unpacked” into its constituent parts, we generally see it as more likely. For instance, people believe that a plane crash is more likely when they think about the possible causes of plane crashes — human failure, terrorism, and so on — than when they just think about the likelihood of a plane crash in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of five studies, the team examined whether a similar kind of bias could account for our tendency to overclaim the contributions of a particular region. In the first, 302 participants read about a fictitious country, Oloram, and were asked how much the territory Adivigan was responsible for the historical developments of the country. Crucially, participants either learned that there were a total of 5, 20, or 50 territories, of which Adivigan was just one, and were told to keep in mind that the total contribution of all territories should equal 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any other information to go on, it would seem to make sense simply to estimate the contribution of Adivigan as a proportion of the total number of territories (i.e. 20% for the 5 territory condition or 2% for the 50 territory condition). And in the 5 territory condition, participants weren’t far off: on average they estimated that Adivigan was responsible for 23% of the country’s history. But participants considerably overestimated the contribution for the 20 and 50 territory conditions (average responses were 16% and 12% respectively, while the mathematically correct responses would be 5% and 2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study showed that the extent of overclaiming increased when there were more territories. The researchers suggest that this may be because with people’s focus concentrated on Adivigan, they tend to lump all the other regions together, rather than considering them as many individual territories (i.e. they don’t “unpack” them, in the language of support theory). This means people are prone to underestimate the role of these other regions — particularly when there are more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea further, the team asked a separate set of participants to complete a similar task, except this time they all read that Oloram had 5 territories. Some participants again rated the contribution of just one region, while the others rated all five. As expected, when the participants had to “unpack” the scenario by rating all of the territories, they were spot on, rating the contribution of each as 20%. But when they rated just one of the territories, they again overestimated its contribution at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a later study, the team looked at whether the amount of information given to participants influenced their judgements. In the “minimal content” condition, they simply read that Adivigan was one of Oloram’s 20 territories; in the “content” condition they were given facts about the territory (e.g. that it has prominent shipping and trade industries and boasts a popular forest); and in the “detailed content” condition they read more detailed information (e.g. that it has more than 30 financial institutions and several rare tree species).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all conditions, participants once again overestimated Adivigan’s contributions to the history of the country. But participants who received more information overestimated these contributions the most: those in the detailed content condition rated the contribution at 36%, compared to 14% in the minimal content condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that our tendency to overclaim may at least partly be the result of cognitive biases: we overestimate the contributions of the region that is most salient to us or that we know most about — whether that is Adivigan or the UK. And while in the real world there’s probably an element of nationalism at play as well, the fact that these biases were seen even for fictitious territories suggests that that can’t be the sole explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the findings also suggest a way to overcome this bias: by “unpacking” all the other alternative regions, rather than considering them as one entity. So, suggest the authors, learning about the history of other countries could help reduce the “inflated perceptions” you might hold about your own nation.&lt;/p&gt;

[Brain scanning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dana.org/article/fmri-still-not-a-mind-reader/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still not a mind reader&lt;/a&gt;.] An increasing number of media reports (and scientific studies) have shined a light on this fact: the mental life of one person differs from that of another, sometimes in startling ways. It's &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; been that way, but now it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Shock of the Unknown in Aphantasia: Learning that Visual Imagery Exists&quot;&gt;out in the open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The cat is out of the bag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;418&quot; data-original-width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading that sentence, did you have a fleeting mental picture in your mind's eye? Maybe it was clear, maybe it was hazy. Or maybe you saw no visual image at all... if that was the case, you might have a condition known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aphantasia&lt;/a&gt;, the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery. This is a normal variant of human experience, albeit an uncommon one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the “consequences” of having Aphantasia? You may be more likely to choose a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945220301404&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientific or mathematical occupation&lt;/a&gt;, although artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly exist. Aphantasia is often associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303568&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;(A)phantasia and severely deficient autobiographical memory: Scientific and personal perspectives&quot;&gt;poor autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt; (diminished ability to recall the past episodes of your life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Aphantasia affect your emotional reactions to ordinary experiences like looking at pictures or reading a story? If visual imagery is important for having an affective response to the shark story, would people with Aphantasia show physiological (bodily) signs of emotion while reading? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wicken and colleagues (2019)&lt;/a&gt; asked this question by comparing the skin conductance response (sweaty palms) evoked by reading vs. looking at pictures. This was a pilot study reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; (not yet peer reviewed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If visual imagery is necessary for an affective response to evocative stories, then A-Phantasics should have diminished (or absent) skin conductance responses (SCRs) compared to Typical-Phantasics. In contrast, SCRs to unpleasant pictures should not differ between the two groups, because the picture-viewing experience doesn't require imagery. However, it's still possible that imagery-based elaboration (or verbal elaboration, for that matter) could amplify the SCR, especially since each picture was presented for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;458&quot; data-original-width=&quot;616&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reading condition, stories were presented as sequential short phrases (to match reading speed across subjects). The control conditions weren't well-matched, unfortunately. This was especially true for Stories, where reading the task instructions served as the neutral comparison condition (instead of reading a neutral story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The participants were 24 individuals with intact imagery (based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aphantasia.com/vividness-of-visual-imagery-questionnaire/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;binocular rivalry priming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scores within the typical range) and 22 self-identified Aphantasics (who were older, on average, than the control participants).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  For the Aphantasia group, seven (out of the original 29) were excluded because their VVIQ or priming scores exceeded the cut-off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Pictures (Perception) condition, the physiological response to Unpleasant vs. Neutral stimuli was not significantly different for the two groups. Incidentally speaking, the skin conductance level (SCL = SCR) was quite variable, as shown in the shaded portion of the graph below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SPZcOuGx98/XvwQjLdsTEI/AAAAAAAANLc/i6OErZMEYt0G3O-9A8hCzQ4NDnKtxj91QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/perception%2Band%2BAphantasia_Fig%2B1D.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;324&quot; data-original-width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SPZcOuGx98/XvwQjLdsTEI/AAAAAAAANLc/i6OErZMEYt0G3O-9A8hCzQ4NDnKtxj91QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/perception%2Band%2BAphantasia_Fig%2B1D.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adapted from Fig. 1D (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wicken et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;).  Left:&lt;/b&gt; Aggregated progressions of baseline-corrected SCL across the duration of the frightening photos sequence (sampled as average across 5 sec time bins). &lt;b&gt;Right:&lt;/b&gt; Mean and standard error across time bins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stories were another story...

Nonetheless, this is an intriguing finding, with additional evidence forthcoming (or so I imagine)... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; See: &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/07/is-there-objective-test-for-aphantasia.html&quot;&gt;Is there an objective test for Aphantasia?&lt;/a&gt; Binocular rivalry priming can be a useful “objective” measure of aphantasia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keogh &amp;amp; Pearson, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), but it's not necessarily diagnostic at an individual level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Mean age = 33.7 yrs for Aphantasia, mean = 23.0 for controls.

When PTSD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; with alcohol or substance misuse, the risk for violence increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD only be managed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;not really treated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;ffective treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; for PTSD exist and include psychotherapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;as well as medication. While these options do not work for all people suffering with PTSD, most people will see reduction in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;symptoms,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; and many will even see remission of PTSD over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  If someone has mental health problems after a trauma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;always &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD is just one possible mental health problem that can occur following trauma. Since PTSD involves being haunted by a trauma memory, it is easily connected to a traumatic event. However, studies following people after exposure to trauma show that for some people trauma may result in other issues, such as depression, panic disorder, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;substance abuse, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;or even obsessive-compulsive disorder. Good assessment beyond just trauma exposure is necessary to provide the best insight into diagnosis and treatment of trauma survivors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; all in your head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD can feel like it is all in your head with the intrusive memories, feeling that you cannot connect to others, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;sense of feeling out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The impact of PTSD goes beyond just your brain and includes changes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;how your body reacts to stress and other normal processes. These changes can even result in weight gain and cardiovascular &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Misunderstanding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;PTSD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;and its causes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;contribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; to many people never seeking care or dropping out of care before they have had a chance to experience the benefits. In getting the word out about PTSD and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;the good news that there are effective treatment options, we hope that more people will seek care and experience taking their lives back from PTSD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image: Silhouette by Isai Ramos via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/YkFYP_zAT6k&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/five-questions-about-ptsd/&quot;&gt;Five questions about PTSD&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/629195946/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/629195946/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/629195946/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-to-experience-pandemic-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we experience pandemic time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-to-listen-when-debating/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to listen when debating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/testing-einsteins-theory-of-relativity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Testing Einstein’s theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Here’s How Our Personality Changes As We Age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39851</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once popular idea that our personality becomes “set like plaster” by the age of 30 has been refuted by studies showing that we do change —  &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/&quot;&gt;and can even purposefully change ourselves&lt;/a&gt;. Many studies have identified shifts in Big Five traits across the lifespan. However, the often inconsistent results have made for ongoing controversy about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; personality typically changes with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new analysis of data from 16 longitudinal studies, with a total sample of more than 60,000 people from various countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/per.2259&quot;&gt;reveals some important insights&lt;/a&gt;. The work, published by Eileen Graham at Northwestern University, Chicago, and her colleagues in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Personality Research&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that there are indeed some clear patterns of change through middle age and into older age for at least four of those five traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39851&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For all the studies included in the analysis (from the US, the Netherlands, Sweden, Scotland  and Germany), participants had completed an assessment of at least a subset of the Big Five traits (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness) on at least three separate occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the results, to consider the balance of evidence for the extent and direction of personality change over time. The way they did this was important. The team used a “coordinated integrative data analysis”, which allowed them to look for patterns in findings, but as the data was not pooled, they could also identify variations between different studies, and explore possible reasons for differences in results. They also looked for any links between personality changes and the participant’s sex and age group (under or over 60 years old) at the time of their first assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from the various studies were not all in agreement with each other. However, the team found fairly consistent evidence for some clear patterns of change for all of the traits, except agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both extraversion and conscientiousness showed a fairly steady pattern of decline with time. For conscientiousness, this decline was clearest among participants who were over 60 when they took the first personality test. This finding is consistent with several theories about personality change with age, the authors note, including the idea that for younger and middle-aged people, it’s advantageous to exhibit pro-social traits like extraversion and conscientiousness, but as social demands begin to wane in older age, so might these traits. Indeed, the team also found that openness, another prosocial trait, was stable through middle adulthood, before decreasing in older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroticism showed a different, U-shaped pattern. Overall, the data suggests that neuroticism decreases through most of adulthood, then increases again in older age. This is consistent with the idea that in old age, we tend to become anxious about terminal illnesses and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that sex was not relevant, except for neuroticism: females had slightly steeper declines through middle adulthood than males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the samples also revealed some individual differences in changes for all five personality traits — so, though there were these overall trends in changes, not everyone in each sample, or across the samples, changed at the same rate, or even in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work is now needed to understand why. As the researchers write, “people change differently on different traits, personality is not stable for everyone across the lifespan (but is for some people), and accounting for or explaining these changes is difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, though, the team would like to see more psychology studies using this approach. By not merging the individual data sets, this type of meta-analysis can not only help to clarify the picture of results in a given field, but also preserve the differences between studies, which could help with the increasingly popular exploration of differences — as well as similarities — between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/per.2259&quot;&gt;Trajectories of Big Five Personality Traits: A Coordinated Analysis of 16 Longitudinal Samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: LGBTQ2S+ People as a Disadvantaged Group in Healthcare</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/30/lgbtq2s-disadvantaged-group-in-healthcare/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Pride parade&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Pride-parade-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride Month is celebrated around the world in June to commemorate the 1969 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-uprising-50-years-lgbt-history&quot;&gt;Stonewall Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. Pride is both a celebration and a protest and encourages acceptance, solidarity, and visibility of LGBTQ2S+ people and their rights, including their right to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the general population, it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/about.htm&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; internationally that LGBTQ2S+ people experience poorer health outcomes, both psychologically and physically. These poorer health outcomes are a consequence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol2/iss2/6/&quot;&gt;healthcare disparities&lt;/a&gt;. That is, LGBTQ2S+ individuals face unequal burdens in healthcare which increases the incidence, or prevalence, of poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthcare settings, LGBTQ2S+ people are more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303049&quot;&gt;not receive appropriate healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2018/01/18/445130/discrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care/&quot;&gt;experience discrimination and harassment&lt;/a&gt;. Barriers to accessing healthcare bring harmful experiences for LGBTQ2S+ people. These experiences can have detrimental effects, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139&quot;&gt;decreasing the likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of seeking healthcare in the future, consequently leading to poorer health outcomes. This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are some of the common barriers in LGBTQ2S+ healthcare?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Barrier &quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-11982 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/barrier-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple unsolved barriers for LGBTQ2S+ people to access healthcare and here we touch on some examples. It is especially important to acknowledge that these barriers can be further exacerbated by a number of factors, including the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/how-covid-19-affecting-lgbt-communities&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, where, as an example, transgender people have been found to face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(20)30182-0/fulltext&quot;&gt;unprecedented and enlarged healthcare disparities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are limited numbers of healthcare staff trained to deliver healthcare that recognizes the needs of the LGBTQ2S+ people. Considering the risks of facing discrimination, LGBTQ2S+ people &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08834-y&quot;&gt;could hesitate&lt;/a&gt; to disclose information such as sexual orientation and how they identity to healthcare staff. This makes it difficult for healthcare personnel to appreciate the specific needs of the patient and to provide the most appropriate and holistic care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, The LGBTQ2S+ community continues to face severe inequalities in their access and provision of care, which is closely linked to governmental policy. Most recently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/health/trump-health-care-transgender-rights.html&quot;&gt;revised US Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt; has narrowed the definition of sex discrimination to the extent that it omits protections for transgender people in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, LGBTQ2S+ people can also experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace. LGBTQ2S+ people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223372&quot;&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a lower income, which can be a financial pressure and barrier to LGBTQ2S+ people accessing and using health services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can we remove the barriers in the future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Removing Barriers&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-11983 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Removing-Barriers-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously presented an LGBTQ2S+ &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-57192-008.html&quot;&gt;Health Equity Promotion Model&lt;/a&gt;, guiding LGBTQ2S+ people to consider both positive and negative health-related circumstances to reach full psychological and physical health potentials. But more research and work is needed to involve LGBTQ2S+ people in guiding the research agenda to promote the recognition of specific healthcare needs, whilst respecting the differences amongst the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant efforts need to be made to reduce health disparities and remove barriers to healthcare. Society should work together to promote healthcare equity, address and prevent LGBTQ2S+ poorer health outcomes, support LGBTQ2S+ people to access safe and inclusive healthcare, and work to eliminate healthcare disparities. It is essential to translate negative research findings in this context into reformative and progressive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the Samaritans launched what seemed like an innovative new project: Radar. Designed to provide what the charity described as an “online safety net”, users could sign up to Radar to receive updates on the content of other people’s tweets, with emails sent out based on a list of key phrases meant to detect whether someone was feeling distressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, this meant people could keep an eye on friends who were vulnerable: if they missed a tweet where somebody said they felt suicidal or wanted to self-harm, for example, Radar would send it on, in theory increasing the likelihood that someone might get help or support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, things weren’t so simple. Some pointed out that the app could be used for stalking or harassment, allowing abuse to be targeted during someone’s lowest point. There were false positives, too — “I want to kill myself”, for example, is often used as hyperbole by people who aren’t actually distressed at all. And others felt it was an invasion of privacy: their tweets might be on a public platform, they argued, but they were personal expression. They hadn’t consented to being used as part of a programme like Radar, no matter how well meaning it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samaritans shut down Radar just a week after launch. But since then, the use of social media data in mental health research — including tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, and blogs — has only increased. Researchers hope that the volume of data social media offers will bring important insights into mental health. But many users worry about how their data is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39844&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media’s role in research continues to grow. In February of this year, a team from King’s College London made headlines with a paper in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; that found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57835-9&quot;&gt;days with particularly high volumes of depression and schizophrenia-related tweets also saw higher numbers of crisis episodes&lt;/a&gt; at mental health service providers in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of using such data are clear, says Anna Kolliakou, lead author of the paper. The volume of data would have been otherwise impossible to obtain, for one, and there was potential to gain insight into the “opinions and experiences of communities that transcend location”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KCL team hopes that monitoring tweets at a population level could predict mental health service activity and help manage strained services. But others have looked at whether social media data could also tell us something about &lt;em&gt;individuals’ &lt;/em&gt;mental health. A 2017 study looked at the course and onset of PTSD using Twitter data, for instance, suggesting that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5636873/&quot;&gt;language of people’s tweets could provide early hints they would develop the condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2018 researchers found  that the use of “language predictive of depression” on Facebook – sadness, loneliness, hostility and more – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/11203&quot;&gt;could predict whether a user was depressed&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases a full three months before they received a formal diagnosis. The paper’s authors suggested that such predictive data could be used to screen (consenting) adults for depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to studies looking to help at-risk individuals, Sarah Knowles, an NIHR Senior Research Fellow in Knowledge Mobilisation at the University of York, is “very sceptical of accuracy and validity, and what they’re intended to achieve”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t ever seen a convincing example of how targeting an individual on social media helps them personally, and it’s perhaps more likely to make them feel isolated or even attacked,” she says. “Some people use social media as an outlet for difficult feelings, and worrying about being ‘tagged’ as at-risk might shut this down, so you’re potentially removing a coping strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowles also points out that a high number of people who seek help find it difficult to access (figures vary, but the Mental Health Foundation suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics/mental-health-statistics-people-seeking-help&quot;&gt;75% of people with mental health problems in England&lt;/a&gt; may not get access to the treatment they need). Framing mental health as a problem of “detection” is therefore missing the point, she argues. And programmes like Radar ultimately “comfort onlookers who are worried about someone, rather than help the person expressing a problem”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if algorithms could help identify those who are at risk, there are still questions about whether such tools are wanted. A survey published in late 2019 found that although people may see the value of using algorithms to detect mental illness from social media data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/30/public-wouldnt-trust-companies-to-scan-social-media-posts-for-signs-of-depression-survey-finds/&quot;&gt;they don’t actually trust social media platforms&lt;/a&gt; with their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just academic arguments — Facebook is already using an algorithm in some countries to detect suicidal ideation in posts, with the aim of providing help to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company says that machine learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2018/09/inside-feed-suicide-prevention-and-ai/&quot;&gt;is only one part of its efforts to help people who are struggling&lt;/a&gt;: in a blog post, its head of product development writes that “technology can’t replace people in the process, but it can be an aid to connect more people in need with compassionate help.” For those with concerns about the ethics of machine learning in this context, however, that reassurance is not likely to go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public or private?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the studies that used Facebook and Twitter data to predict PTSD and depression, participants had consented: they knew what their data was being used for. But one of the appeals of social media data for many researchers is the ability to scrape information from so-called “public” datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this might not be as straightforward as it seems, at least ethically speaking. A study in &lt;em&gt;Social Media and Society&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305118763366&quot;&gt;many users don’t believe that researchers should use their tweets for research&lt;/a&gt; without permission. Another was more mixed, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0105-5&quot;&gt;some users feeling positively&lt;/a&gt; about their data being used for mental health monitoring, at least when anonymised. But others were still not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this tension, research using data scraped from Twitter without consent continues. One study &lt;a href=&quot;https://mental.jmir.org/2018/4/e61/&quot;&gt;used tweets from a hashtag&lt;/a&gt;, “#MyDepressionLooksLike”, to identify communities tweeting about  depression; another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3207.pdfhttps:/www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3207.pdf&quot;&gt;looked at the language used&lt;/a&gt; by people who had tweeted that they were affected by PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of those who share online are sceptical. “I know that an argument in favour of this would be that once people speak on public platforms, they inherently give permission for that content to be used,” says Sarah-Louise Kelly, a content writer who lives in Glasgow. “But I disagree.” Kelly wrote a blog for many years, starting from her teens; many of her posts included accounts of depression, OCD, anxiety and trauma. She’s recently limited her tweets and blogs about mental health, but says she still tries to be open about “the peaks and troughs” of her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 30, Kelly notes that she’s “from a generation that used the internet as a diary”: she’s “never grown out of the mindset” that sharing online can bring community, catharsis and solidarity.  She also feels uncomfortable about her data being used in research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If tweets or blogs of mine have been used in research, I really resent that I’ve never been contacted,” she says. “Where’s the gain for me and my community? I have to pay for my own therapy, I have to work out my own coping mechanisms, I learn nothing. I understand the importance of these studies and don’t want to undermine them. But social media users deserve to be treated as more than case studies when they’re discussing such intimate problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin*, in his 40s, initially joined Twitter for news updates, but he soon found himself part of a community of people who shared his experiences with poor mental health. “It was really important to me because not everybody in my life knew I was unwell — I had a job at the time I was terrified of losing,” he says. Martin, in a new role and a new relationship, is now able to be more open, and he uses Twitter less to talk about his own experiences with mental illness. But, like Kelly, he’s unhappy with the idea that personal posts could be used as research data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were things I posted online that, at that time, I wasn’t saying to anybody else,” he says. “I was talking about bad experiences with mental health services, stigma, knowing that I was speaking to an ‘audience’, if you will, that would understand what I’d gone through. The idea of that being scraped from Twitter and used in research doesn’t really sit right with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that he doesn’t want to contribute to learnings about mental health — he points to several Covid-19 related surveys on mental health that he’s completed over the last few months alone. But consent is important. “I read a lot about mental health, I’m interested in the area in general, so this isn’t an anti-research stance. But any [research] I’ve been involved with — that I know of, anyway! — has been something I’ve willingly opted into. That should be the case with everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin’s experience with healthcare services has also been mixed: he’s been “invalidated” by psychiatrists and other healthcare workers, and mentions that many of those from his Twitter community have experienced the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously researchers are not psychiatrists and they’re not responsible for my treatment or care,” Martin says. “But when you’ve been in a situation where you feel that you’ve not been treated with due respect or you’ve had your voice taken away from you, it’s even more important that anything that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; related to mental health involves giving full consent. That’s something I know a lot of people feel strongly about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading the fine print&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some object to the potential use of their posts, others aren’t aware that it’s happening at all. The &lt;em&gt;Social Media and Society &lt;/em&gt;study found that many users were unaware public tweets could be used by researchers, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://howwegettonext.com/scientists-like-me-are-studying-your-tweets-are-you-ok-with-that-c2cfdfebf135&quot;&gt;as co-author Casey Fiesler noted&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter or Facebook privacy policies don’t seem to increase awareness, even when they are clear about how users’ data could be used. “As we know,” she wrote, “most people don’t read privacy policies.” Plus, she said, many people don’t have a good understanding of how far their social media posts really reach. Kelly also raises this point: “Lots of people treat social media like an extension of community; they think they’re speaking just to their followers.” When posts are used as part of research, however, that community inadvertently gets a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowles feels strongly that social media data should not be automatically available to use at all. “It’s [people’s private] information, and they should be able to have reasonable expectations about being informed if someone else wants to reuse it.” Think about a coffee shop, where you can sit and have a conversation with a friend about your health. “That’s public,” she says. “But we all know you shouldn’t sit down, eavesdrop, and assume you have the right to take away and use what was said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that researchers are throwing away all conception of ethical data collection when working with social media: Knowles says that many researchers are wary of using social media data at all, and that approvals from ethics committees for such work can be demanding too. She’s more worried about commercial organisations — like Facebook — using universities’ procedures as a benchmark for conducting social media research. If universities haven’t got a clear set of ethical standards yet, following in their footsteps may not be the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolliakou agrees that ethical consideration is paramount: “researchers have an obligation to handle this data like they would any other research project — privacy and confidentiality should be the utmost priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she’s also hopeful that use of social media data could have a big impact on the prevention of illness or distress. “There have been great advances in developing systems that could automatically identify individuals experiencing a crisis,” she says. “The question is whether this is at all acceptable. This is a complex research issue still at its infancy, and until we have some concrete findings that it actually works, uninvited contact with users should not be made. Intervening with individuals unaware their information has been used is invasive and not appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names have been changed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual illusions occur because our brains construct stories about how things should look, based on our experiences and expectations, which don’t always match up with reality. &lt;/strong&gt;And with a greater understanding of how we (mis)interpret the visual world, perhaps we can also come to understand the more complicated biases in our thoughts and behaviour that have led to the polarised political climate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/20978285/optical-illusion-science-humility-reality-polarization&quot;&gt;writes Brian Resnick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;. Aside from being a great read, the story contains some really nice examples of visual illusions that I had never come across before.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39840&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-responses-highlight-how-humans-are-hardwired-to-dismiss-facts-that-dont-fit-their-worldview-141335&quot;&gt;Adrian Bardon has more on polarisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; People have a tendency to ignore evidence that threatens their worldview, a process called “motivated reasoning”, Bardon explains. This can help explain why simply providing information is not necessarily enough to tackle issues like climate denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has lockdown left you feeling exhausted? &lt;/strong&gt;You’re not alone: with our routines and normal habits all shaken up, many of us are faced with making a bunch of decisions every day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200623-the-real-reason-lockdown-is-exhausting&quot;&gt;writes William Park&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt; — and this can be very tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending time outside in green spaces &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/09/22/we-underestimate-the-benefits-of-nature/&quot;&gt;benefits our mood&lt;/a&gt; and mental health — so lockdown has been particularly hard for many of those living in apartments in crowded cities.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/parenting/nature-health-benefits-coronavirus-outdoors.html&quot;&gt;Meg St-Esprit McKivigan talks to&lt;/a&gt; families struggling without access to green space (though many psychologists would likely dispute the article’s claim that “nature deficit disorder” is a real condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the early 1990s, the world became aware of the plight of thousands of children growing up in awful conditions in Romanian orphanages. &lt;/strong&gt;Psychologists who went to work with the orphans learned a lot about child development and the effects of neglect. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/&quot;&gt;Melissa Fay Greene has written a heart-breaking feature&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, which describes the challenges these children have faced, and looks at how they are coping today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many scientists have challenged the notion that only papers published in peer-reviewed journals are of good quality — or that peer-review &lt;em&gt;guarantees &lt;/em&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt;. And now the coronavirus pandemic has really highlighted the limitations of the publishing process. Researchers are making coronavirus-related preprints available as quickly as possible, to ensure that information is shared more rapidly than the review process would allow, while several high profile, peer-reviewed journal papers have recently been retracted. At &lt;em&gt;Wired, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/peer-reviewed-scientific-journals-dont-really-do-their-job/&quot;&gt;psychologist Simine Vazire discusses the issues&lt;/a&gt; with the traditional peer-review process, with some suggestions for how to improve things for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, if you know any young people interested in science, a great resource is &lt;em&gt;Frontiers for Young Minds&lt;/em&gt;: an open-access journal which publishes papers written for — and reviewed by — kids.&lt;/strong&gt;   This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2020.00075&quot;&gt;neuroscientists Kathryn Mills and Jeya Anandakumar explain&lt;/a&gt; why the adolescent brain is “literally awesome”, in a nice article that includes one of the best figures I’ve ever seen in a paper.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re Not Very Good At Identifying Illness From Sounds of Coughs and Sneezes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39832</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/25/were-not-very-good-at-identifying-illness-from-sounds-of-coughs-and-sneezes/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, most of us are on red alert when it comes to sounds of illness, with sniffling in the supermarket or coughing behind us in a queue the cause of significant alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we might like to think we’re able to tell the difference between someone clearing their throat and somebody who is genuinely unwell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0944#d1e255&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt; suggests we’re less good at identifying threats than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39832&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To investigate how well people can detect pathogen threats from cough and sneeze sounds, Nicholas M. Michalak from the University of Michigan and colleagues first recruited 148 participants to listen to 20 audio clips of coughs and sneezes taken from online videos. Half of these sounds were from people who were genuinely ill with colds or the flu, whilst the other half merely had allergies or had consumed powdery spices and were therefore non-infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each clip, participants indicated whether they thought the sound was from someone with an infectious or non-infectious condition, and were also asked how certain they were about their answer. Finally, they completed an index of disease concern, which measures worries about contracting certain illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But participants were no better than chance at correctly identifying infectious and non-infectious coughs and sneezes, with 45% accuracy across the board and no difference when it came to each type of sound. Participants were reasonably certain about their judgments — but, in fact, for those who were more certain were actually &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at the impact of disgust on identification of infectious sounds. The team played the same sounds to 146 participants — only this time, in addition to identifying the sounds, participants were also asked how disgusting they found them. Again, participants were no better than chance (42%) at detecting infectious or non-infectious coughs and sneezes, and increased certainty was related to decreased accuracy. Disgust did have an impact, however: the more disgusting participants found a cough or sneeze, the more likely they were to judge it as having an infectious origin, regardless of whether it was actually infectious or not. A third study replicated these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems as if we’re more likely to perceive something as a threat if we find it more disgusting — but that that assumption fails to serve us in terms of accuracy. This may be a protective measure: it’s probably safer, in the long run, to presume something innocent is actually infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments here only contained audio, and the team notes that people may be much better at identifying infectious sounds when integrated with other sensory information — if somebody sneezes and also has a hoarse voice and bags under their eyes, we’re probably going to know they’re ill; if they’re holding a spoon full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_challenge&quot;&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; ready to do a viral challenge, they’re probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling the difference between an innocent and infectious cough feels like a useful thing to be able to do, particularly considering the current situation. But, as this research shows, we’re not actually very good at it. “Thus, the next time you hear someone cough or a sneeze”, the team concludes, “perhaps leave the diagnosis to the doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0944#d1e255&quot;&gt;Sounds of sickness: can people identify infectious disease using sounds of coughs and sneezes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Fathers’ mental health: why is it important?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11973</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/22/fathers-mental-health-why-is-it-important/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/image-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting fathers’ mental health into perspective &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a father is an extremely important life event for a man. Fathers can experience new emotions, feelings, and changes initiated by the transition into parenthood. Some evidence shows that around &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185905&quot;&gt;10% of new fathers experience depression&lt;/a&gt;, and yet this is still little understanding about this let alone appropriate support. Most new mothers perceive the father to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03701.x&quot;&gt;crucial source of support&lt;/a&gt;. Poor paternal support can exacerbate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajan.com.au/archive/Vol33/Issue1/4Wynter.pdf&quot;&gt;maternal mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;. However, many &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1229-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;fathers feel alienated and have little knowledge&lt;/a&gt; about how they can support their partner at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, around 98% of fathers are present at the birth of their child. If that birth becomes traumatic, the father witnessing these events can also become traumatized. While research exists about the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-88?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;birth trauma on mothers&lt;/a&gt;, little is known about the impact on fathers. Some evidence shows that fathers encountered ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1259-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;a rollercoaster of emotions, characterized by isolation and abandonment&lt;/a&gt;’ when witnessing their partners’ birth trauma. Previous studies have shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://fn.bmj.com/content/97/6/F439&quot;&gt;fathers get little information and support&lt;/a&gt; in the event of a traumatic birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers’ mental health matters for many reasons; we need to understand more about how we can help dads. My recent research has sought to explore that in more depth, while my campaigns urge better support for fathers. It’s not about support for fathers instead of mothers; it’s as well as. If we help fathers, we help mothers. If we help them both, we also help their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My research with fathers’ mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my work has focused on three areas: what information and support fathers need to help their wife/partner should they experience poor mental health in the perinatal period; what support we need to give to fathers to deal with their own mental health in the perinatal period; and what information and support we need to give to fathers should their wife/partner experience what might perceived to be a traumatic birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently finalizing work on our research focusing on what support we need to give to fathers to manage their own mental health in the perinatal period, while the other two areas have been addressed in our recent papers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fathers and birth trauma &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02902-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; of fathers who witnessed their partner’s traumatic birth, 61 fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given. From those responses, three main themes were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Fathers’ understanding after the experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dads told us that ‘nothing could prepare them’ for the experience. One father said, “&lt;em&gt;At no point was there any explanation to either my partner or myself to calm the situation&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers also confirmed that they felt the experience was ‘not about them’, as one dad expressed his exclusion:  “&lt;em&gt;No. I’m the male. My presence was often not acknowledged let alone my feelings&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Life after birth trauma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fathers expressed concerns about what happened after the event:  “&lt;em&gt;The trauma of my son’s birth put me immediately into what felt like sole-responsibility for my entire family 24/7, ultimately excluded me from colleagues and friends and I struggled to cope&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trauma clearly had an impact on many of the fathers’ mental health. One father told us he was “&lt;em&gt;Upset, distressed and unable to cope very well. It was a feeling about the fragility of life during the birth and the overwhelming nature of the birth and the subsequent days&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some fathers, the traumatic experience had an impact on the relationship with their partner and infant. For example:  “&lt;em&gt;I wanted to be with my wife but I felt guilty that I didn’t want to be with the baby. When I was with the baby I didn’t feel the level of love that everyone says you do and I felt guilty about that&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11975 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/pic-300x244.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Support fathers received vs. what they wanted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers told us that they were not getting that support from healthcare professionals. One father said, “&lt;em&gt;I should have been more included from the beginning. A mother and father should both complete questionnaires regarding depression and a father should be asked how he is feeling or if there is anything that he wants to ask or doesn’t understand. These questions are solely aimed at the expectant mother whilst a father has to butt in and speak during a conversation he is only there to witness&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fathers supporting partner’s poor postnatal mental health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03043-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; sought to explore fathers’ experience of their partners’ postnatal mental health. Twenty-five fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given when their partner became unwell. From their responses to an online questionnaire, we revealed several important themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Fathers not getting enough support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the amount of support received, one father told us “&lt;em&gt;I didn’t know how to help her.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fathers felt that any support given was of a poor quality. One commented that the support offered “…&lt;em&gt;didn’t cover anything about the father and I felt lost&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Fathers not getting enough information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers told us that they felt poorly informed. For example, one dad reflected on how he desired a “&lt;em&gt;…basic understanding of depression and how to help when dealing with psychosis episode&lt;/em&gt;s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Having someone to talk to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fathers would welcome having someone to talk to. One father explained how “… &lt;em&gt;a specialist to sit with me and explain the situation and care plan&lt;/em&gt;” would have been useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Fathers Mental Health Day is a global event illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  Health professionals not taking fathers seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fathers said that they experienced very little help from the health professionals caring for their partner. One said, “&lt;em&gt;My wellbeing was of little interest to midwifes, health visitors… I had not given birth so had no cause for sympathy. A leaflet for my wife and a page for the fathers to read which wasn’t enough&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global impact for fathers’ mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the outcomes from our latest research show that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health, including the impact of birth trauma, and for helping their partner should she need support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, June 22, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postpartum.net/news-and-blog/ifmhd/&quot;&gt;International Fathers Mental Health Day&lt;/a&gt; (IFMHD; the day after Fathers’ Day each year). In addition to research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andrewmayers.info/index.html&quot;&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt; involves campaigning for better perinatal mental health. I lead the UK side of IFMHD with global campaigner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reachingoutpmh.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mark Williams&lt;/a&gt;. IFMHD is led in the USA by Daniel Singley (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.menexcel.com/&quot;&gt;The Center for Men’s Excellence&lt;/a&gt;) with support from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postpartum.net/&quot;&gt;Postpartum Support International&lt;/a&gt;. Bronwyn Leigh, Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centreforperinatalpsychology.com.au/&quot;&gt;Centre for Perinatal Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, leads from Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFMHD is a global event that shares blogs, videos, research and news items illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters. In recent years, truly powerful stories have been posted across &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ifmhd&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dadsMHday/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and we have featured in some noteworthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/when-postpartum-depression-stole-my-husband/2019/09/06/e560822c-be07-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html&quot;&gt;global print and broadcast media&lt;/a&gt;. Publicity and evidence from IFMHD and other research-led campaigning has enabled us to influence change in mental health support services for fathers, at least in the UK. Research by groups such as ours helped persuade NHS England to begin screening fathers for their mental health for the very first time. We hope that our new evidence, highlighted here, will have similar impact, perhaps even beyond the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Academic precarity and the single PI lab model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1741</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brilliant young scientists are struggling to obtain a stable faculty position, all over the world. It seems that “publish or perish” was actually quite hopeful. Now clearly, at least in biology, it is more like “publish in Science, Nature or Cell every other year or perish”. Only a small proportion of PhD holders manage to obtain a stable academic position, and only at an advanced age after multiple postdocs. Of course, this competition for publishing in certain venues also has a great impact on science; encouraging dishonesty and discouraging both long-term creative work and solid incremental science. Everyone complains about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we do about it? What I hear most frequently is that governments should increase the budget and create more faculty positions. That is certainly necessary but I think it is a reductionist view that largely misses the point. Of course, at the time when you start hiring more faculty, the proportion of young scientists who get a faculty position increases. However, if each of them then opens their lab and hire dozens of postdocs, then this proportion quickly reverts to what it was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is at stakes is the general organization of research, in particular the “X lab” model (e.g. the Brette lab), with one group leader (the “PI”) surrounded by a number of graduate students and postdocs (I will discuss only the research staff here), with a complete turnover every few years. It seems that in many countries, to get a faculty position means to start their “own” lab. This is not the case yet in France, but this lab model is spreading very, very fast. With the new law on research currently in discussion (“discussion” might not be the appropriate word, though), it is planned that about 25% of all new recruitments will follow this model (a tenure-track system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math is easy. In a stable world, each faculty member will train on average one student to become a faculty member. For example, if a typical lab consists of 1 PI with 3 graduate students, rotating every 4 years, then over 40 years the PI will have trained 30 students, one of which would become a PI. The “success rate” would therefore be 1/30. Even with just one student at any given time, the chance for a student to end up getting a faculty position is 1/10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one does not necessarily pursue a PhD with the goal of obtaining a faculty position. It is completely respectable to do a PhD then go to the industry. In many countries, holding a PhD is an asset. It is generally not the case in France, though. One may also want to do a PhD not for career, but because it is interesting in itself. This seems perfectly valid. Note that in that case, implementing a subtask of the PI’s project and doing all the tedious bench work might not be ideal. In any case, it must be emphasized that in this lab model, training students for research is only a marginal aim of a PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about postdocs? A postdoc is not a diploma. It typically doesn’t improve employability much. Of course, it could be done just for its own interest. But the experience I hear is mostly that of a highly stressful situation, because many if not most postdocs are hoping to secure a stable faculty position. Let us do the math again, with a simplified example. Suppose each lab has just 1 postdoc, rotating every 4 years. Compared to the above situation, it means that 1 out of 3 graduate students go on to do a postdoc. Then each of these postdocs has a 10% chance of getting a faculty position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us have a look at funding questions now. What seems very appreciated is that when you start a lab, you get a “start-up package”. There is a blog post on Naturejobs entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/11/16/the-faculty-series-top-10-tips-on-negotiating-start-up-packages/&quot;&gt;The faculty series: Top 10 tips on negotiating start-up packages&lt;/a&gt;” that describes it. We can read for example: “&lt;em&gt;There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it. One of the largest costs you can expect to come out of your start-up fund are the salaries of PhD students and postdocs. They’re the most crucial components of the lab for almost all researchers&lt;/em&gt;.”. It is very nice to provide the PI with these “components of the lab”, but as argued above, a direct consequence is to organize academic precarity on a massive scale. This remains true even if the entire budget of the State is allocated to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for the rest of the funding system. Project-based funding is conceived so that you hire people to implement your project, which you supervise. Part of these people are students and postdocs. For example, an ERC Starting Grant is 1.5 million euros for 5 years, or 300 k€ per year. In France, a PhD student costs about 30 k€ / year and a postdoc about the double. Of course, to that must be added the indirect costs (25%) and the grant also covers equipment and your own salary. But this is generally sufficient to hire a few students and postdocs, especially as in many countries graduate students are funded by other sources. Then the budget goes up to 2 million € for the consolidator grant and 2.5 million € for the advanced grant. The ERC has become a sort of model for good funding schemes in Europe, because it is so generous. But is it? Certainly it is for the PI who receives the grant, but a world where this mode of funding is generalized is a world where research is done by a vanishingly small proportion of permanent researchers. It is a world that is extremely cruel to young scientists, and with a very worrying demographic structure, most of the work being done by an army of young people with high turnover. You might increase the ERC budget several fold because it is such a great scheme, it will not improve this situation, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending academic precarity is a noble cause, but one has to realize that it is inconsistent with the one PI - one lab model, as well as with project-based funding. I want to add a couple of remarks. Precarity is obviously bad for the people who experience it, but it is also bad more generally for the academic system. The excessive competition it generates encourages bad practices, and discourages long-term creative work and solid incremental science. We must also look beyond research per se. The role of academia in society is not just to produce new science. It is also to teach and to provide public expertise. We need to have some people with a deep understanding of epidemiology that we can turn to for advice when necessary. You would not just hire a bunch of graduate students after a competitive call for projects to do this advising job when a new virus emerges. But with a pyramidal organization, a comparatively low proportion of the budget is spent on sustaining the most experienced persons, so for the same budget, you would have much lower expertise than in an organization with more normal demographics. This is incredibly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the alternative? Well, first of all, research has not always been organized in this way, with one PI surrounded by an army of students and postdocs. The landmark series of 4 papers by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 on the ionic basis of neural excitability did not come out of the &quot;Hodgkin lab&quot;; they came out from “the Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge”. The Hubel and Wiesel papers on the visual cortex were not done by graduate student Hubel under the supervision of professor Wiesel. Two scientists of the same generation decided to collaborate together, and as far as I know none of their landmark papers from the 1960s involved any student or postdoc. What strikes me is that these two experienced scientists apparently had the time to do the experiments themselves (&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the experiments), well after they got a stable faculty position (in 1959). How many PIs can actually do that today, instead of supervising, hiring, writing grants and filling reports? It is quite revealing to read again the recent blog post cited above: “&lt;em&gt;There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it.” &lt;/em&gt;- as if using it yourself was not even conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, the 1 PI - 1 lab kind of organization has been taking on gradually over the last 20 years, with a decisive step presumably coming this year with the introduction of a large proportion of tenure tracks with “start-up packages”. This move has been accompanied by a progressive shift from base funding to project-based funding, and a steady increase in the age of faculty recruitment. This is not to say that the situation was great 20 years ago, but it is clearly worsening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable, non-pyramidal model is one in which a researcher would typically train no more than a few students over her entire career. It means that research work is done by collaboration between peers, rather than by hiring (and training) less experienced people to do the work. It means that research is not generically funded on projects led by a single individual acting as a manager. In fact, a model where most of the working force is already employed should have much less use of “projects”. A few people can just decide to join forces and work together, just as Hubel and Wiesel did. Of course, some research ideas might need expenses beyond the usual (e.g. equipment), and so there is a case for project-based funding schemes to cover for these expenses. But it is not the generic case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fantasies of competitive project-based funding is that it would supposedly increase research quality by selecting the best projects. But how does it work? Basically, peers read the project and decide whether they think it is good. Free association is exactly that, except the peers in question 1) are real experts, 2) commit to actually do some work on the project and possibly to bring some of their own resources. Without the bureaucracy. Peer reviewing of projects is an unnecessary and poor substitute for what goes on in free collaboration - do I think this idea is exciting enough to devote some of my own time (and possibly budget) on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the problem of academic precarity, of the unhealthy pressure put on postdocs in modern academia, is not primarily a budget problem. At least it is not just that. It is a direct consequence of an insane organization of research, based on general managerial principles that are totally orthogonal to what research is about (and beyond: teaching, public expertise). This is what needs to be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Probabilistic Optimization Algorithms for Real-Coded Problems And Its Application in Latin Hypercube Problem</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2020-06-17:/2020/06/17/probabilistic-optimization-algorithms-for-real-coded-problems-and-its-application-in-latin-hypercube-problem.html</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about paper &quot;Probabilistic Optimization Algorithms for Real-Coded Problems And Its Application in Latin Hypercube Problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm for read-coded problems called the Probabilistic Optimization Algorithm (POA). In the proposed algorithm, rather than a binary or integer, a probabilistic representation is used for the individuals. Each individual in the proposed algorithm is a probability density function and is capable of representing the entire search space simultaneously. In the search process, each solution performs as a local search and climbs the local optima, and at the same time, the interaction among the probabilistic individuals in the population offers a global search. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are studied in this paper and their effect on the search process is presented. A structured population is proposed for the algorithm and the effect of different structures is analyzed. The algorithm is used to solve Latin Hyper-cube problem and experimental studies suggest promising results. Different benchmark functions are also used to test the algorithm and results are presented. The analyses suggest that the improvement is more significant for large scale problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/17/eular-2020-highlights-from-the-european-e-congress-of-rheumatology/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Welcome to EULAR 2020 e-Congress visual&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/eular1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rheumatology at the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic was the elephant in the room throughout this e-Congress. Delegates sat behind their screens to view lectures and asked questions using a chatbox function. Only minor technical issues occurred, honestly to be expected in this new era of conference attendance. And while &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carmona_loreto/status/1268161577011773440&quot;&gt;17,500&lt;/a&gt; attendees connected on Day 1 of the e-Congress, the typical media channels, e.g. Twitter, appeared significantly quieter than &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/07/03/eular-2019-highlights-from-the-annual-conference/&quot;&gt;2019’s edition&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Editorial Board Members at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;remarked to me that clinical and household duties interfered with their ability to engage fully in this meeting. Good thing that all lectures and conference resources are online until 1 September 2020!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11969&quot; style=&quot;width: 420px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11969&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/covid2-300x162.png&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Take home messages from EULAR’s provisional recommendations on the effects of COVID-19 on patients with RMDs. Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Landewe&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prof Robert Landewé&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has become part of our medical reality, and the scientific programme demonstrated this. Prof &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Landewe&quot;&gt;Robert Landewé&lt;/a&gt;, University of Amsterdam, led an opening session on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/05/annrheumdis-2020-217877.long&quot;&gt;EULAR recommendations&lt;/a&gt; related to the management of RMDs in the context of COVID-19. He noted that rheumatologists are well-placed to manage coronaviruses, given that i) they understand the immune system, ii) their medical speciality is used to treating multiple organ systems at once, and iii) rheumatologists often use the immunotherapy drugs currently being trialled in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Machado provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable talks included &lt;a href=&quot;https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PMMAC99&quot;&gt;Dr Pedro Machado&lt;/a&gt;, University College London, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/29/annrheumdis-2020-217871.full&quot;&gt;reported the first findings&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rheum-covid.org/&quot;&gt;Global Rheumatology Alliance database&lt;/a&gt; on the outcome of COVID-19 and impact of rheumatic disease therapy on 600 patients across 40 countries. He provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers analysed rheumatic patient data and studied potential hospitalization and course of COVID-19 infection, valuable data given its scarcity to date. The intake of glucocorticoid steroids, of anti-malarial drugs (e.g. hydroxychloroquinine), and of TNA-alpha inhibitors were associated with an increased, no change, and reduced probability of hospitalizations, respectively. Most patients with RMDs recovered from COVID-19 irrespective of their medication choice, and treatment regimens should proceed with vigilance. As this study was associative and not causative, well-designed clinical trials are needed to inform future medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProfJohnIsaacs&quot;&gt;John Isaacs&lt;/a&gt;, University of Newcastle, then talked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/23.2&quot;&gt;increased risk of rheumatic patients&lt;/a&gt; suffering from venous thromboembolism, a blood clotting complication that can kill one third of those affected. Since these blood clots play a serious role in how COVID-19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003&quot;&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt;, new research indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/8.2&quot;&gt;TNF-alpha inhibiting drugs&lt;/a&gt; reduce thrombotic risk by lowering inflammation. Increased awareness of such complications and maintenance of therapies is therefore recommended in people with arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirsten_Hoeper&quot;&gt;Dr Kristen Hoeper&lt;/a&gt; explained that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24659148/&quot;&gt;~50% of patients with RMDs&lt;/a&gt; received inadequate medical care. One new study from Germany demonstrated that patient care in rheumatoid arthritis by ‘rheumatological assistants’ (i.e. specialized nurses) is just as effective as treatment by rheumatologists. Given the pressures SARS-CoV-2 is currently placing on healthcare systems, EULAR, therefore, advocates an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/61&quot;&gt;integrated team approach&lt;/a&gt; comprising rheumatologists and other health care professionals in the management and psychological support of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. As telemedicine grows in parallel, the face of patient care is changing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other interesting talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of patients with osteoarthritis are taking pain-relieving opioids, such as tramadol and codeine. Recent European &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/174.1&quot;&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; found that consumption of opioids in patients has increased from 15% (2007) to 25% (2016), even when &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/58.2&quot;&gt;anti-inflammatory drug treatment begins&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/118.1&quot;&gt;risk of death&lt;/a&gt; during the first year of opioid treatments compared to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was significantly higher in another study. Calls for doctors to use these analgesics more safely is advised, given their abuse potential, and other pain control methods are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early implementation of patient and public involvement (PPI) in research, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and high-intensity exercise into rheumatology care was evident by the symposia on offer at this e-Congress. The field of rheumatology is ahead of the curve in recent years, so it may not take long until automated scoring of radiographic images and prescriptive exercise are incorporated in other clinical disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11970&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-11970&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/ali3-1024x498.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Re-connecting online with those I enjoyed meeting at EULAR 2019 and whom I was prevented seeing in person. Pictured with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oarsi.org/ali-mobasheri&quot;&gt;Ali Mobasheri&lt;/a&gt;, Section Editor at &lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, &lt;/em&gt;and Abigail Jones, Journal Development Editor at &lt;em&gt;Arthritis Research &amp;amp; Therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First thoughts on virtual conferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback. However, the scientific content did not significantly suffer by the switch to virtual. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.eular.org/organising_committees.cfm&quot;&gt;EULAR steering committee&lt;/a&gt; should be commended for pivoting their content online and launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eular.org/eular_virtual_research_center.cfm&quot;&gt;Virtual Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;, a hub to accelerate research into RMDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally adapted by re-connecting online with those I enjoyed meeting at EULAR 2019 and whom I was prevented from seeing this year. Others, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://emeunet.eular.org/&quot;&gt;EMEUNET&lt;/a&gt; (Emerging EUlar NETwork), hosted a networking event on the virtual world platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondlife.com/&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;. Behavioural adaptions such as these may be necessary in 2021, if we cannot meet in Paris for the next EULAR Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: “So you didn’t feel so alone”:  The value of online support for new mothers with perinatal anxiety, especially in isolation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11955</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/17/so-you-didnt-feel-so-alone-the-value-of-online-support-for-new-mothers-with-perinatal-anxiety-especially-in-isolation/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/feature-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perinatal anxiety, which refers to the experience of distressing anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and up to a year after childbirth, is fairly common. In fact, research suggests under ‘normal circumstances’ around 1 in 5 women may experience significant levels of anxiety in the perinatal period. However, it seems likely that this proportion may be even higher as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and preliminary evidence we are collecting appears to support this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the prevalence of perinatal anxiety, fewer than 50% of women experiencing symptoms will seek help or receive treatment (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nct.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/hidden-half-campaign&quot;&gt;NCT’s #hiddenhalf campaign&lt;/a&gt; for more details). This is problematic, as research suggests that untreated perinatal anxiety may be associated with a number of long- and short-term consequences for both mother and baby, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032709001797&quot;&gt;premature birth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adc.bmj.com/content/99/9/800&quot;&gt;excessive infant crying&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791845/&quot;&gt;bonding issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-009-0109-y&quot;&gt;developmental and mental health problems in children&lt;/a&gt;. So it is important that we better understand, recognize, and support women who may be suffering from perinatal anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed some light on this, we recently held focus groups to explore women’s experience of anxiety in the perinatal period and gain insight into their opinions of online support. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02990-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out before the pandemic began, some of the findings may be particularly relevant at a time when we are social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Triggers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study identified a number of specific sources of anxiety for women in the perinatal period. These included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lockdown, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1) A mismatch between mothers’ reality and their expectations of childbirth and motherhood.&lt;/em&gt; Both social media and traditional media contain romanticized depictions of what pregnancy and having a baby should be like, which can set unrealistic expectations about motherhood and can lead women to feel anxious and like they have failed when their experiences don’t quite match up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I just struggle with parenthood being completely honest. It’s like one of these things where there’s so much social media these days saying how you should be this and that. And for me that’s actually, like the biggest thing that really blocks me from thinking actually it’s OK, like this is normal.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; (2) Uncertainty and maternal confidence.&lt;/em&gt; Related to point 1, many women described struggling with the adjustment to motherhood. In line with a plethora of research that shows a significant link between anxiety symptoms and feelings of uncertainty, women in this study found the unknowns of pregnancy and motherhood to be particularly anxiety-provoking. They felt generally underprepared which often translated into a lack of maternal confidence and feeling like they weren’t doing it ‘right.’ This uncertainty stemmed from a general lack of experience with and knowledge about key aspects of motherhood, from giving birth to changing nappies and feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That’s actually why people then struggle. I suppose we all go through our lives being good at a lot of things. You’ve established a career, you’ve established yourself, you’ve got qualifications. And then suddenly… this baby arrives and you’re not good at anything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(3) A lack of support. &lt;/em&gt;Most women a spoke about motherhood being isolating at times, which was a large source of distress. Those who were far away from friends and family felt this was a particular source of anxiety. This may be of particular concern under lockdown, especially as most women in our study highlighted that their peers were the single most important source of support in the perinatal period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(4) Mental health literacy.&lt;/em&gt; A lack of recognition and knowledge about perinatal anxiety itself also contributed to anxiety symptoms, as women often didn’t know what was wrong with them. While many were able to find information about postnatal depression, few identified information about the anxious symptoms they were experiencing, which led them to feel distressed, confused, and increasingly anxious. This lack of knowledge and uncertainly about their situation acted as both a barrier to seeking support and as a trigger for spiraling anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11960 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-471401853-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Online Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key aims of the study was to explore women’s opinions of existing and potential online strategies for supporting perinatal anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, women in the study thought the Internet could be a valuable source of support for women experiencing perinatal anxiety. Specifically, they felt that being able to access unbiased evidence-based information about parenthood and anxiety itself could alleviate some of the uncertainty that underlay their anxiety symptoms. However, they were generally unable to find information on perinatal anxiety specifically. To address this, we have now developed an open-access website that provides evidence-based information explicitly about perinatal anxiety. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openpaws.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Open P.A.W.S.&lt;/a&gt; for access to more information, screening tools, self-help guides, and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, women were able to use the internet to access peer support, which also had the power to breakdown idealized notions of motherhood. While our research suggests using large forums (such as Mumsnet/Netmums) may be more anxiety-provoking than relieving, many mums found smaller targeted groups really helpful. These offered an opportunity to form virtual relationships with mothers in the same position as themselves, and hear more realistic stories of parenthood which could normalize their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So we just post whatever’s going on. So if you’re having a really naff day you’ll say Jesus Christ, the kids have done this, this and this. And someone goes oh tell me about it. And it’s just somebody, like, who’s feeling the same thing as you, so it’s not completely like… all the social media where it’s this perfect mum… it’s well I’m here with cereal stuck in my hair and it’s two o’clock in the afternoon. So at least with that it was other normal mums that were just like yeah, I’m doing the same thing as you. So you didn’t feel so alone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation and lockdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lockdown, when feelings of isolation are likely to further exacerbate anxiety symptoms, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful. Finding reliable, realistic sources of information about perinatal anxiety (such as OpenPAWS) and targeted peer support (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1732740973652517&quot;&gt;The Perinatal Mental Health International Online Peer Support Group&lt;/a&gt;) is likely to be particularly beneficial in alleviating symptoms of anxiety during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantlib.org/&quot;&gt;QuantLib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine&quot;&gt;Open Source Risk Engine&lt;/a&gt; (ORE), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system&quot;&gt;libbitcoin&lt;/a&gt;and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a &lt;i&gt;deep understanding&lt;/i&gt;of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: &lt;i&gt;wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1&quot; id=&quot;fnr.1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The situation &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2&quot; id=&quot;fnr.2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html&quot;&gt;other complex domains&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that's that for the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;. But, just &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; exactly are we researching? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org038ff83&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain &quot;trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS&quot; - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when we lack competence to do so&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3&quot; id=&quot;fnr.3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours &quot;Computational Finance&quot;. Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/&quot;&gt;Wolfram's writings&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, &lt;i&gt;everything is interconnected with everything else&lt;/i&gt;, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let &lt;i&gt;taste&lt;/i&gt; be my guide&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4&quot; id=&quot;fnr.4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are &quot;intuitive&quot; boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5&quot; id=&quot;fnr.5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org81de0c9&quot;&gt;Audience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target audience for this material is the fabled &lt;i&gt;homo developus&lt;/i&gt;, that non-existent &quot;standard developer&quot; - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the &quot;finance&quot; part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those &lt;i&gt;not in the know&lt;/i&gt;, so slowness is unavoidable&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6&quot; id=&quot;fnr.6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets &quot;plain&quot; software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org04a295b&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering &lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt;perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our core belief is that an &lt;i&gt;average reader&lt;/i&gt; (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of &lt;i&gt;how things work&lt;/i&gt; just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/&quot;&gt;Experimental Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codingthematrix.com/&quot;&gt;Coding the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org3d4740f&quot;&gt;Cryptos&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of &lt;i&gt;everything else&lt;/i&gt;. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as &lt;i&gt;cryptos&lt;/i&gt;, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the &quot;real&quot; world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs &lt;i&gt;vast amounts of data of the right kind&lt;/i&gt;. Lets elaborate further on this point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7&quot; id=&quot;fnr.7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a &lt;i&gt;simulated world&lt;/i&gt; - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for &quot;immersive&quot; exploration. In fact, the &lt;i&gt;very processes for data generation&lt;/i&gt; will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, generated data is not perfect - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;realistic&lt;/i&gt; it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can &lt;i&gt;assume&lt;/i&gt; the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos &lt;i&gt;as if they were regular currencies&lt;/i&gt;, except where they are just &lt;i&gt;too different&lt;/i&gt; - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org92cf76f&quot;&gt;Non Goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orge684ba8&quot;&gt;Legalese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers. To make sure these are seen, we shall add them to each post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the content, including source code, is either written by the author of the posts, or obtained from freely available sites in the internet, with suitable software licences.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/word-clous-april-highlights-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-06916-z&quot;&gt;Are cancer patients better off if they participate in clinical trials? A mixed-methods study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11942 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Cancer-treatment-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Trial participation has not been found to provide better outcomes for cancer patients than standard care. With nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer&quot;&gt;one in six deaths estimated to be due to cancer&lt;/a&gt;, interest in innovative cancer research and treatment breakthroughs is high. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12937&quot;&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the information given to cancer trial participants and their physicians can be misleading, with information heavily focused on positive outcomes, with little information on the possible adverse effects or disadvantages of taking part. This can blur the boundaries between treatment and research, resulting in the belief that the best treatment for cancer provided within the context of a clinical trial. Through interviews and a systematic review of the literature, Nielsen &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. explored how physicians and nurses perceived the benefits of clinical trial participation and whether clinical trial participation provided better outcomes for cancer patients. Interviews revealed that there is a widespread belief amongst nurses and physicians that treatment for cancer, in the context of a clinical trial, is better than standard care. Many believed that recruiting patients to trials is a way to give them access to cutting-edge treatment. A search of the literature found no support for the belief that treatment in clinical trials is superior to standard care, despite rapid developments in cancer treatment in recent years. Lack of trial reporting transparency was also said to contribute to the belief that participating in trials is associated with better outcomes. Patient information sheets for cancer clinical trials should be designed to be free of suggestions that trial participation is the best treatment option for cancer patients. The focus should be shifted to encourage trial participation to further knowledge, to the potential benefit of future patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00013-4&quot;&gt;Comparing negative emissions and high renewable scenarios for the European power system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11945 alignright&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Renewable-Energy-300x194.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High renewable power system scenarios coupled with low levels of negative emissions technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, could deliver a net-negative European power system by 2050. Decarbonizing electricity generation is key to achieving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf&quot;&gt;Paris Climate Agreement&lt;/a&gt; for limiting average global temperature rise to ‘well below 2°C’ above pre-industrial levels. Gaffney &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; modeled emissions reduction, technical operation, and system costs for the year 2050. The analysis was designed to also include short time windows, to gain insights into the impact of high levels of variable renewable energy sources. It was demonstrated that high renewable power systems, coupled with negative emissions technologies, such as biomass carbon capture and storage, can deliver a net-negative European power system at lower costs, without breaching published sustainable biomass and geological storage potentials in Europe, with the opportunity to contribute to power system inertia. This study offers a first step in the comparison of future decarbonization scenarios and highlights concerns with system operation, economics, and emissions reduction, at a European scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Family Practice – &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-020-01122-z&quot;&gt;Safety, efficiency and health-related quality of telephone triage conducted by general practitioners, nurses, or physicians in out-of-hours primary care: a quasi-experimental study using the Assessment of Quality in Telephone Triage (AQTT) to assess audio-recorded telephone calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11946 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Nurse-Triage-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Nurses, using computerized decision support systems, performed better on a large number of health-related items than GPs, in telephone triage. Out-of-hours primary care services are increasing in a number of regions around the globe. Telephone triage is instrumental in the management of patient flow and workload. However, ensuring triage services are safe and efficient remains a challenge. Some countries, such as Denmark, use GPs to primarily perform triage services. However, this is hotly debated since many countries report increasing shortages of GPs, and GPs have self-reported high stress and burn-out symptoms. Graverson &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; studied a random sample of audio-recorded telephone triage calls from Danish out-of-hours primary care services triaged by GPs, nurses using computerized decision support systems, or physicians with different medical specialties. Nurses using computerized decision support systems performed better than GPs in telephone triage on a large number of health-related items, had lower levels of undertriage but were perceived less efficient. Nurse-led triage offers a solution for high GP workload seems feasible, but further research is needed since fewer GPs may be required for telephone triage services, but more GPs may be needed to meet out-of-hours service demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-020-05093-3&quot;&gt;Multiplex PCR for identification of two butterfly sister species: &lt;em&gt;Eurema mandarina&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eurema hecabe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11943 alignright&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Grass-Yellow-Butterfly-300x202.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;A multiplex PCR method has been found to accurately and reliably distinguish between closely related species of butterflies. In insects, closely related species are often difficult or impossible to distinguish solely by morphological traits alone. Existing techniques, such as using mitochondrial DNA markers, are not always available for species with complex genomic histories. Miyata &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; developed a multiplex PCR method to amplify and distinguish the sequences of  the triose phosphate isomerase (&lt;em&gt;Tpi&lt;/em&gt;) gene of two species of Japanese grass yellow butterflies (&lt;em&gt;Eurema mandarina&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eurema hecabe&lt;/em&gt;). The method designed was found to easily, reliably, and cost-effectively distinguish between two species of butterfly. The &lt;em&gt;Tpi&lt;/em&gt; gene sequences were found to be sufficiently variable to differentiate different species but invariable enough to allow designing primers within species. The &lt;em&gt;Tpi&lt;/em&gt; gene offers a potential target for marker development of multiplex PCR to distinguish other closely related butterfly species when other approaches are unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02364-w&quot;&gt;Pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects of intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy: a randomized, prospective, masked, clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11944 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Post-operative-veterinary-care-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Route of administration has been found to influence the analgesic efficiency of buprenorphine in dogs. Buprenorphine is used for postoperative pain management in cats and dogs, for example, in routine spays, known clinically as ovariohysterectomies. Previous studies have described the pharmacokinetics of the drug, however, the pharmacodynamics effect of this drug has not been consistently reported in these studies, which is important for understanding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drug in companion animals. Steagall &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; randomized dogs in a masked clinical trial to either receive buprenorphine intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously before ovariohysterectomy and pain was scored with the Glasgow composite pain scale for dogs. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out on the dog’s blood samples. Subcutaneous administration of buprenorphine failed to provide sufficient analgesia due to erratic drug absorption. Dogs in this group received the highest amount of rescue pain relief compared to dogs that received buprenorphine intravenously or intramuscularly. At the doses administered, intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration are preferred for postoperative buprenorphine analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/pumpkin-1768857_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine digging into a bowl of strawberries. They are in season and make for a delicious, healthy snack. The deep red color and the aroma of the sliced berries are striking. That’s pelargonidin 3-glucoside (&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;) and methoxyfuraneol (&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;) captivating the senses. There’s gamma-decalactone (&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;) in those berries too. In fact, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://edu.rsc.org/feature/what39s-in-your-strawberries/2020275.article&quot;&gt;hundreds of other biochemical compounds&lt;/a&gt; naturally present in this fruit. The situation is no different for other foods like turmeric, ginger, garlic, romaine lettuce, chocolate, coffee, and even wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11951&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11951 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/fig1-1-300x188.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: www.ars.usda.gov/oc/images/photos/aug08/d1194-1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some compounds found in strawberries include pelargonidin 3-glucoside (1, PubChem ID &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/443648&quot;&gt;443648&lt;/a&gt;), methoxyfuraneol (2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/53929577&quot;&gt;53929577&lt;/a&gt;) and gamma-decalactone (3, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12813&quot;&gt;12813&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what health effects can these compounds produce? The answers are many, of course, because the catalog of compounds in any one food is long and diverse, and testing every compound experimentally is prohibitive. However, some answers can arise from putting rigorous computational methods to the task of exploring nutrition’s “dark matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dark matter in nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In metabolomics, this “dark matter” is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/112/41/12549.long&quot;&gt;the massive amount&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00179&quot;&gt;spectral data&lt;/a&gt; that cannot be assigned easily to known molecules. As relating to nutrition, this notion of dark matter recently has been explored in two ways. First, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/usda-nutrient-data-laboratory&quot;&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/bax044/3867710&quot;&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/&quot;&gt;catalogs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-019-0005-1&quot;&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; present in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814619314001&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;, fermented, processed, stored, and metabolized food. With this foundation, the second exploratory step is naturally to identify the biological functions of each compound. To make progress in step two, we elected to use the well-characterized universe of pharmaceutical compounds as an anchor to predictions about food compounds. Specifically, we asked the question: “Can we predict biological function of a compound by identifying structurally similar pharmacological agents?” And so, the design and coding of PhyteByte began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What PhyteByte does&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds. The implementation is simple: the end-user inputs a protein target, and PhyteByte identifies food compounds with a relatively high likelihood of interacting with the target, thus predicting biological effects. PhyteByte leverages a random forest classifier to perform much of the heavy lifting. This model is trained to identify pharmaceutical compounds from databases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/&quot;&gt;ChEMBL&lt;/a&gt;. Compounds are &lt;a href=&quot;http://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Features/Fingerprints.html&quot;&gt;encoded&lt;/a&gt; as “fingerprints” – simple bit vectors that store complex cheminformatics sub-structure information. Our model learns the sub-structures that it is looking for – for a given target – and generalizes this to identify novel food compounds in our test dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, PhyteByte is a prediction tool. Its output is a list of molecules and their source foods that are very likely to have specific biological effects, but it is not a tool to devise a meal plan or provide for dietary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road ahead for computational nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhyteByte is just one of numerous examples of new computational methods – like complex systems theory and machine learning – being layered atop genomics, metabolomics, and genetics data in nutrition research. In fact, one can make the point that computational nutrition is merely the natural offspring of the nutrition-omics marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational nutrition likely will develop in several ways. One, given a phenotype or protein of interest, foods are proposed that may affect that phenotype or protein, and done in a targeted, macronutrient-free manner. Two, more detailed epidemiological and food frequency questionnaire data can support tests for connections between certain foods and health outcomes. Here, the foods under study contain compounds that potentially offer narrowly defined health benefits based on similarity to known drugs. Three, such computationally derived pharmacological-food compound links can inform drug development. For example, drug efficacy studies could instruct volunteers to avoid specific foods that contain compounds potentially exhibiting physiological effects like the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, while some of the above scientific endeavors have been woven into nutrition research for some time, all of what is described here requires that efforts be put forth at a much grander scale. And, for such approaches to be most effective, there must occur a concerted, broad effort to identify and accurately quantify the roughly 2000 different compounds in each food, a theme central to the emerging foodomics field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

I especially am investing my time in different ways and am working mostly at home. Working from home would have been severely prohibitive for me just a few weeks ago, due to lack of access to adequate internet connectivity in the rural area where I live. However, our local electric cooperative now provides fiber optic internet that my family and I are using to our full advantage, as we engage in professional &amp;amp; school work—and the business of family life—simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research aspects of my work suddenly became secondary to teaching responsibilities. All of my teaching switched abruptly from quality in-person experiences honed over years, to hastily contrived online substitutes cobbled together in a panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research aspects of my work suddenly became secondary to teaching responsibilities. All of my teaching switched abruptly from quality in-person experiences honed over years, to hastily contrived online substitutes cobbled together in a panic. The biggest challenge was delivery of emergency substitutes for field and laboratory coursework. Thus, I have been creating, documenting and demonstrating activities from home. This has meant &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; breeding experiments on the dining room table, seedlings in a window sill, and turning a corner of the garage into a video production set to capture animal behavior. During my unpaid summer, I will be investing significant time and effort in professional development opportunities that I hope will help me do a better job of continued, emergency, remote instruction that will be necessary in the coming academic year. In some instances, redundant planning for in-person, remote and hybrid instructional modes must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to recent departures of employees and hiring freezes, I do not have the assistance of a laboratory technician or collections manager, who normally would support my teaching and research, which means I am doing that work myself, on top of usual and additional responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My access to campus facilities is limited to once per week, and this is a special privilege so that I may care for the physical laboratory resources. Almost all research work on my campus has been discontinued or put on hold. The vast majority of students are prohibited from entering campus buildings, and their research in my lab has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://bmcserieseditors.biomedcentral.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=45/https://images.zapnito.com/uploads/9a4dfe9fafe44c3d29b43d7006b83255/48a2b8a3-f141-48f9-b8b0-45edb3e362c1.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research activity normally involves field work and use of specimens from institutional collections. These collections are closed, and I cannot visit them. Specimens borrowed from collections are not being used, and they have been boxed up and fill the lab benches normally occupied by students (see figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to certain travel restrictions, my field work has been delayed, and I was fortunate to obtain one-year extensions from grant agencies for time-sensitive aspects of these studies. However, an ongoing project at a local wildlife refuge will have at least a one-year gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research collaborators around the globe are facing similar, if not more extreme, restrictions and challenges, not the least of which is lack of internet access. The majority of my collaborations are on hold or progressing extremely slowly. Professional meetings have been canceled or indefinitely postponed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate students have had to halt or delay projects. My undergraduate research students have had a variety of on-the-fly substitute projects to complete from home. In some cases, depth and breadth of study have been sacrificed so students could complete alternatives to fulfill degree requirements on time. Looking ahead, I am concerned about multiple cohorts of developing researchers worldwide who will have critical gaps in their experience and knowledge bases, due to the limitations we face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabbatical leaves for research, including my own, have been delayed or are in question. Faculty promotion clocks have been altered and complicated. Submission of my own dossier likely will be delayed by at least one year. Our campus anticipates increased faculty teaching loads to help off-set financial impacts. We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, I’ve been able to make more rapid and substantial progress than expected on biodiversity data transcription, editing and management. Public access to important data from historical collections and literature will be available in greater quantity and sooner than expected. I may also be able to complete and submit some manuscripts that had been delayed due to now moot priorities. As an editor, I am beginning to see others have had the same opportunities. Clearly, Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on research progress and prospects for years to come, in ways we recognize and in ways we have yet to anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: “Listening to my baby before birth”:  training mothers in labor to detect fetal heart rate changes to help address the gap in midwifery care in low-resource settings</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/feature2-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Listening to my baby heart sound was very helpful to me. I felt that my right was respected as I took in my baby monitoring. Thanks for this program. I am happy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of a young Liberian mother who, as part of an innovation to improve neonatal and maternal health, was listening to the heart beat of her own fetus at the end of every contraction during her labor, using a simple handheld sonicaid ultrasound device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this approach needed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a low-resource country such as Liberia, where there are few midwives — according to the WHO and World Bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.NUMW.P3&quot;&gt;only 1 midwife or nurse per 10,000 population&lt;/a&gt;, the second lowest number in the world after Somalia — midwives are often too overworked and overstretched to monitor the fetal heart rate regularly in every woman in labor, even though doing this essential task is necessary to detect fetal distress that could lead to negative outcomes. As a result, changes in the fetal heart rate that could indicate problems are often missed, leading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/newborn-care/&quot;&gt;high rates of birth asphyxia&lt;/a&gt; in newborn infants in such settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training more midwives is a long-term but absolutely crucial strategy. As shown in the recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications-detail/nursing-report-2020&quot;&gt;State of the World’s Nursing Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;, investment in nurses and midwives is vital to delivering Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an immediate option is to train mothers in labor to listen to their fetal heart rate at the end of every contraction and notify the attending midwife if they detect any changes. If confirmed, suggesting fetal distress, the midwife would then notify a senior clinician who would undertake an immediate clinical intervention to protect the fetus from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feasibility study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11905 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/Picture1-226x300.png&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot; width=&quot;226&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step of such a bold and unusual potential approach is to find out if mothers are willing to monitor their own fetus during labor, and if so, if they are able to detect any changes. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphatically shows that it is not only feasible for Liberian mothers, many of whom cannot read or write, to monitor their own fetus during labor and accurately detect changes, but that the majority found the experience positive and beneficial for their own wellbeing and that of their babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments from participating mothers are poignant and moving and, if you have time, the authors encourage you to read the full set of comments in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z#Sec28&quot;&gt;additional files&lt;/a&gt; linked to our paper&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The vast majority of participating mothers (387 out of the 400 mothers who provided comments) found the experience positive. Many commented on how much they enjoyed listening to their baby’s heart beat or hearing their baby “breathing” inside them, and that it gave them hope that their baby was alive. Several commented that hearing their baby’s heart beat gave them strength and courage to carry on while they were experiencing labor pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many women commented on the negative effects of the severe pain of labor and as a result, MCAI and the Ministry of Health have recently started an initiative to administer IV paracetamol, an analgesic which is appropriate to the Liberian setting, to mothers who are requesting pain relief during labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another encouraging finding was that of the 26 of 461 participating mothers for whom changes in the fetal heart rate were identified, the mothers detected these changes in 24 of these cases. Identification of these changes led to swift clinical intervention and ultimately resulted in all 26 babies, some of whom had needed further management in the neonatal unit, surviving and being discharged home healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding also showed that maternal monitoring in itself is not enough as there also needed to be appropriate clinical interventions to manage any detected changes in the fetal heart rate. So in addition to maternal fetal monitoring, there also need to be in place robust clinical protocols, a skilled workforce, and appropriately equipped and supplied facilities to be able to appropriately manage any changes in fetal heart rate and deliver the Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care required to save lives and improve the quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal fetal monitoring has continued in the two public hospitals that were involved in the feasibility study and, as a result of these positive findings and experiences, the Liberian Ministry of Health has agreed to expand maternal fetal monitoring to three more hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion of task sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative solutions to help overcome human-resource scarcities in low-income settings are not new. For example, because of the severe lack of doctors, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://12dec1c3-e3f4-e784-7f3a-6e7903610962.filesusr.com/ugd/dd2ba4_40c5e3dabfc44420af2dc6de29201de2.pdf&quot;&gt;established Liberian task-sharing program&lt;/a&gt; involves training midwives in advanced obstetric care and training nurses in advanced neonatal care in order to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths and improve the quality of care. Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves. As a young mother recently commented during the continuation of the maternal fetal monitoring program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I tell the midwife thanks for the care that was given to me. It empower me to listen to my own baby heart beat and I hope that other women will do the same.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144301</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence supports my clinical experience that younger people, high schoolers especially, are having more psychological problems during the pandemic than adults. There are many reasons for this. Adolescents are in the developmental stage of forming a new social world away from their parents. Social needs tend to dominate their lives and yet currently this growth has come to a bit of a standstill. In addition, teenagers are not fully cognitively developed; their moods still dominate compared to the planning and attention that are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, which doesn’t fully develop until about age 25. We all need to create a new and different worldview, but adults have more history and neurological development to take the long view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can help support our teens in many ways. Here are some recommendations for how to communicate and foster mental health during this difficult time; many of them will benefit the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Remember that no matter how much teens might protest, they are still dependent on their parents; the family is still the go-to support system. We need to show our teens that they can still count on us; that are we are emotionally there for them. I don’t mean a rose-colored glasses approach, but a realistic and strong view. Listen rather than trying to solve problems and try to check in often. It may be painful to hear teens’ worries because in the current situation, we are all struggling with a variety of anxieties. Communicate that although this is an extremely challenging situation, we can get through it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicate what you know as well as uncertainty. We’re are all under enormous stress. Our children can see it in us. Rather than try to avoid the sadness, it is better to communicate what you can. For example, if you know that if you get sick a relative or family friend is ready to step in, that will reassure your teens. On the other hand, if your teen wants to know when they will be able to go out in groups, you can reply that you don’t know but are monitoring the guidelines. Clarify that all this hardship is about keeping us as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember coping skills and resilience. Although teens are still developing psychologically, they may be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. Under this enormous stress, however, they may overlook how they have coped during hard times in the past. You can remind them how, for example, when there was illness in the family, they read certain types of books, baked, or wrote in a journal. Many of us, in the hopes of protecting our children from pain, do not help them learn distress tolerance. Even though we are in the midst of a worldwide trauma, building on a teen’s existing strengths can help increase distress tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Most of us are struggling with some level of anxiety or sadness. This is a natural response to a surreal situation. Clinical anxiety or depression is something different. If you observe panic attacks, extreme worry, or avoidance, those are some symptoms of an anxiety disorder.  Similarly, some symptoms of a major depressive episode include feeling sad or empty, feeling hopeless, experiencing changes in appetite or sleep, expressing guilt, and having suicidal thoughts. Remember, too, that in adolescents, irritability may be a more prominent symptom than sadness. Even now, you can contact your pediatrician for a referral to a mental health professional.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Getting in touch with a previous psychotherapist or psychiatrist can be in enormously helpful, even if just for a “check in.” Most psychotherapists are now comfortable using teleconferencing or telephone sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to take care of yourself. It is an axiom in mental health that if a parent is feeling psychologically healthy, so will a child.  This is an upsetting time and parenting is one of life’s most challenging (also rewarding) experiences. Try to include some time for yourself for restoration, fun or a conversation with a close friend. Reach out to family, friends, or close co-workers for specific assistance. Some of the tips suggested may not be easy or even possible for you given your economic or social situation. You may be a single parent. You may be a member of a minority group or frontline healthcare professional. If so family, religious groups, neighborhood networks, or community agencies can also provide the support that you need. Please don’t hesitate to get help; we can get through this if we all work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-consoling-her-sad-daughter_2826738.htm#page=1&amp;amp;query=family%20help&amp;amp;position=12&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by rawpixel.com via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/&quot;&gt;The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/627428622/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/627428622/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/six-books-to-help-us-understand-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Six books to help us understand eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-to-experience-pandemic-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we experience pandemic time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;A call to celebrate with reflection in the absence of convocation.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fK-Q38qYGjFLA9jd4yWJdA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just graduated with a degree in Neuroscience without a plan to go to med school or grad school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then what do you want to do with that?” People would always ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Learn about the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my answer every time. To me, a degree was always a gem of knowledge before it was a stepping stone. I hope my fellow graduating class of 2020 feel that way about their degrees too — we need to, now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With jobs and internships blasted to smithereens, convocations cancelled, and glamorous grad trips put on hold, graduation must take on a new meaning. It must be a reflection on the gems of knowledge we gained from our degrees: the lessons learned that will forever change the way we look at, live in, and leave the world. Here are 5 lessons I learned from my Neuroscience degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 1 — Let Your Parents Take Pictures: Episodic Memory is the First to Go&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*r1DUFAbUtjw2XJVU&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to get annoyed when my mom wanted to take a selfie with us. I don’t any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why now?” we’d all ask as she whipped out her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To remember this!” she’d say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I studied aging and memory, I began to realize how good of a reason that really was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, most of us can achieve “healthy aging” by learning new skills, being creative, and thinking and working in different ways. We can sail into the sunset of life with relative sharpness of mind, and even memory. For example, we won’t forget how to drive a car or brush our teeth because our procedural, or “muscle”, memory remains in good shape. Semantic memory — memory for facts — doesn’t suffer much either, and can even get better as we age (think about your last game of trivia with mom and dad). One type of memory, however, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; immune to aging: episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory, or memory for personal experiences, is shown to decline in accuracy as we get older. So, while my mom may be able to mince garlic, drive to Costco, and name the singer of &lt;em&gt;Suspicious Minds&lt;/em&gt; with ease, she may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; always remember what she ordered on the second time we went to that Ramen place in Palo Alto, and who was there. But a cue, like a picture, can be the magic wand for recalling the night a few siblings and I slurped away with her just down the street from Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1. &lt;/strong&gt;Be patient with your parents when they can’t remember the little things, and support their requested selfies so they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 2 — Play Cards With Everyone : Remembering What Makes Us, Us&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HdBCRkRupUHybzqH&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were observing the beginning of a card game, you wouldn’t judge the players by their starting hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been dealt a hand of cards. This hand isn’t chosen and doesn’t change. This hand is unique to us and has certain strengths and weaknesses. This hand is our genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between genes and behavior has changed the way I interact with others. Looking back at the times I discriminated against people because of their behavior, I could very well have been doing so because of their genes. I have been guilty of judging card players by their starting hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why is she overreacting?” I’d ask. “I wish he wasn’t so impulsive,” I’d think. I later learned in &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; that slow stress recovery and impulsivity are sometimes results of specific gene variants — a specific card in one’s hand. I learned that one fourth of the population holds the slow-acting variant of COMT, which is an enzyme that aids in stress recovery. It turned out all the “over-reactors” I was so quick to label were just working with a unique card in their hand. Then I learned that a certain variant of the DRD4 gene, held by around 20% of the population, is implicated in addiction, impulsivity, higher risk-taking and even schizophrenia. Come to think about it, all those people I thought were “impulsive adrenaline junkies” had been dealt a joker at the beginning of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other behaviors can hardly be traced back to a single gene, but follow the “common variant” model. Autism follows this model, wherein a certain “recipe” of common gene variants may be the culprit. Individuals with autism might have a 5 of diamonds, an 8 of spades, and a jack of hearts — common cards all of us hold. But that specific combination may be just the one to produce the set of behaviors we’ve come to define as “autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I never dared call an autistic person weird, I was no stranger to passing that judgment on “normal” people I found socially clumsy. Understanding the neurobiology of autism (or lack thereof) called for a shift in paradigm: “autism” is a set of traits, just like any other set of traits produced by any given hand of common cards. If every single person could have their genotype mapped and behavior closely observed, we would find more correlations between certain behavior sets and gene variant combinations. Then everyone would have a “disorder.” So if today I run into someone I’m tempted to call weird, annoying, or anything else, I can remember that these traits are the results of unique card combinations, a lot like the ones in my own hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you’d might as well rescind my degree if I were claiming we were all puppets of our DNA. If there is any certainty in neuroscience, it’s that our brains are plastic: we can change the way experiences and genes have programmed us to think and behave (more on that in Lesson #4). A DRD4 holder can learn to tame his impulsivity. Someone with the slower COMT variant can work to reframe her stressors. And those who behave a little differently in social situations can find confidence and connection in society. Nevertheless, everyone has to start — and end — with the genes they’ve been dealt, and only time, experience, and patience can help us fulfill the potential therein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2. &lt;/strong&gt;Never judge a player by their starting hand and play fairly with everyone — we’re all learning to play our cards right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 3 — The Best Way to Do Dishes : Letting Dish Soap Do Its Job.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-45BSqN1OpsgRB0_&quot; /&gt;Photo by Odua Images&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you had to learn how to wash dishes all over again, but this time only through observation. You’d soon find there are different styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may enjoy the efficiency of the filler-uppers, who turn their sink into a soapy swimming hole for the evening. The brute-forcers might excite you as they pour soap straight onto the dish and scrub frantically under a running faucet. But understanding the chemistry may call you down a different path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soap cleans dishes — I didn’t need a chemistry class to tell me that. What I &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;need it to tell me was &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;. Water — a polar molecule — and grease — a nonpolar molecule — don’t mix. This is where dish soap comes in. Soap is an amphipathic molecule: it’s both polar and nonpolar. It can grab the grease and hold on with its nonpolar tail as its polar head follows water down the drain. Understanding this, we can see how soap can’t possibly do its thing when violently swished around in a pool or under a waterfall. It needs to do its job in steps: 1) bind to the grease, 2) get washed down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3: &lt;/strong&gt;The best way to wash dishes is a quick rinse to remove the leftover food scraps followed by a soapy scrub sans water, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; a thorough rinse under the faucet. “Wash, rinse, repeat,” simple. But for me, it’s now a simplicity that isn’t blind. For me, the magic of dish soap is, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, a “simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 4 — Why “It’s Not Good For Man to Be Alone”: On Potentiation and Proximity.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MRxZRyxVChxx8JTN&quot; /&gt;Photo by ZoomSpectrum&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Marketing degrees are useless.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“He’s just following the crowd.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“She’s just doing that because…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Musical Dance Theatre majors are wasting their time.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left alone, I would think thoughts like these. Left alone for longer, I would start to believe them. This is the dark side of potentiation, or how thoughts become “ingrained” in our brains. Understanding potentiation helped me break unhealthy trains of thought, and build healthier ones. To understand potentiation, however, you’ll need a crash course in neuroanatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rake is a great model for a neuron. The teeth of the rake represent the dendrites, the receiving end of a neuron. These dendrite “teeth” converge onto the head of the rake, which represents the cell body, a control center that processes input from the dendrites. From the head protrudes the long rake handle representing the axon, or “giving” end of the neuron. If the cell body “decides” to send a message to the next cell, it shoots an electrical impulse — an action potential — down the axon. The axon then communicates to the dendrite of the next cell. If you string a bunch of rakes together end-to-end, with the handle of one rake feeding into one of the teeth of the next, you have a neural pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I thought, “marketing degrees are useless,” an entire neural pathway fired. Zooming into the connections, or synapses, between neurons in the pathway, we can begin to understand how our thoughts become potentiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the first neuron in the pathway: when an action potential shot down its axon and reached the end, it released chemicals — neurotransmitters — that travelled across the synapse toward the dendrite of the second neuron. When the dendrite received the neurotransmitter, it sent input to its cell body, much like one of the skinny teeth of a rake feeds into the head. As I kept thinking, “marketing degrees are useless,” the cell body continued to receive input from this dendrite and charge began to build up. When the amount of charge reached a threshold, the cell body shot an action potential down its axon to communicate to the next cell, but this had repercussions. An action potential did not only shoot &lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt;, down the axon rake handle, but also &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt;, throughout the dendrite teeth in the form of a &lt;em&gt;backpropagating &lt;/em&gt;action potential&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So long as I kept thinking “marketing degrees are useless” without interruption, one of these teeth was still busy receiving input from the first neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the action potential of the first neuron met the &lt;em&gt;backpropagating&lt;/em&gt; action potential of the second at their synapse, potentiation ensued: the connection between the first and second neuron was strengthened. The first now released neurotransmitter with every thought, the second neuron was more sensitive to that neurotransmitter, and as a result, it became a lot easier for me to think that marketing degrees were useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until of course, I talked to a marketing student, and learned a new idea that would prove valuable at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought my neighbor was just following the crowd until I talked to him on the way to church and learned his genuine motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sure why my friend was acting irritated until she told me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was so convinced that Musical Dance Theatre majors were wasting their time until I interviewed one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, Musical Dance Theatre majors spend multiple days understanding the inner world of character they dance, sing, and act on behalf of. They do what I hadn’t done: get &lt;em&gt;proximate&lt;/em&gt; to those who so desperately need their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students of the Bible agree that when the Creator stated, “It’s not good for man to be alone,” he was hinting at a partner. But there’s another reason it’s not good for man to be alone: Partners and everyone else were meant to be loved, and when we are left alone to think about them, our thinking is flawed. When we are left alone for longer, we begin to believe ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 4:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not good for man to be alone because thoughts potentiate, so get proximate to others. Proximity will shatter your belief about someone and give you a chance to build something beautiful in its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 5 — Mercy Softens, Trust Ennobles.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kIJcLvJTv0cgXpaH&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into my last semester, I made a realization. In response to it, I wrote the following email to my professor and meant it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Dr. ______,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I made a mistake: &lt;/strong&gt;I did not check the exam availability days. I assumed it ran for 4 days and thought I could still take it today. May I still take the exam, not for credit, but just as a benchmark for myself? I know you don’t allow exams to be taken home, so I can take it during a TA office hour or one of yours? Let me know what you advise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;thank you,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Isaac Wu&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning of the exam, I was upset. My roommates had done something I couldn’t let go of. As I walked with my professor of &lt;em&gt;Advanced Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; to the empty computer lab, my mind hardened with grudges. As we neared the entrance, he spoke up and told me the test I was about to take was actually going to be for credit and that there were no penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every thought was silenced — something had changed inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the muscles in my face relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I let go of the roommate thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was softened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was letting me off the hook when he had every reason not to, and it stopped me cold. At that point, the points were immaterial: My accumulated GPA was high and essentially set in stone and I’d already had a job lined up. Nevertheless, his mercy had softened me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was getting my things settled when he spoke up again, saying that he needed to go teach another class, and I should slide my test under his door when I was finished. He then said, “I know there are so many ways you can cheat, and I know you won’t use them. Do great.” He slipped out the door and I was alone in the large computer lab. I completed my midterm in silence, with a pencil and nothing else. I did my absolute best — his trust had ennobled me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my phone and took the above picture. I wanted to remember this moment forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t need the picture. I would continue to put forth incredible effort in that class to learn everything I possibly could, to perform as well as I could, and to do it all with the utmost honesty. A few months later, I only needed a fifteen out of one hundred on my quarantined, un-proctored final to pass the class. With the COVID-converted grading system, anything above a C would be a “Pass” that wouldn’t affect my GPA. Still, I studied as if every future neurosurgery patient or grad school application depended on it, though I knew I’d never have either of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t have to let me take the test for credit but he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could’ve gotten someone to proctor but he didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 5: &lt;/strong&gt;Mercy softens, trust ennobles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Congrats, Grad.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These gems won’t lose their shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are more selfies to be taken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…more card games to be played,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…more house chores to be enriched by a scientific lens,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…proximities to be enjoyed,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…mercy and trust to be given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are all graduating with something:&lt;/strong&gt; a Neuroscience Degree at BYU, a marketing degree somewhere else (and a useful one at that!), more time at home with family. Whatever we emerge with during this world-wide pandemic is a graduation, a step toward a life more insightful and moral. Write down the lessons learned — these are the things worth celebrating. Congrats, Grad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Fellow Graduate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=3e35a9461a7d&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/5-lessons-i-learned-from-my-neuroscience-degree-3e35a9461a7d&quot;&gt;5 Lessons I Learned From My Neuroscience Degree&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: What are women’s experiences of decision-making and choice about their pregnancy and birth care?</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/11/what-are-womens-experiences-of-decision-making-and-choice-about-their-pregnancy-and-birth-care/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-613687218-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Choice’ has increasingly become a fundamental aspect of Western public health policy and practice since the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. For maternity care, it is a buzzword that has generated a growing body of research around how to best support decision-making and achieve informed choice among women. However, promoting more service user autonomy and care experiences that are aligned with personal values can lead to complex trade-offs, as choices are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-143-4-200508160-00010&quot;&gt;based&lt;/a&gt; on more sophisticated, expanding services with less reliance on a clinician’s intuitive judgment. While sometimes maternity care professionals believe they are offering choice, in reality, women still have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/324/7338/639&quot;&gt;limited role&lt;/a&gt; in decision-making and do not feel their care is presented as a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is choice really so complex?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear about the ‘burden’ of choice, and how difficult it can be to make one in complex situations or when there are many options before us. Long-standing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10350446/&quot;&gt;understandings&lt;/a&gt; of decision-making and choice often assume that the decider uses a rational process to weigh up and decide between all available options. This idea of a ‘rational’ decision-making process is connected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1955-01791-001&quot;&gt;classical decision theory&lt;/a&gt;, a concept developed during the 1950s. However, in reality, humans rarely make choices according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-10203-004&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; of classical decision theory, even though the quality of their decision-making is judged based on the prescripts of this long-standing theory, despite its inadequacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-012-2077-6&quot;&gt;Shared decision-making&lt;/a&gt;’ is a collaborative approach where clinicians support service users to reach a decision about their care. While shared-decision-making principles have been well-established, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/ktt23/chapter/Evidence-context&quot;&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; to implementing them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding decision-making and choice through research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding decision-making and choice assumptions is important because there is growing evidence of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7400&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early&quot;&gt;different options&lt;/a&gt; for maternity care in Western settings, as well as the notion of reproductive choice as a human right. As research studies increasingly collate evidence concerning the clinical outcomes of different care options, it should follow that we also bring together the findings about women’s experiences of choosing these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing a breadth of research all together can be helpful for elucidating complex phenomena, especially those that carry assumptions about what is optimal and what is not. Reviews also help researchers evaluate the quality of studies conducted on a specific area and determine whether there are any gaps in the literature.  The aim of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03023-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;was to describe and interpret qualitative research on women’s experiences of decision-making and choice about their pregnancy and birth care. Given the prominence of choice in health policy, we wanted to shed light on how this has been addressed in research to date and what the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings and conceptual model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reviewed 37 original studies and conducted a meta-synthesis of these studies’ findings. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-8-45&quot;&gt;meta-synthesis&lt;/a&gt; involves bringing all of the qualitative data from a review together and re-analyzing it, in order to discover essential features across the body of literature. Because decision-making and choice are complex phenomena, we developed a conceptual model based on our analysis to bring all of these features together into one, presented in Figure 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11938&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11938&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/figure-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1, from Yuill, et al. 2020&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model takes into account the three essential themes that emerged from the meta-synthesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Uncertainty’&lt;/em&gt; encompasses several different experiences that are related to mothers’ concerns about the unknown and the course of pregnancy, childbirth and maternity care, all of which shape women’s decision-making and the options they ultimately pursue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women frequently discuss their maternity experiences in terms of control, whether it be losing it, maintaining it or reclaiming it. We chose to shift the perspective to &lt;em&gt;‘Bodily autonomy and integrity’&lt;/em&gt; because ‘control’ is not always explicitly stated by participants, and experiences often refer back to the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Performing good motherhood’&lt;/em&gt; is related to responsibility and risk, which are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698575.2013.859231&quot;&gt;ascribed&lt;/a&gt; to mothers to manage, as well as the gendered cultural norm that ‘good’ motherhood and birth takes place in a hospital with a team of medical professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also recognizes that decision-making is an active process, so these themes are connected through three inter-linking actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Information gathering’&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the multiplicity of information-seeking and what women specifically gain from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Balancing aspects of a choice’&lt;/em&gt; is concerned with looking at how women consider the different options available to them and, essentially, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of those they encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of decision-making, an important part of the process is &lt;em&gt;‘Aligning with a birth philosophy’&lt;/em&gt;, or perspectives that inform the ways in which people understand the world and life in it, further shaping the information women access, the care opinions they ultimately choose and the ways they justify their choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important finding from our review is that decision-making and choice are temporal, or related to time. For pregnancy and birth, they are made within a defined period, and often invoke both the past, whether this is personal, familial, social or historical, and the future. Finally, our discussion highlighted the importance of embodiment in maternal health experiences and how this is connected to experiences of decision-making and choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process that is not always straightforward. This means that the use of prescriptive and rigid theoretical frameworks, like classical decision theory, for decision-making and choice need to be rethought. Policymakers and practitioners alike should examine critically current choice frameworks to ascertain whether they truly allow for flexibility in decision-making. Health systems should embrace more fluid, personalized models of care, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early&quot;&gt;midwife-led continuity models of care&lt;/a&gt;, to augment service users’ decision-making agency.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bits of DNA: Black lives matter</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, June 10th 2020, black academic scientists are holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shutdownstem.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a strike in solidarity with Black Lives Matter protests&lt;/a&gt;. I strike with them and for them. This is why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to understand the enormity of racism against blacks thirty five years ago when I was 12 years old. A single event, in which I witnessed a black man pleading for his life, opened my eyes. I don’t remember his face but I do remember looking at his dilapidated brown pants and noticing his hands shaking around the outside of his pockets while he plead for mercy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please baas, please baas, … ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 1985, and I was visiting my friend Tamir Orbach at his house in &lt;del&gt;Pretoria&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Tshwane_Metropolitan_Municipality&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tshwane&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa, located in Muckleneuk hill. We were playing in the courtyard next to Tamir’s garage, which was adjacent to a retaining wall and a wide gate. Google Satellite now enables virtual visits to anywhere in the world, and it took me seconds to find the house. The courtyard and retaining wall look the same. The gate we were playing in front of has changed color from white to black:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house was located at the bottom of a short cul de sac on the slope of a hill. It’s difficult to see from the aerial photo, but in the street view, looking down, the steep driveway is visible. The driveway stones are the same as they were the last time I was at the house in the 1980s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard some commotion at the top of the driveway. I don’t remember what we were doing at that moment, but I do remember seeing a man sprinting down the hill towards us. I remember being afraid of him. I was afraid of black men. A police officer was chasing him, gun in hand, shouting at the top of his lungs. The man ran into the neighboring property, scaled a wall to leap onto a roof, only to realize he may be trapped. He jumped back onto the driveway, dodged the cop, and and ran back up the hill. I remember thinking that I had never seen a man run so fast. The policeman, by now out of breath but still behind the man, chased close behind with his gun swinging around wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a second police officer, who was now visible standing at the top of the driveway, feet apart, and pointing a gun down at the man. We were in the line of fire, albeit quite far away behind the gate. The sprint ended abruptly when the man realized he had, in fact, been trapped. Tamir and I had been standing, frozen in place, watching the events unfold in front of us. Meanwhile the screaming had drawn one of our parents out of the house, concerned about the commotion and asking us what was going on. We walked, together, up the driveway to the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was being arrested next to a yellow police pickup truck, a staple of South African police at the time and an emblem of police brutality. The police pickup trucks had what was essentially a small jail cell mounted on the flat bed, and they were literal pick up trucks; their purpose was to pick up blacks off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs were barking loudly in the back of the pickup truck and the man was sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please baas, not the dogs. Not the dogs. Please baas. Please baas…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police were yelling at the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your passbook no good!! No pass!! Your passbook!! You’re going in with the dogs and coming with us!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please… please… ” the man begged. I remember him crying. He was terrified of the dogs. They had started barking so loudly and aggressively that the vehicle was shaking. The man kept repeating “Please… not with the dogs… please… they will kill me. Please… help me. Please… the dogs will kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was pleading for his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passbook the police were yelling about was a sort of domestic or internal passport all black people over the age of 16 were required to carry at all times in white areas. South Africa, in 1985, was a country that was racially divided. Some cities were for whites only. Some only for blacks. “Coloureds”, who were defined as individuals of mixed ancestry, were restricted to cities of their own. In his book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Born a Crime&lt;/a&gt;“, Trevor Noah describes how these anti-miscegenation laws resulted in it being impossible for him to legally live with his mother when he was a child. Note that Mississippi removed anti-miscegenation laws from its state constitution only in 1987 and Alabama in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South African passbook requirement stemmed from a law passed in 1952, with origins dating back to British policies from the 18th century. The law had the following stipulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No black person could stay in a white urban area for more than 72 hours unless explicit permission was granted by an employer (required to be white).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passbook contained behavioral evaluations from employers. Permission to enter an area could be revoked by any government employee for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the live-in maids (as they were called) in Pretoria had passbooks permitting them to live (usually in an outhouse) on the property of their “employer”. I put “employer” in quotes because at best they would earn $250 a month (in todays $ adjusted for inflation) would sleep in a small shack outside of a large home, and receive a small budget for food which would barely cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mielie-meal&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;millie pap&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases they lived in outhouses without running water, were abused, beaten and raped. Live-in-maids spent months at a time apart from their children and families- they couldn’t leave their jobs for fear of being fired and/or losing their pass permission. Their families couldn’t visit them as they did not have permission, by pass laws, to enter the white areas in which the live-in-maids worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most males had passbooks allowing them only day trips into the city from the black townships in which they lived. Many lived in Mamelodi, a township 15 miles east of Tswhane, and would travel hours to and from work because they were not allowed on white public transport. I lived in Pretoria for 13 years and I never saw Mamelodi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have heard about passbooks before the incident at Tamir’s house, but I didn’t know what they were or how they worked. Learning about pass laws was not part of our social studies or history curriculum. At my high school, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria_Boys_High_School&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pretoria Boys High School&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Milner,_1st_Viscount_Milner&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Milner school&lt;/a&gt; which counts among its alumni individuals such as dilettante &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and murderer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oscar Pistorius&lt;/a&gt;, we learned about the history of South Africa’s white architects, people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cecil Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; (may his name and his memory be erased). There was one black boy in the school when I was there (out of about 1,200 students). He was allowed to attend because he was the son of an ambassador, as if somehow that mitigated his blackness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa started abandoning its pass laws in 1986, just a few months after the incident I described above. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Suzman&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Helen Suzman&lt;/a&gt; described it at the time as possibly one of the most eminent government reforms ever enacted. Still, although this was a small step towards dismantling apartheid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; was still in jail, in Pollsmoor Prison at that time, and he remained imprisoned for 3 more years until he was released from captivity after 27 years in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not stand by idly while the man was being arrested. We asked the police to let him go, or at least to not throw him in with the dogs, but the cops ignored us and dragged the man towards the back of the van. The phrase “kicking and screaming” is bantered about a lot; there is even a sports comedy with that title. That day I saw a man literally kicking and screaming for his life. The back doors of the van were opened and the dogs, tugging against their leash, appeared to be ready to devour him whole. He was tossed inside like a piece of meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ferocity of the police dogs I saw that day was not a coincidence or accident, it was by design. South Africa, at one time, developed a breeding program at Roodeplaat Breeding Enterprises led by German geneticist Peter Geertshen to create a wolf-dog hybrid. Dogs were bred for their aggression and strength. The South African &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerboel&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boerboel&lt;/a&gt; is today one of the most powerful dog breeds in the world, and regularly kills in the United States, where it is imported from South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;22_Month_old_Boerboel&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-14442 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14442&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;22_Month_old_Boerboel&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/22_month_old_boerboel.jpg?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/22_month_old_boerboel.jpg?w=225&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/22_month_old_boerboel.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;540,720&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/black-lives-matter/22_month_old_boerboel/&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/22_month_old_boerboel.jpg?w=490&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After encounters with numerous Boerboels, Dobermans, Rottweilers and Pitbull dogs as a child in South Africa I am scared of dogs to this day. I know it’s not rational, and some of my best friends and family have dogs that I adore and love, but the fear lingers. Sometimes I come across a K-9 unit and the terror surfaces. Police dogs are potent police weapons here, today, just as they were in South Africa in the 1980s. There is a long history of this here. Dogs were used to terrorize blacks in the Civil Rights era, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/01/trump-vicious-dogs-protesters-civil-rights-slavery/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the recent invocation of “vicious dogs” by the president of the United States conjures up centuries of racial terror&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immigrated to America in August 1988, and imagined that here I would find a land free of the suffocating racism of South Africa. In my South African high school racism was open, accepted and embraced. Nigg*r balls were sold in the campus cafeteria (black licorice balls), and students would tell idiotic “jokes”  in which dead blacks were frequently the punchline. Some of the teachers were radically racist. My German teacher, Frau Webber, once told me and Tamir that she would swallow her pride and agree to teach us despite the fact that we were Jews. But much more pernicious was the systemic, underlying, racism. When I grew up the idea that someday I would go to university and study alongside a black person just seemed preposterous. My friends and I would talk about girls. The idea that any of us would ever date, let alone marry an African girl, was just completely and totally out of the realm of possibility. While my school, teachers and friends were what one would consider “liberal” in South Africa, e.g. many supported the ANC, their support of blacks was largely restricted to the right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, America was not the utopia I imagined. In 1989, a year after I immigrated here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yusef_Hawkins&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yusef Hawkins was murdered&lt;/a&gt; in a hate crime by white youths who thought he was dating a white woman. That was also the year of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5597843/central-park-five-trump-history/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Central Park Five&lt;/a&gt;“, in which Trump played a central, disgraceful and racist role. I finished high school in Palo Alto, across a highway from East Palo Alto, and the difference between the cities seemed almost as stark as between the white and black neighborhoods in South Africa. I learned later that this was the result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;redlining&lt;/a&gt;. My classmates and teachers in Palo Alto were obsessed, in 1989, with the injustices in South Africa. but never once discussed East Palo Alto with me or with each other. I was practicing for the SAT exams at the time and remember thinking Palo Alto : East Palo Alto = Pretoria : Mamelodi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years after that, when I was an undergraduate student studying at Caltech in Los Angeles, the Rodney King beating happened. I saw a black man severely beaten on television in what looked like a clip borrowed from South Africa. My classmates at the time thought it would be exciting to drive to South Central Los Angeles to see the “rioters” up close. They had never visited those areas before,  nor did they return afterwards. I was reminded at the time of the poverty tourism my friends in South Africa would partake in: a tour to Soweto accompanied by guides with guns to see for oneself how blacks lived. Then right back home for a braai (BBQ). My classmates came back from their Rodney King tour excitedly telling stories of violence and dystopia. Then they partied into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about my only classmate, one out of 200,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/edray-goins-black-mathematicians.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; who was actually from South Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and about the dissonance that was his life and my classmates’ partying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am a professor, and I am frequently present in discussions on issues such as undergraduate and graduate admissions, and hiring. Faculty talk a lot, sometimes seemingly endlessly, about diversity, representation, gender balance, and so forth and so on. But I’ve been in academia for 20+ years and it was only three years ago, after moving to Caltech, that I attended a faculty meeting with a black person for the first time. Sometimes I look around during faculty meetings and wonder if I am in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people?cat_one=Faculty&amp;amp;cat_two=all&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/academic%20staff&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;? How can I tell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is an opportunity for academics to reflect on the murder of George Floyd, and to ask difficult questions of themselves. It’s not for me to say what all the questions are or ought to be. I will say this: at a time when everything is &lt;em&gt;unprecedented &lt;/em&gt;(Trump’s tweets, the climate, the stock market, the pandemic, etc. etc.) the murder of George Floyd was completely &lt;em&gt;precedented.&lt;/em&gt; His words. The mode of murder. The aftermath. It has happened many times before, including recently. And so it is in academia. The fundamental racism, the idea that black students, staff, and faculty, are not truly as capable as whites, it’s simply a day-to-day reality in academia, despite all the talk and rhetoric to the contrary. Did any academics, upon hearing of the murder of George Floyd, worry immediately that it was one of their colleagues, George Floyd, Ph.D., working at the University of Minnesota who was killed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take the time today to read. I will pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316323543/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Long Walk to Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, and I will also read #BlackintheIvory. I may read some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alan Paton&lt;/a&gt;. I will pause to think about how my university can work to improve the recruitment, mentoring, and experience of black students, staff and faculty. Just some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these years since leaving South Africa I’ve had a recurring dream. I fly around Pretoria. The sun has just set and the Union Buildings are lit up, glowing a beautiful orange in the distance. The city is empty. My friends are not there. The man I saw pleading for his life in 1985 is gone. I wonder what the police did to him when he arrived at the police station. I wonder whether he died there, like many blacks at the time did. I fly nervously, trying to remember whether I have my passbook on me. I remember I’m classified white and I don’t need a passbook. I hear dogs barking and wonder where they are, because the city is empty. I wonder what it will feel like when they eat me, and then I remember I’m white and I’m not their target. I hope that I don’t encounter them anyway, and I realize what a privilege it is to be able to fly where they can’t reach me. Then I notice that I’m slowly falling, and barely clearing the slopes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckleneuk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Muckleneuk hill&lt;/a&gt;. I realize I will land and am happy about that. I slowly halt my run as my feet gently touch the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Extraordinary performance of semiconducting metal oxide gas sensors using dielectric excitation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Ritesh Kumar will talk about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems. Specifically, he will refer to the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of his previous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impedance spectroscopy is a powerful technique which has been applied to the design of instruments for characterising liquids and solids. The ‘impedance fingerprints’  obtained at various frequencies can be used to classify, define sensitivity, selectivity, linearity of systems. It uses a sweep of sinusoidal frequencies as perturbation signal at low voltage so as to remain in the linear and causal domain. In this talk, I will be presenting about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems in general and specifically the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of our previous works in the design of Electronic Tongue systems. The paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al.  shows that the run-of-the mill metal oxide gas sensors can act as high performance sensors using the impedance measurements. They show exemplary performance in terms of linearity, limit of detection, cross-sensitivity etc. This can pave way for the design of low cost and efficient electronic nose systems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Global estimate of the prevalence of bipolar disorders among homeless people</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11914</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/09/global-estimate-of-the-prevalence-of-bipolar-disorders-among-homeless-people/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/homeless-5210796_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, as many as 150 million people or roughly 2% of the global population are classified as homeless, and as many as 1.6 billion people (20% of the world population) lack adequate housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless people are more likely than the general population to have mental disorders. Evidence suggests that the vast majority of homelesss people suffer from mental, neurological, and substance disorders including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder (BD), substance use, and personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically to BD, numerous studies have reported that the prevalence estimates of BD might be substantially high among homeless people when compared to the general population. The reported prevalence estimates of BD among the homeless people range from 2.41% to 42.42% depending on the study. Several factors contribute to this wide range of prevalence rates, including: (1) the use of different instruments to assess BD; (2) the presence of comorbidities and other mental, substance use and physical health problems; and (3) the difference in sociodemographics and other characteristics of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological evidence suggests that the presence of BD among the homeless increases the likelihood that the person stays homeless for longer and increases the risks of mortality from suicide, drug use, and general medical conditions. It is also associated with an elevated risk of the vulnerability of the homeless person, such as criminality and violent victimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did we do this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homeless people have been disproportionately affected by BD, the global prevalence estimate of BD among homeless people is unknown.  We therefore systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the existing epidemiological data on the prevalence of BD worldwide. The findings of the study may assist the concerned bodies in the planning and implementation of better screening and management strategies to address the burden and impacts of BD among homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus to identify pertinent studies that reported the prevalence of BD among homeless people in March 2019.  A meta-analysis using a random effect model was conducted to pool the prevalence estimated from individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 3236 studies identified, 10 studies with 4300 homeless individuals were included in the final analysis. The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4%. This result is remarkably higher (11.35-fold higher) than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population. The prevalence of BD among the homeless was 10.0% in Europe and it was 13.2% in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4% which is remarkably higher than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do our findings imply? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we found that the prevalence of BD among homeless people was considerably high as compared to the reported prevalence in the general population. This result implies that greater attention and action are required to identify and treat BD among homeless people. In addition, the findings suggest the need for further studies evaluating the possible contributing factors for this remarkably high prevalence estimate of the disorder as well as better prevention and treatment strategies for this population group.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Published Peer Review: 1 Year Across PLOS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18224</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5JAZfOdbjp8/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last May, PLOS announced a new option for authors to publish their peer review history, and the support from our communities has been loud and clear. Since our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/12/celebrating-6-months-of-published-peer-review-at-plos/&quot;&gt;update 6 months ago&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve jumped from 800 to over 3,500 articles with published peer review history!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Publish Peer Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Opening access to the reviewer comments benefits readers who wish to dive deeper into a specific study. Comments from experts who reviewed the article that would traditionally remain unseen helps contextualize the research. Upcoming researchers can get a glimpse behind the curtains and see what sort of requests authors in their field were asked to address during revisions. If an author chooses to publish both a preprint and their peer review history, the process from first draft to final article can be learned from. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Those involved in the peer review process also benefit, as the potential for reviews to be made public further fosters an environment where authors, editors, and reviewers respectfully collaborate to deliver the best possible manuscript for their community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our First Year Publishing Peer Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By leaving the decision to opt-in for published peer review history with authors, we’ve seen a steady 39% opt-in rate among eligible manuscripts across all of PLOS. Of those 3,500 publications that agreed to participate in the last year, 60% have at least one signed review! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With this increased number of publications with peer review history under our belt, we’ve continued to see the highest opt-in rates in our journals publishing work in health or life-sciences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Within PLOS ONE, Oral Health (57%), Clinical Trials (51%), and Women’s Health (51% and 67 opt-ins) lead the pack in terms of opt-in percentage for subjects with over 20 opt-ins. We’re ecstatic to see so many articles dealing with public health providing access to expert reviewer opinions to further validate the studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing to Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We believe authors and reviewers should be in control of how their work is portrayed. Reviewers are given the choice to sign their comments, and authors choose to opt-in when they’ve received and had an opportunity to respond to all reviewer feedback, and their paper has been accepted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through this system, both roles work in tandem to drive a transition to more diverse, transparent peer review options. A reviewer who signs their name and provides substantial comments backed by evidence may entice an author to opt-in and have the reviewer’s comments published. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Alternatively, an author may entice a reviewer to sign their name if their paper is already participating in other aspects of open science, such as publishing a preprint or sharing data and code in a repository. Regardless of your role on a specific paper, you have the choice with PLOS to enact transparency in peer review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Transforming Landscape of Open Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Different forms of Open Review are taking hold and changing the evaluation process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/reimagining-review-in-a-world-of-preprints&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprint commenting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and other opportunities are being realized due to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/peer-review/summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;shift in research attitudes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The greater research community is more accepting than ever to Open Review concepts such as portable peer review (reviews that can be transferred across journals) or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/convening-the-review-commons-community&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review Commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a platform providing independent peer review prior to journal submission. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Recognizing the essential role of peer review, reviewers have more opportunities to claim credit for their difficult and constructive work. These changes are all opportunities for researchers to cultivate transparency in peer review and, across all sectors of science, improve context and trust. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: arXiv staff to participate in the #strike4blacklives</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=645</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The arXiv staff is deeply saddened and angered by the recent killings of George Floyd, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others. We recognize that Black people live with the injustices of systemic racism every day — and have for centuries — in North America and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge that in research, as in life, people often perpetuate bias and systemic racism, both consciously and unconsciously. Members of arXiv’s own physics community asked us to pause business-as-usual this week and join scientists participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.particlesforjustice.org/&quot;&gt;#strike4blacklives&lt;/a&gt;. Our US-based staff agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv is an essential, daily tool for most physicists, and Black physicists are faced with the simultaneous tasks of writing and reading papers, while also fighting for their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The strike is an idea that grew out of discussions among Black physicists and astronomers, and importantly one thing that it offers us is a day of rest,” says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;, professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire and co-organizer of the #strike4blacklives. “I want a day where I don’t have to worry that I’ve missed an important paper on the arXiv because I am stressed out while my non-Black colleagues happily keep going. The strike is not just about gathering people together to begin to take action, but it is also about a day of rest for the people most affected by this heated moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv will not mail a daily announcement on the evening of Tuesday, June 9, 2020. Submissions received at or after 14:00 ET Monday, June 8 and before 14:00 ET Wednesday, June, 10 will be announced at 20:00 ET Wednesday, June 10.  We also encourage authors to pause their submissions on Wednesday, June 10 to participate in the #strike4blacklives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage arXiv readers to use the time they would normally spend reading the daily announcement or submitting an article to instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.particlesforjustice.org/resources&quot;&gt;read about and discuss racism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shutdownstem.com/action&quot;&gt;how they will work in their own local and professional communities to address it&lt;/a&gt;. If you choose to participate, please consider tagging &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;@arXiv on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to let us know what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv was founded as an open and freely available service to disseminate scientific research, and, as such, is an equalizer and democratizer. The arXiv staff is proud of this heritage and at the same time we recognize there is still much work to be done. The staff is participating in the #strike4blacklives and #shutdownSTEM at the request of our community, and we encourage members of minority groups around the world who are underrepresented in science to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/arXivStrikeInput&quot;&gt;reach out to arXiv&lt;/a&gt; to help us understand how to serve you better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and Carnegie Mellon University announce APC-free open access publishing agreement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18206</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Um3afkRT6xE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following joint press release was issued on June 8, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a two-year open access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The evidence is undeniable — open access research enables the convergence of disciplines that drives scientific innovations,” said Keith Webster, dean of Libraries and director of Emerging and Integrative Media Initiatives for Carnegie Mellon University. “This agreement with PLOS gives our researchers more avenues to provide their work to the public, and, in doing so, increases readership and opportunities for societal impact.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Carnegie Mellon will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the two-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. CMU researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these two years and will not be charged any APC. This pilot will further PLOS’ mission of making open access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages and geographies.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The agreement with Carnegie Mellon University is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in open access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreements with the University of California and Iowa State University,” said Sara Rouhi, director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Protecting maternal and child health during an economic crisis: Lessons learned from the Great Recession</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=11932</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/06/04/protecting-maternal-and-child-health-during-an-economic-crisis-lessons-learned-from-the-great-recession/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/AdobeStock_52342066-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a nurse scientist and health services researcher. I was born and raised in a series of small towns in rural Washington State in the U.S. In September 2009, I returned to the Pacific Northwest to pursue a PhD. It was the height of the Great Recession (2008-2009) and I quickly became concerned that the recession was making it harder for people to access care in the kinds of resource-poor areas similar to where I grew up. I decided to focus my dissertation work on this area and started by carrying out interviews with public health stakeholders around Washington State. Interviews yielded widespread concern about the effects of the recession — particularly among maternal and child health (MCH) populations. Disparities in MCH outcomes like timing of entry to prenatal care (PNC), birth weight (BW), and infant mortality are long-standing and have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/maternal-infant-and-child-health&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; by race/ethnicity, geography and other social characteristics groupings like education and insurance status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the effects of the recession, I obtained de-identified birth certificate data from Washington State and Florida. Birth certificate data was a good fit because it allowed me to link to county level data including unemployment rate, local health department expenditures, and other community characteristics that were likely to change during the recession. Over the course of three related papers, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/journal/12552&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race and Social Problems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;my co-authors and I analyzed relationships between MCH outcomes and disparities before, during, and after the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Increases in disparities – worse outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12552-019-09272-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;first paper&lt;/a&gt;, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446274&quot;&gt;Healthy People protocols&lt;/a&gt; to assess the degree of disparities and the extent to which changes occurred during and after the Great Recession for seven MCH outcomes. As expected, we found that disparities increased for some groups during the recession. However, we surprised to find that there were more total increases in disparities in Washington than in Florida and more disparity increases after the Great Recession than during.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of increases only occurred during one recession period (i.e. during or after but not both), but disparities for some groups and some outcomes increased during both recession periods. For example, among non-Hispanic Black mothers who entered prenatal care late or not at all (late/no PNC) disparities increased (outcomes worsened) during both recession periods. Disparity increases also appeared to predominantly cluster by race/ethnicity and individual social characteristics rather than by geography. Based on these findings, we focused further research on factors contributing to increasingly disparate outcomes in timing of PNC initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Predictors of late/no prenatal care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2486-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;second paper,&lt;/a&gt; we used regression modeling to estimate relative contributions of individual, community, and local health department (LHD) variables on the probability of late/no PNC in Washington and Florida. Here, we found consistent contributions over time of individual-level maternal predictors for late/no PNC, the largest of which were young age and low education. However, we did identify changes in associations before compared to during the recession for some community and LHD-level predictors (e.g., % voting Republican, LHD expenditures) in non-beneficial directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, women enrolled in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic&quot;&gt;WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program&lt;/a&gt; had a lower probability of late/no PNC than those without WIC. These findings suggest that policy makers and providers should consider targeted outreach to pregnant women with high individual-level disadvantage characteristics—particularly those of young age or with low education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;WIC and improved outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02937-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;third paper&lt;/a&gt;, we studied interactions between enrollment in the WIC Program and individual characteristics in relation to birth weight. We focused on a high-need subset of the study population — those with Medicaid or no insurance. We found that WIC interactions were associated with higher birth weights for infants of mothers who were very young (age &amp;lt;14), received late/no PNC, and among non-Hispanic Black infants. These effects are illustrated in the figure below for birth weight in grams among Black compared to White infants and infants of very young mothers compared to mothers age 30-34, with and without WIC, both before and during the recession. While disparities persisted during both periods, with or without WIC, the gap narrowed for infants of mothers who received WIC during their pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11933&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11933&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/fig-1-300x219.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Reductions in the gap in birth weight in grams for race/ethnicity and maternal age with WIC interactions before and during the Great Recession in Washington State and Florida. From Blakeney et. al. 2020&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we learn from this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated unfolding economic and social crises bear similarities to the Great Recession and there are many lessons to be learned from it and applied to the current situation. Three key takeaways from our studies are summarized here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inequality in the U.S. continues to be multi-generational, with disparities in access to care and outcomes apparent before and at birth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Great Recession, disparities increased and widened in both Washington and Florida, despite differences in state-level economic circumstances and demographics, highlighting the need for dedicated public health funding and programs to support timely, ongoing data collection and analysis to identify and address disparities in care and outcomes at local, state, and federal levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight among the very young, Black, and late/no prenatal care enrollees. However, these benefits did not appear to extend to all groups. Thus, targeted outreach and/or program modifications may be needed to expand benefits to additional groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On June 2, 2020, arXiv’s executive director, Dr. Eleonora Presani, presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aas.org/meetings/aas236&quot;&gt;American Astronomical Society’s 236th meeting&lt;/a&gt;, held virtually. Below is a summary, first published &lt;a data-auth=&quot;NotApplicable&quot; href=&quot;https://aasnova.org/2020/06/03/aas-236-day-2/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on AAS Nova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-auth=&quot;NotApplicable&quot; href=&quot;https://astrobites.org/2020/06/02/astrobites-at-aas-236-day-2/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Astrobites&lt;/a&gt;, of her talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAS Publishing Exclusive: A Discussion with the arXiv Executive Director&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Alex Pizzuto&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the meeting started strong, featuring a discussion with arXiv Executive Director &lt;b&gt;Eleonora Presani&lt;/b&gt;, who detailed the current status and future outlook of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;open access archive service&lt;/a&gt; many of us know and love. Not only is Presani new to the role of executive director, but the role itself is only two months old, marking a step towards engaging with the scientific community more efficiently and productively. As someone equipped with both a PhD in astroparticle physics and more than 6 years of experience from a career in scientific publishing, Presani is extremely qualified to help execute the vision of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presani began her presentation with her own mantra on the dissemination of scientific research: “knowledge only exists if it is accessible.” As an organization, Presani believes that arXiv functions as the “enablers” for the sharing of this knowledge, and seeks to make accessible environments like arXiv; those which are for researchers, by researchers. To get a sense of the sheer volume of knowledge that passes through the arXiv servers, Presani quizzed her audience, revealing some dumbfounding statistics about the quantity of preprints that have been submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tweets from Astrobites&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-635 size-medium aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM-300x231.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that about half of the funding for arXiv &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/donate&quot;&gt;is from the community&lt;/a&gt; is a testament to the fact that arXiv exists to serve the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many organizations have been slowed to a halt by the tragic global pandemic, Presani assures us that arXiv is still working hard. Over the last few months, arXiv has rolled out user-driven classification, which alerts authors when they assign their papers to a category that disagrees with arXiv’s classification algorithm. They have also been executing operational stability drills and developing a COVID-19 moderation plan, to make sure that no matter what is going on in the world, scientists can stay connected through their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking more to the future, we were then told about arXiv’s 3-year strategic plan (picture below). This plan is broken down into three distinct user categories (readers, authors, moderators) and discusses how each of these users can benefit in three different areas (control, impact, and collaboration). In order to successfully execute this plan, however, arXiv requires our help and wants to hear from scientific communities like the AAS, in order to learn what researchers believe are the highest impact deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some specific tasks that the arXiv team is focusing on over the next 18 months. These include distributing some of their classification data to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets&quot;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to contribute to classification algorithms. Additionally, arXiv will be rolling out an update to TeXLive2020 and is actively working on improving their user disambiguation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing arXiv’s resources to decide which of these goals is completed first is no simple task. Presani highlighted how challenging it is to balance all of the lofty goals of arXiv with their limited resources and discussed how no changes should be rolled out until they are up to arXiv’s high standards, noting that “arXiv was launched in 1991, and when it launched, it was an extremely cutting-edge product and it stayed the same for 30 years. It’s important to find the right balance between being quick and keeping the high quality of the work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.17.05-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tweet from Astrobites&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-640 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.17.05-PM-300x236.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in helping arXiv execute their vision? There are a variety of ways to contribute.

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: A Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck framework for modeling large scale extracellular electrodiffusion surrounding morphologically detailed neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about the paper &quot;A Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck framework for modeling large scale extracellular electrodiffusion surrounding morphologically detailed neurons&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is cur- rently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracel- lular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneu- trality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentra- tions and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.&lt;/p&gt;

Deprivation. Xenophobia. Contamination. These are some of the fears related to COVID-19. Scores of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRmgzqnAyky3wO--t4pBDc2iw9rbMmKHjPw205p6wjQ/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Google Docs - not all are included here&quot;&gt;COVID questionnaires&lt;/a&gt; have popped up recently to assess fear, anxiety, stress, and depression related to the novel coronavirus and its massive disruption to daily life. Most are freely available for use as research tools, but few have been validated and peer reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taylor and colleagues (2020)&lt;/a&gt; were recently published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Anxiety Disorders&lt;/i&gt;. The authors propose a new COVID Stress Syndrome, and present evidence that the CSS subscales are intercorrelated (which is suggestive of a “coherent” condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To develop the CSS, representative samples of people in Canada (n=3,479) and the US (n=3,375) completed a 58-item survey on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an online survey platform&quot;&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/a&gt;. Factor analysis identified five subscales... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID danger and contamination fears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID fears about economic consequences &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID xenophobia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID compulsive checking and reassurance seeking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COVID traumatic stress symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and limited the questionnaire to 36 items. I'll note that “fears about economic consequences” were restricted to a lack of supplies at grocery stores and pharmacies, rather than fears of crushing debt, eviction, hunger, and homelessness because of unemployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can view this new syndrome as a context-related extension of OCD contamination fears, compulsive checking, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/health-anxiety-what-it-and-how-beat-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health anxiety&lt;/a&gt; (preoccupation with the possibility of serious illness). Indeed, convergent validity was confirmed by showing correlations with established measures of those conditions. Unique aspects of COVID Stress Syndrome &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; not seen in other diagnoses &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; include fears that grocery stores would run out of toilet paper,&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and especially a fear of foreigners (xenophobia). Xenophobia is promulgated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt; and amplified by bad actors on social media and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/21/21221007/anti-asian-racism-coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How the coronavirus is surfacing America’s deep-seated anti-Asian biases&quot;&gt;IRL&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think xenophobia (specifically, anti-Asian sentiment) is on the list of symptoms for any DSM diagnosis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it seems that a coherent condition called COVID Stress Syndrome would require racist beliefs and a fear of people who are Chinese, Chinese-American, or Chinese-Canadian.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The prevalence of COVID Stress Syndrome in their Canadian and American  samples was not specified, nor was the cut-off point for such a diagnosis. Plenty of Americans are xenophobic, but they don't have bad dreams about coronavirus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an editorial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300451&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taylor and Asmundson (2020)&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;It appears that people who develop COVID Stress Syndrome have pre-existing psychopathology, particularly pre-existing high levels of health anxiety and obsessive-compulsive checking and contamination symptoms. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It remains to be seen whether the COVID Stress Syndrome is simply an adjustment disorder, abating once the pandemic is over, or whether it will become chronic for some individuals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much about COVID-19 “remains to be seen”, and this level of uncertainly is a major source of anxiety on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The toilet paper question just missed the cut...included were worries about water, cleaning supplies, medications, etc. The original version also included “worry about looting &amp;amp; rioting.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; One could really say &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;East Asian people more broadly.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed our PLOS Blogs Network has a fresh new look.  What’s changed? A cleaner design, better user experience and enhanced search. What hasn’t? The same great content from our independent bloggers and staff contributors.  Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll find on the ‘new and improved’ Network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Blogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolutely Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Meta-scientist Hilda Bastian writes about evidence and bias in medicine, and the culture of science. The blog is illustrated with her own cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dnascience.plos.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Geneticist Ricki Lewis blogs from the cutting edge of genomics, including genetic testing, stem cells, gene therapy and more&lt;/p&gt;
