	<title>Brain Blogger: Asperger’s Syndrome: Hallmark of Genius, or Just Another Form of Autism?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23664</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/28/aspergers-syndrome-hallmark-of-genius-or-just-another-form-of-autism/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin—what unites these three exceptional individuals? It is widely accepted that all three were geniuses, but there is something else. These days, neuroscientists believe that all three suffered from a specific neurological disorder called Asperger’s syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole definition of the term “&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/25/scholarship-for-college-students-living-with-a-neurological-disorder/&quot;&gt;neurological disorder&lt;/a&gt;” implies that something is going wrong in the brain. However, there is a growing recognition of the fact that when it comes to the processes in our brain, “going wrong” does not necessarily mean “going bad”. Our brain is too complicated a mechanism to be interpreted in simplistic terms. Some neurological disorders produce a peculiar state of mind often associated with high artistic and scientific achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) is a developmental and neurological disorder that is often associated with symptoms of social withdrawal, motor clumsiness, and impaired communication skills. &lt;em&gt;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM-5)&lt;/em&gt; classified AS in the same category as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/16/new-link-between-autism-and-the-gut-microbiota/&quot;&gt;Autism Spectrum Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ASD). It is often referred to as ‘High-functioning’ Autism (HFA), as individuals with AS are more intellectually capable and show less severe abnormalities compared to ASD subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of AS and autism started in the 1940s, when two Viennese Scientists, Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, described a syndrome observed in some children, with the unique characteristics of social isolation, impaired communication skills, and restrictive and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/10/when-hoarding-becomes-dangerous/&quot;&gt;obsessive interests&lt;/a&gt;. Both scientists used the term ‘autistic’ in their reports.  While Kanner’s syndrome was published right away in 1943, Asperger’s report was written in German and remained undiscovered until 1991 when it reappeared in Uta Frith’s textbook &lt;em&gt;Autism and AS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and publications on Asperger’s syndrome reached its peak during 2000-2012. Different research groups proposed a set of criteria for AS diagnosis. While several of these criteria were overlapping, WHO’s International Classification of Diseases and Disorders set the following key characteristics that can be diagnostic for Asperger’s Syndrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualitative social impairment involving dysfunctional social adaptivity, impaired non-verbal communication for interaction and lack of social reciprocity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrictive pattern of interest, motor clumsiness, repetitive behavior, and extreme obsessiveness to specific rituals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AS patients must show age-specific, normal cognitive and linguistic development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the father of Asperger Syndrome, Hans Asperger, described AS patients to be characteristically distinct from ASD subjects. He characterized them as intellectually-able, abstract-loving, and even overachieving in some specific cognitive domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades after Asperger’s observation, recent studies have also found that AS patients often demonstrate high verbal IQ, strong grammatical skills and they often outperform others in fluid reasoning although they are reported to show a delayed reaction time with poor performance IQ, specifically in symbol coding and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, AS is more common than &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/02/causes-of-autism-remain-mysterious/&quot;&gt;classical autism&lt;/a&gt;. Epidemiological surveys report that about 4 out of every 10,000 children are autistic whereas about 25 out of 10,000 children are diagnosed with AS. AS is more common in boys than girls. No scientific explanation behind this observation exists at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with many other syndromes, no single specific cause is responsible for AS. Rather, a milieu of factors is associated with its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children diagnosed with AS show a genetic pattern, like in autism, where at least one of the parents (most often the father) is diagnosed with AS or at least have some hallmark AS characteristics. The relatives of AS children are known to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/&quot;&gt;anxiety or depression related disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important causal factor behind the development of AS might be the altered level of neurotransmitters. In AS patients, higher levels of N-Acetyl Aspartate/Choline (precursor of acetylcholine) intake and increased dopamine levels were reported, suggesting an overall altered dopaminergic neurotransmitter composition in major areas of the brain. Intranasal injection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/04/the-multiple-faces-of-love-hormone-oxytocin/&quot;&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropeptide, was shown to improve facial emotion recognition abilities in AS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from alterations in neurotransmitter levels, neuroimaging studies show that there are structural changes in major areas of the brain that could be associated with the development of Asperger’s Syndrome. Altered grey and white matter volumes were observed in major brain regions, and an abnormal thickness of the hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex was reported to be the major contributing factor for dysregulated cognitive functions in AS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers also proposed that environmental factors can contribute indirectly to the development of AS. Viral or bacterial infection and smoking during pregnancy particularly increases the risk factor, although no concrete evidence supporting these views was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the substantial number of overlapping similarities between Asperger’s Syndrome and Autism, it is very easy to confuse one with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in recent decades showed differences between AS and ASD on both quantitative and qualitative levels. The AS subjects displayed age-specific or earlier verbal development, meticulous speech ability, higher desire for social reciprocation, and supreme imagination compared to ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cognitive level, AS subjects are more perceptive, they possess superior verbal performance and visual-spatial ability compared to ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the major limitations of these studies is the huge variability within the study groups and contradictions in the data patterns, as with age, the distinction between AS and ASD significantly reduces. It is particularly difficult to categorize AS from other disorders as there are no known biomarkers specific to AS only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there is not sufficient evidence of distinguishable characteristics for AS that can class the syndrome as ‘one biologically and clinically diagnosed entity’, the DSM-V in 2013 revised and categorized Asperger’s Syndrome as another variant of ASD. Although this decision was criticized by the scientific community, most of the researchers agreed that there is a need to conduct more studies that could help in distinguishing AS from other ASDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most general misconception about Asperger’s syndrome or, as a matter of fact, about autism spectrum disorders in general, is that they develop because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/13/how-attachment-and-parenting-style-affect-adult-relationships/&quot;&gt;poor parenting and a lack of bonding&lt;/a&gt; between parents and their child. This concept was even termed as ‘Refrigerator Mother’ to describe cold and distant parenting. But this notion was challenged from the 1960’s when research on these neurological disorders started to grow and scientists found that it is not parenting, but rather the genetic and neurological makeup of the child that is responsible for these syndromes.  Even today, the belief that neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a traumatic childhood are common. The reality, however, is more complicated than our guesses based on limited information.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our exciting new journal, CVIR Endovascular, has now published its first articles. We invited the Editor in Chief, Prof Jim A. Reekers to share his views on our new open access and open peer reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Reekers, can you tell us about the CIRSE society and their support and involvement in the journal? What made the society decide to partner with SpringerNature to launch CVIR Endovascular?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) is a non-profit scientific and educational society that was founded in 1985 with the aim to “improve patient care through the support of teaching, science, research and clinical practice in the field of cardiovascular and interventional radiology”....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over the past two weeks, public allegations of abuse at the (formerly) open-access journal HAU have touched off what one scholar has called “a fractal socio-technical controversy exploding in all directions.” Anchored, in part, by the Twitter channel #hautalk, responses from scholars across career stages have grappled with issues from power and privilege in a time of academic precarity to the status of the anthropological canon. Projects with no institutional connection to HAU have come forward to explain how they operate and what values guide their work. And while few have seriously suggested that the failings of one journal should cast doubt on the viability of open-access publishing more broadly, at least one commenter has lamented that we do not yet have a sustainable and ethical model of open access around which to organize. In this post, we want to argue that such models already abound and that anthropologists ought to rally around them, rather than regarding open access as a proleptic promise that never quite arrives. The six of us draw on our firsthand experience as participants in a variety of publishing projects and observers of the scholarly communication landscape in anthropology and adjacent fields. We affirm, informed by scholars of indigenous and traditional knowledge, that openness is not an untrammeled good, and we endorse the cultivation of a diverse publishing ecology in which experiments can flourish and one size need never fit all. Yet, as the executive committee of an open-access publishing cooperative called Libraria, we also put forward our actually existing model of open-access publishing and invite engagement with it in the here and now....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Library of Congress Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program enables undergraduate and graduate students to experience the integrated analog and digital collections and services of the world's largest, all-inclusive library. Working under the direction of Library curators and specialists in various divisions, fellows explore digital initiatives and increase access to the institution’s unparalleled collections and resources. Fellows are exposed to a broad spectrum of library work: copyright, preservation, reference, access, and information technology. In the past, summer fellows have identified hundreds of historical, literary, artistic, cinematic and musical gems representing the Library’s rich cultural, creative and intellectual assets. No previous experience is necessary, but fellowships are competitive and special skills or knowledge are usually desired. Selections are based on academic achievement, letters of recommendation, and an interview with a selection official...&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: NeuroDojo: Does biorXiv have different rules for different scientists?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-biorxiv-have-different-rules-for.html</guid>
	<link>http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-biorxiv-have-different-rules-for.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Last year, I submitted a preprint to biorXiv. I was underwhelmed by the experience. But I am a great believer in the saying, “Never try something once and say, ‘It did not work.’” (Sometimes attributed to Thomas Edison, I think.) I submitted another manuscript over the weekend which I thought might be a little more suited to preprinting, so after I submitted it to the journal, I went and uploaded it to biorXiv. It was the weekend, so it sat until Monday. Today, I received a reply. My preprint was rejected....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my criticisms of preprints is that they would make the Matthew Effect for publication worse. People who are in well-known labs at well-known institutions would receive the lion’s share of attention. People who are not would have just another expectation with minimal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this feels even worse. This feels like there’s one set of rules for the rank and file scientists (“No commentaries!”) and another set of rules for scientists with name recognition (“Why yes, we’d love to have your commentary.”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I like the idea of preprints, but this is leaving a sour taste in my mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Researchers say it is mistaken to see sexting as “simply harmful”</title>

&lt;p&gt;Is sexting a good thing, because it’s sexually liberating, or a bad thing, because it’s objectifying? Separate research groups have put forward both arguments. But according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2018.1438576&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of college students in Hong Kong, it’s both.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that roughly half of US college students (on which most research in this area has been done) send nude or sexually provocative images by phone or the internet. In the new study, reported in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Sex Research&lt;/i&gt;, the proportion was lower (13.6 per cent), perhaps because Chinese culture has a lower level of sexual permissiveness, but sexting was still relatively common, with almost one in five men and one in ten women saying they do it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34103&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors Mario Liong at Ritsumeikan University in Japan and Grand H.L. Cheng at the Duke-National University of Singapore, point out, some researchers have argued that sexting promotes objectification – the presentation of the body as an object to be judged, generally by prevailing cultural standards. But others have argued that it empowers people sexually, as they can be in more control of their own sexuality than they might be during a physical encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate who might be right, Liong and Cheng recruited 361 students, aged between 17 and 24, who filled in questionnaires that asked first whether they had ever sexted, and then assessed their views on so-called “body surveillance” (how often during the day they think about how they look, for example); feelings of body shame (they had to report the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements like “I feel ashamed of myself when I haven’t made the effort to look my best”); body control beliefs (“I can weigh what I’m supposed to when I try hard enough”, for instance); and, finally, comfort with nudity (for example, participants rated their comfort with situations such as “Being totally nude while sitting with a nude significant other”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that among both men and women sexters had higher levels of body surveillance, which seemed to mediate their higher levels of body shame. But they were also more comfortable with nudity than non-sexters. There was no relationship between sexting and body control beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased body shame clearly isn’t desirable. But a greater comfort with nudity likely is, and this finding relates to experiences reported by erotic performers on live video cameras, the researchers argue: “When sexters pose erotically to take sexual pictures, they develop a liberated sexual subjectivity and become more comfortable with their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that sexting is generally seen by authority figures – educators, parents and policymakers – as being unequivocally bad, whereas they believe their new results show it’s important to “break with [this] idea that sexting is simply harmful”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers did only capture a snapshot in time, however, so it’s possible that the influences go the other way: people who are more comfortable with being nude are more likely to sext, and to experience self-objectification in the process. Longitudinal studies will be needed to investigate further. Also, this study did not look at whether the frequency of sexting had any impact, or whether there might be different effects for homosexual vs. heterosexual men and women. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers readily point out, “More research is needed to understand the ways in which digital media have transformed sexuality and how individuals make use of this new tool to assert their sexual agency, despite being simultaneously constrained by it.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Liberal government has emphasized the importance of open data and open government policies for years, yet the government has at times disappointed in ways both big (Canada’s access-to-information laws are desperately in need of updating and the current bill does not come close to solving its shortcomings) and small (restrictive licensing and failure to comply with access to information disclosures). For example, late last year, I noted that government departments had oddly adopted a closed-by-default approach to posting official photographs on Flickr. Unlike many other governments that use open licenses or a public domain approach, Canadians looking for openly licensed photographs for inclusion in learning materials, blog posts, or other content must rely on foreign governments.  The restrictive licensing approach remains in place: those seeking photos on Flickr from the G7 will find Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s are “all rights reserved” but other governments attending the summit – including the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, and South Africa – all facilitate re-use of their photos through open licensing....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the heals of being inspired at #scifoo at GoogleX, I’m a little fired up.  Monday morning at the American Library Association meeting–after flight delays, a red eye flight, too few hours of sleep, and perhaps just one to many cups of coffee–I spoke in a session on science communication.   Below is the energized list of 10 items I thought were needed. ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. We need to make sure good and correct information is more accessible and more viral than bad information.  We need to make it easier for students and the public to get the information they need to be an informed citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Science needs to be more open.  Open access publishing, science communication, and citizen science and other initiatives were good start of a larger “open” movement.  But now we need to swing the doors of science open a little wider.  We are not open or honest to our failures in the enterprise of science.  Metal health issues, inequality, profiteering, and harassment run rapid.  We need change and a river in Egypt isn’t the first step....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Abstract:  Digital technology is gaining in importance - not only in life and work, but also ineducation and training. The availability of quality educational materials to prepare learners for work and life is a key factor to ensure an inclusive and equitable global society. A growing number of platforms with Open Educational Resources (OER) provide access to high-quality educational materials related to skills development. In times in which the development of knowledge is increasingly dynamic, openness in itself has emerged as a quality in education. In this context, it is key to realize the benefits of OER in the area of technical and vocational education and training (TVET)....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Educational Resources for skills dvelopment (OER in TVET). This brochure gives an introduction to Open Educational Resources, the history of the concept, and its current and potential use with a particular view to TVET. The publication includes a brief summary of a study UNEVOC commissioned in 2017 which looked at the potential of OER to improve access to quality TVET&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Open science is a fundamental scientific norm, prescribing unconditional sharing of scientific discoveries and resources among academic scientists. However, the past decades have seen a growing orientation toward commercialization and privatization of science. In this seminar, I discuss a fundamental conflict between commercialization (private ownership) and openness, drawing on a sample of university scientists in Japan/UK/Germany. I investigate the evolution of norms and behaviors in commercialization and openness under the current policy context. The result suggests that commercialization is indeed in conflict with openness, potentially leading to the fragmentation of science. Policy implications are discussed....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Don Kalb: HAU not: For David Graeber and the anthropological precariate @FocaalBlog</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;When HAU was launched, my grad students at Central European University were celebrating. Open access! Finally, a breach in the wall that separated the haves from the have-nots. Their local universities in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe hardly had the resources to pay for these Western journals offered at extortionate prices by the likes of Elsevier, Springer, Oxford, Chicago. Indeed, even CEU did not have sufficient means to pay all the subscriptions that scholars were asking for. Now the have-nots would finally have unlimited access. More, the HAU journal preached what it imagined itself to embody: self-conscious intellectual revolution in the apparently newly found horizontalist mode: Occupy anthropology! For the intellectual assertion of the commons! My rightly rebellious students loved it. And went on producing some great open access undertakings—but not in academia—that helped to feed the ongoing mobilizations in their countries (most prominently: http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast). They had all my support while we continued to disagree about HAU....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now know that the executive man at the top was all but kind and honest. It is good that his excesses have been exposed in a remarkable anthropological #MeToo moment. Interestingly, this was allowed to come into the open through an informal alliance between David Graeber, who was crudely disposed of his role as “Editor at Large” after clashing with da Col, and the exploited workers. On their own, Graeber or the HAU precariate would never have gotten so much public attention. It was their alliance that allowed Graeber an attack that was not just selfish, and Graeber’s gesture allowed the frustrations of the precariate to be publicized and get attention....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;Far-reaching integration European Open Science Cloud requires major action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is taking steps towards what is called the European Open Science Cloud. In that title is a lot of decided: open, science and cloud to start. But also a major transition from existing to new, integrated policy. What is this about, what is the intention and what are the steps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the Dutch universities have connections up to 100 Gbyte per second? Did you know that the SKA project (Square Kilometer Array) will ask for more data transport than ten times the current global internet traffic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Europe has a functioning supercomputer infrastructure, consisting of several TOP500-rated supercomputers, and that there are European data and grid infrastructures for supporting science in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you share the vision (pdf) of the High Level Expert Group of the European Commission that 90 percent of the data in the world has been generated in the past two years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, perhaps not, but these are the starting points for a major action aimed at deeply integrating these reasonably independent infrastructures into one coherent infrastructure, with the open sharing of data as the primary guideline....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;8 principles for transforming scientific communication. From words to facts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement of last April, the University of California proposed 18 principles to transform scientific communication from a closed, subscription-based publishing system to an open, fair, transparent and sustainable system, where scientific works are freely accessible to all. . These principles will now guide the University of California in bargaining with publishers. The distance from European and Italian positions appears to be sidereal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement of last April the University of California proposed a series of principles that can facilitate the transformation of scientific communication from a closed, subscription-based publishing system to an open system, where scientific works are freely accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'In summary, while publishers are doing everything to reduce the rights and academic freedom of authors, we believe that our proposal can help to restore a balance, to give researchers greater control over the fruit of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'These principles have the potential to transform the system of scientific communication from closed and inaccessible to a more open, fair, transparent and sustainable system....'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: But You Can’t Do That in a STEM course! | Hybrid Pedagogy</title>

	<link>http://hybridpedagogy.org/do-in-a-stem-course/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...In A Call for Critical Instructional Design, Sean Michael Morris explains why he doesn’t use traditional rubrics or learning objectives when he teaches. He argues that “participation is an individual choice”; “learner contributions are meaningful content in the course”; and “there are no ‘right’ answers to the questions I’m bound to ask.” Many who teach in the ‘hard’ or ‘natural’ sciences might say: “That is just great for those of you who teach in the humanities, but you can’t do that in a STEM class!” While I consider the work that I’ve been doing with my biology courses a pilot study on a pathway towards more deeply engaged experiments, my experiences using open pedagogy strategies suggests that yes, yes you can. When I was a biology undergraduate years ago, nearly all of my science classes were in large lecture halls. Content was delivered by lecturers, and students spit back answers on multiple choice exams primarily graded by Scantron. We’ve come a long way since then, with many science teachers incorporating more active learning in their courses, developing powerful case studies (check out the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science), and using jigsaw strategy, discussion groups, peer review, open-ended research projects, co-ops, service-learning, and more. But these active learning strategies, while adding a great deal to the teaching of science, can often still fall short of what I consider to be the most salient and powerful features of open pedagogy. Inspired by the ideas of Robin DeRosa (see Open Pedagogy at the Program Level, and What is Open Pedagogy?), for me, this includes 1) student agency, and 2) a commons-oriented approach to education — both of which encapsulate the ideals of equity, access, connection, and sharing. When we blend the best of what we have learned from those who have labored to transform education with ideas integral to feminist pedagogy, engaged pedagogy, constructivist pedagogy, and critical digital pedagogy, and then embed them in a larger commons paradigm, open pedagogy emerges....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/universities-minister-launches-open-data-competition</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Universities Minister Sam Gyimah has launched a £125,000 competition for tech companies and coders to develop new digital tools to help students pick the university course that is best for them. The new tools will help level the playing field between applicants, giving all students access to evidence on earnings and employment outcomes from different degrees. Recent research published by the Government has shown that what students study and where really matters to their future life chances. In many other areas of life, from utility bills to hospital care, technology has put better information at our fingertips. These new tools will help enable a similar revolution in transparency in Higher Education. The competition, which opened on 25 June, will harness the creativity, talent and ingenuity of coders and developers to design accessible digital tools, such as mobile apps, that will make it easier for young people to find out what they might earn if they choose a particular subject at a specific university. This is part of a wider revolution in transparency in Higher Education data - the government is already publishing a wide range of data including on likely earnings and employability and teaching quality at universities, also known as TEF. Sam Gyimah now wants to make it even easier for young people to use information like this to help choose where to study....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Young European Research Universities Network (YERUN) is committed to actively support the transition towards Open Science. The YERUN members agree that this transition requires not only investments in infrastructures and skills-building, but also a cultural shift in the way research is performed and rewarded. As an active member of the EU Open Science Policy platform, YERUN develops alternatives and provides recommendations to making Open Science a reality. However, active leadership and determination are needed to overcome existing challenges and promote a coherent implementation of this transition. In the coming years, the YERUN members will share experiences and resources, pilot (joint) actions and encourage best-practice exchange across the network and beyond. In doing so, YERUN aims to be a pioneer in the transition process.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since 2015, the National Library of Finland and the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies have been working on a joint project which aims to provide the journals with the support they need for making a transition to open access. The project has launched an OJS-based shared publication platform (Journal.fi), which is already used by 50 journals. It has also been developing a new funding model for the journals. Since the subscription and licensing costs paid by the research libraries for these journals have been very small, it is not possible to simply use these funds to pay for open access. Instead, the project has been working on a consortium-based model, under which the Finnish research organizations and funders would commit themselves to providing long-term funding to the journals. In return, the journals would pledge to follow strict standards in openness, licensing, peer review and infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;A group of open science advocates have launched the first preprint aimed exclusively at African scientists. AfricArxiv seeks to improve the visibility of African science by helping academics share their work quickly, say co-founders Justin Ahinon, a web developer and student in applied statistics at the National School of Statistics, Planning and Demography in Parakou, Benin, West Africa, and Jo Havemann, a trainer at the science communication consultancy, Access 2 Perspectives, based in Berlin, Germany. They hope the preprint will increase collaboration among researchers, and make knowledge more accessible to policymakers, entrepreneurs, medical staff, farmers, journalists, among other stakeholders. The platform will be hosted on the Open Science Framework (OSF), a free, open-source software that allows researchers to connect and share their work. It will support preprints, postprints, code and data, and welcomes submissions from all African languages, including Akan, Twi, Swahili and Xhosa....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://archivalia.hypotheses.org/72782</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;How can memory institutions turn into innovative museums?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation at the Librarian's Day in Berlin (June 13, 2018), supplemented by some links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Zurich Jesuits still believe in the book&quot;, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung wrote an enthusiastic article on the opening of the Jesuit library in Zurich at the end of February. Quote: &quot;The director of the ETH-Bibliothek, Rafael Ball, said two years ago, the Internet makes libraries superfluous. The Provincial of the Swiss Jesuits, Father Christian Rutishauser SJ, counters this. He is optimistic and convinced: &quot;A library does not only provide knowledge transfer. Information and daily updates are digitally accessible. However, education - a precondition of democracy - requires intensive, profound debate. And there the book is indispensable. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 30th of June, Pforzheim-based Auction House Kiefer will be bringing numerous old prints from the old stock of the Zurich Jesuit Archive, which has entered the library, under the hammer . There are also some prints from the 16th century from the important library of the Upper Swabian Premonstratensian monastery in Weissenau near Ravensburg. The Handbook of Historical Books in Switzerland in 2011 included 239 volumes of this provenance in Jesuit possession. In 1995, Helmut Binder found only about 50 volumes in Zurich in his attempt to reconstruct the routes of the Weißenau books scattered all over the world....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing is the magic word. The memory institutions of citizen science open far too timidly, although those who tried it often had very good experiences. Whether it's correcting newspaper OCRs, copying genealogical documents or historical menu cards, georeferencing cards, or identifying old photos, there is currently a great need for public knowledge. Of course, a reference to Wikipedia and Wikisource may not be missing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the foreground should not be the commercial social media like Facebook or Instagram for the memory institutions, but the Web 2.0 of the citizen scientists. Ultimately, only the consensus of society can safeguard the legitimacy of culture and thus also of the humanities-oriented memory institutions....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Possible link between blind cavefish and Autism</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/27/possible-link-between-blind-cavefish-and-autism/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Astyanax_fasciatus_Mexican_blind_cavefish_1_15719439215-e1530093880320-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican Tetra come in two distinct forms: the river dwelling surface fish and the far stranger cavefish, which have no eyes, and are found in isolated caves in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface fish are typical river fish, they school; sleep at night, pay well-balanced attention to food, predators and mates; and calmly hover while resting. In contrast, cavefish swim continuously; rarely interact with mates or sleep; exhibit repetitive behavior patterns like circling around at the middle of a water column; and they have higher levels of cortisol, the anxiety hormone, in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10318&quot; style=&quot;width: 308px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10318&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cavefish-298x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The two forms of Mexican Tetra: surface fish and cavefish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These symptoms have similarities with those exhibited by people diagnosed with ASD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/symptoms&quot;&gt;characterized by&lt;/a&gt; having difficulty in socially interacting with others, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, imbalanced attention, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not believe that these shared behaviors between human and fish are at the same level of complexity but they seem to be driven by evolutionarily conserved neural wirings. For example, emotion-based behavior, attention, socialness, and sleep regulation are based on conserved neural networks in the brain, such as the cortical region, thalamus, hypothalamus and habenula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings from our recent study suggest that behaviors that we have observed in cavefish are evolutionarily conserved between fish and human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASD-risk genes in cavefish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made comprehensive surveys for cavefish orthologs (genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor) of human ASD-risk genes. By referring to these genes, we found some surprising similarities between cavefish and human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the orthologs of ASD-risk genes in cavefish and ASD patients shared the same polarities of gene expressions (up or down-regulation of gene expression). This level of similarity is very high compared with other ASD rodent models and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10319&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-10319&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/lab-setup-1024x356.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Lab setup&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Mexican Tetra: surface fish &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage and found that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. Interestingly, ASD-risk genes are also positively selected in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently testing human ASD treatment drugs for fish social behaviors. We suggest that fish and human evolution share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We and other groups believe that many cavefish behaviors are beneficial to finding food in the dark. But how did ASD-risk genes evolve in humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human geneticist &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006618&quot;&gt;Polimanti et al.&lt;/a&gt; and others state that ASD is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, college completion, and years of schooling. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3863&quot;&gt;Weiner et al.&lt;/a&gt; suggest many of ASD-risk genes are thought to provide cumulative effects that can lead to ASD. In other words, if you have a few ASD-risk mutations, you may have a better academic success; however, if you have mutations in many ASD-risk genes you have higher risk to express ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASD like behaviors in other species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from cavefish, we do not know of any animal models that naturally show a series of autism-related behaviors. However, a recent study by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9653&quot;&gt;Shpigler et al.&lt;/a&gt; suggested that ASD-risk genes are an evolutionary conserved gene set that regulates socialness in both honeybees and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have limited knowledge of the evolution of socialness and other behaviors in the context of adaptation because many of these behaviors are complex and are regulated by multiple genes. Based on the comparative studies between human, cavefish, and bee, it is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to test whether a set of ASD-risk genes are repeatedly targeted in other rapidly evolving species such as cichlid fishes in the lakes of East Africa, Trinidad guppies, and green anole lizards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of ASD-like behaviors, deer mice are known to show repetitive behavior under the novel environment. In addition, there are a number of domestic mutant mice including BTBR mice, and gene knock out-mice, which have lost the functions of ASD-risk genes. Many of them are characterized with their impairments in social interaction, lack of interest in cohorts, altered vocalization pattern, and stereotypic repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are suggested as ASD-like behaviors by sharing the molecular and neural mechanisms to express ASD-like behaviors. However, these models do not overlap with systemic defects seen in ASD such as immune deficiency or impairment of digestive system. As we start characterizing that cavefish shows similar changes in both systems in addition to a set of ASD-like behaviors, we believe that cavefish can also fill a gap of systemic understanding of ASD, and can provide a foundation for new ASD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Can psychology help us to be funnier?&lt;/strong&gt; Our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginnysmithscience.com&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt; hears how a key ingredient of humour is “incongruity” and the surprise of unexpected meanings. Individual words too can be amusing, but actually most of the time we laugh not because we’ve seen or heard a joke, but as a natural part of friendly interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are: Cardiff University neuroscientist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deanburnett.com&quot;&gt;Dean Burnett&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Happy Brain&lt;/em&gt;; psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas_Engelthaler&quot;&gt;Tomas Engelthaler&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Warwick, who co-authored a paper on the funniest words in English; and “stand up scientist” &lt;a href=&quot;https://speechcommunicationlab.weebly.com&quot;&gt;Sophie Scott&lt;/a&gt; at UCL, who gave the 2017 Christmas lectures on the neuroscience of voices, speech and laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Gallbladder cancer: a rare, deadly disease with an abnormally high incidence in Native American populations of New Mexico</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/26/gallbladder-cancer-a-rare-deadly-disease-with-an-abnormally-high-incidence-in-native-american-populations-of-new-mexico/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gallbladder is a pear shaped organ located within the abdomen of the human body. The primary function of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate the bile fluid produced by the human liver. Bile fluid plays an integral role in the digestion and absorption of fats from the human gut. However, due to its function as a bile concentrating organ, the gallbladder is also prone to develop gallstones. Gallstone disease is one of the commonest reasons why humans undergo a surgical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere; however it is still the fifth commonest malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract. Annually, there are roughly 4000-5000 new cases of gallbladder cancer diagnosed in the United States. A vast majority of the gallbladder cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages of disease (stage III and above) resulting in poor clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean survival after a gallbladder cancer diagnosis is a mere six months. The five year survival (a metric to assess cancer outcomes) is less than 3-8% for stage III gallbladder cancer and above. It is one of the deadliest cancers we know of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallbladder cancer incidence has a unique global distribution as well. Most of the cancers known to mankind tend to be relatively uniformly distributed across countries and continents. In contrast, gallbladder cancer incidence is increased in geographically distinct locations of the world. These include places such as Chile, Northern parts of India and the state of New Mexico in the United States. What are the common drivers unique to these locations leading to increased gallbladder cancer incidence? We do not know for sure at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10299&quot; style=&quot;width: 1956px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10299 size-full&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/fig1.png&quot; width=&quot;1946&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Gallbladder incidence data (2000-2014) mapped to the counties of New Mexico. Darker blue indicates an increase in gallbladder cancer cases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;From Fig 2, Nemunaitis et al&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;In addition to the unique geographical distribution, people of specific ethnicities appear to be more prone to gallbladder cancer as well. This includes the Native American populations of the North American continent. Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state. While there are a multitude of risk factors that have been implicated in the causation of gallbladder cancer, there are no definitive associations. In our current review, we discuss these issues along with some likely factors implicated in the process of development of gallbladder cancers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature is the elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer in women compared to men. Gallbladder cancer is one of the few cancers which has an elevated female incidence relative to men. Women are prone to develop gallstones in general. However, this does not explain the complete risk associated with increased gallbladder cancer development seen among women. Higher levels of estrogen may be one of the risk factors needed to drive gallbladder cancers and we need more research to understand its role in the development of this cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10301&quot; style=&quot;width: 1956px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10301 size-full&quot; height=&quot;909&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/12885_2018_4575_Fig1_HTML.png&quot; width=&quot;1946&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Gallbladder incidence in women compared to men of New Mexico from 2000 to 2014.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Figure 1, Nemunaitis et al&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant drawback in our understanding of gallbladder cancer is the lack of readily available cell line and animal models. Additionally, funding for gallbladder cancer research is very limited, impeding our understanding of this disease. In order to make a dent in this disease, global collaborative efforts are critically needed through pooled resources and improving the collective knowledge of this disease across institutions. Instances of such collaborative efforts include the Chile Gallbladder Cancer Pilot Study and the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study led by Dr Jill Koshiol at the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease. With the new emerging focus on personalized medicine/oncology, research into targetable markers in gallbladder cancer patients is urgently required. Interestingly, gallbladder and biliary tract cancers appear to have an interesting array of potential molecular targets which may be amenable to targeted therapeutics. Clinical trials and basic research efforts are urgently needed to establish the validity of these approaches to move the translational research findings back to gallbladder cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue which we highlight in our review is the issue related to rural oncology healthcare access. New Mexico is a predominantly rural state. Native Americans in the state live on reservations which are far-flung, lacking immediate access to oncology care. This means that the gallbladder cancer patients are often reluctant to travel far distances to obtain the necessary and appropriate care. One of the authors  (UBG) is currently setting up a pilot clinical trial to enable tele-oncology based initiatives to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our review paper highlights the major outstanding issues associated with gallbladder cancer. Due to the regional importance of this cancer within the state of New Mexico where both of us currently practice, we have sought to highlight the challenges surrounding gallbladder cancer in this review. There are currently far more questions than available answers surrounding this cancer. We are currently moving ahead with multiple initiatives (basic and clinical research) at our own institution (University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center) to make a dent in this rare, but deadly form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Complexity of Biological Systems: Deterministic vs Stochastic Modelling</title>

	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2018/06/26/complexity-of-biological-systems-deterministic-vs-stochastic-modelling.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rene te Boekhorst's journal club session where he discusses the complexity of biological systems and presents the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519305803431?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;A model of ion channel kinetics using deterministic chaotic rather than stochastic processes (Liebovitch and Toth, 1991)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Rene will highlight some issues concerning the modelling of biological processes. The conventional approach to capture the complexity of biological systems is to focus on their unpredictability and to explain this in terms probability theory, i.e. as stochastic processes. Time series analysis and Markov Chains are popular tools for stochastic modelling and Rene will cover a few fundamental methodological aspects and assumptions of both formalisms. Rene will pay special attention to some terminological confusion concerning the probability distributions underlying Markov models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time permits, Rene will compare the results of a stochastic approach with a deterministic view of complexity, illustrated with a rather “heretic” application of chaos theory to model ion-channel kinetics by Liebovitch and Toth (1991).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Do smoking bans lead to less or more smoking in the home?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10267</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/26/smoking-bans-lead-less-smoking-home/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoke-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of public smoking bans in enclosed spaces, it has been argued that this may lead to more smoking in the home and therefore to increased secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure of non-smoking family members and children. This ‘displacement hypothesis’ puts forward that a consequence of smoke-free legislation would be an increase in SHS-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative, the ‘social diffusion hypothesis’, supports that changes in social norms due to public smoking bans may result in an increase in voluntary home smoking bans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are particularly vulnerable to SHS as they are unable to protect themselves from exposure; an estimated 40–50% of children with smoking parents and/or other smoking household members are regularly exposed to SHS and therefore, the displacement hypothesis would have an especially deleterious effect on this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5679-z&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; to focus on children’s SHS exposure at home before and after the introduction of smoke-free legislations, based on conducting a meta-analysis of pooled relative risks, Sarah Nanning and colleagues at the University of Bremen, Germany, have looked at 15 studies which were published between 2007 and 2016. With the sample sizes ranging from 118 to 68,000 participants in the studies assessed, these all presented proportions of children (most aged between 5 and 15 years) exposed to SHS at home before and after the introduction of smoke-free legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study indicate that children’s SHS exposure at home did not increase after the introduction of public smoking bans. The comprehensive laws (those that require worksites, restaurants, and bars to be smoke-free) and mixed smoke-free laws (where there are regional differences in the type or extent of public smoking bans within a country or with an exceptional rule for certain types of hospitality venues such as small bars) yielded reductions of SHS exposure at home, whereby the effect was much greater in the group with mixed smoke-free laws. The authors therefore discredit the ‘social diffusion hypothesis’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10270&quot; style=&quot;width: 795px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10270 size-full&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/RRs.png&quot; width=&quot;785&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Forest plot summarizing the estimated relative risks of the included studies. Sarah Nanninga et. al. BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results  of the study must be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity between the publications assessed. Since only 15 articles were included in this analysis, additional studies are required to assess the impact of public smoking bans on children’s SHS exposure at home. Furthermore, as most of the studies had a short follow-up period, long-term studies on this topic using a greater variation of included countries are also required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are healthily deluded by memory biases that inflate our self-esteem. We remember more positive personal events than negative, for instance, and we selectively recall or even edit memories in a way that bolsters our favoured view of ourselves. A pair of psychologists at Lomonosov Moscow University propose that for people with persistent anxiety, this process goes awry. The worrier’s negative self-concept is instead reinforced by the selective recall of previous painful and awkward memories, harming their confidence and fuelling anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if it were possible to implant more positive autobiographical memories in these anxious individuals. This could boost their self-esteem, increase their confidence, thus dialling down their anxiety levels. In an intriguing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2017.1420195&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;, Veronika Nourkova and Darya Vaslienko have provided preliminary evidence that such an approach could work, although they found that hypnosis was required to make the memory implantation convincing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34087&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred and twenty adult volunteers completed a measure of their trait anxiety. Next, they recalled three episodes from their past that demonstrated aspects of themselves that fuel their anxiety (for instance, one man recalled a time he lost his temper after failing to land a job role; a woman recalled a childhood memory of being unable to recite a poem in front of her father and teachers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of the volunteers then attended more sessions during which they discussed with an interviewer how to modify these autobiographical memories to create false, edited versions in which they behaved in a more impressive way consistent with the kind of person they’d like to be. This was repeated weekly with a different memory targeted each session. Another group did the same but under hypnosis (of the Ericksonian conversational style). Yet another group went under hypnosis but listened to sounds of nature rather than editing their memories. A final control group didn’t edit their memories or go under hypnosis and simply spent the same time listening to sounds of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after these sessions ended, and again four months later, all the volunteers completed the trait anxiety measure again. They also described any changes in themselves that they experienced since taking part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group, and the group that created edited versions of their memories without hypnosis, both showed no changes in anxiety. The group that underwent hypnosis but performed no memory editing showed immediate reductions in anxiety but this didn’t last (if anything there was an unwelcome rebound to even higher anxiety). However, the group of volunteers who, under hypnosis, edited their memories to be more positive, enjoyed a significant reduction in anxiety at the four-month follow up. In their open-ended answers, they also described more experiences that suggested they had benefited from an increase in their self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the relevant memory-editing groups, the researchers tested how well the volunteers could distinguish between their real memories and the new, more positive versions. The group who created edited memories only through discussion could tell the difference quite easily, which suggests their falsely positive memories were not very plausible. In contrast, the group who edited memories under hypnosis found it difficult to tell the two apart, suggesting that the implantation of positive memories had been more successful and convincing. This might explain the apparent benefits they enjoyed to their self-esteem, which possibly contributed to increased confidence, thus explaining their lower anxiety at the later follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said they had “demonstrated that the intensification of positive construction [of false self-defining memories] may decrease trait anxiety in the long term by affecting the autobiographical knowledge base and thereby the working self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest it may be possible to exploit the known malleability of memory to edit people’s very sense of self, to make it more positive and closer to the kind of person they would like to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings should be considered preliminary and the explanation for the effects is quite speculative. There was no direct measure of self-esteem, for instance, and while the participants’ initial average levels of anxiety were on the cusp of being considered clinically significant, this was not a clinical sample with diagnosed anxiety problems. The very idea of therapists deliberately implanting false memories in people, even if they are positive, also raises obvious ethical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: The 5 Second Rule: Task Initiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23746</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/25/the-5-second-rule-task-initiation/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The title—&lt;i&gt;The 5 Second Rule: Transform Your Life, Work, and Confidence with Everyday Courage&lt;/i&gt;—intrigued me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the publisher&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;Mel Robbins’s self-help book is &lt;i&gt;“&lt;/i&gt;based on a simple psychological tool that the author developed to motivate herself. Using a technique that involves counting down backwards from five to one, she gave herself the extra push she needed to complete dreaded tasks, become more productive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this technique help solve my task-initiation problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a brain injury survivor. I have clusters of thin-walled blood vessels in my brain. Two of them bled. To prevent additional bleeds, I underwent brain surgeries, which left me with a number of challenging symptoms, including difficulties initiating tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though similar to procrastination in its end result, brain injury-related issues with task initiation feel very different. I am fully aware when I procrastinate, and I often laugh at myself in the process. When I procrastinate, I make conscious choices. Instead of working on the annual report, I choose to do the laundry, edit an essay, or take my dog for a walk. And when I run out of excuses or get too close to the deadline, I get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trouble initiating tasks is more akin to the difficulty of shifting to a new undertaking after completing a long and involved project, when it feels almost impossible to switch to the next activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually have no idea that I’m having trouble initiating a task. I know with absolute certainty that I will get to the task—just not right now. In my mind, starting isn’t an issue, because this internal conviction that “of course I’ll do it” is so strong. It’s as if there’s a disconnect between the belief that I’ll do the task and the cognitive action required to actually initiate it. I’m not choosing to distract myself, and I’m not trying to postpone the inevitable. There’s simply no conscious awareness and no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding the challenge is that brain injury-related task initiation problems don’t follow any recognizable pattern. They arise without warning and are frequently unrelated to the nature of the task, interfering equally with tasks I enjoy and those I’d rather avoid. They can last anywhere from several days to several years. They often end abruptly, for no apparent reason. When my brain releases me, I’m off and running, all signs of struggle gone, as if the problem never existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat my difficulties beginning an activity, my neuropsychologist suggested I keep a daily list and block off chunks of time in my calendar to work on those tasks. Fortunately, my brain injury brought on a level of rigidity—once an item is on that list, I feel compelled to address it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, identifying problematic tasks to include on the list is not straightforward, because the same “I know I’ll get to it” belief means there’s no problem, and it doesn’t occur to me that it belongs on the list. And I sometimes can’t initiate writing the list—I know I’ll write it, just not right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d recently been having trouble beginning a new essay on a topic I wanted to explore. It had been simmering in my mind for a while, and I felt ready to begin writing. But I couldn’t. I tried tricking my brain into cooperating by breaking the task into smaller and hopefully more manageable chunks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to sit down in front of my computer, but my brain refused to attempt the next task. Later, I managed to open a new file, but my mind wouldn’t move beyond that chunk. I left the file open, knowing I’d get to it (just not now). A few days later, I typed a title, but couldn’t start the body of the essay. I knew exactly how I wanted it to begin. The words were there. But &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galvanized into action by Robbins’ five second rule, I was determined to try it the next morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I finished getting dressed, I thought about working on the essay. “5-4-3-2-1” and there I was, at my computer, tapping away, the essay taking form just as I’d imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time my inner voice suggested I needed to take a breather, before I had time to question my motive, I applied the five second rule. “5-4-3-2-1” and I was back on track. After finishing a first draft, I wondered about working on another troublesome essay. Five seconds later, I was back at the keyboard. Feeling like I was on a roll and afraid that I’d fall prey to my damaged brain if I paused, I moved on to sending email queries about speaking engagements and book events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problematic item that came to mind gave me pause—I needed to grade a pile of essays. This time, the five second rule failed, because common sense kicked in. I had reached my limit—fatigue overwhelmed me and my brain blanked out. I absolutely had to rest, or I’d be in no shape to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came away from that day feeling good about myself. I’d been more productive than I’d been in a long time. But I was also exhausted. Applying the five second rule had thoroughly drained me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since realized that the five second rule doesn’t work for me exactly the way Mel Robbins explained it. I haven’t abandoned it, but as with so many other things post-injury, I am learning to adapt it to my particular circumstances. I have to pace myself, and as soon as I recognize the early signs of fatigue, I use the rule to take a nap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five second rule rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been lost in a daydream for as long as I can remember….These daydreams tend to be stories…for which I feel real emotion, usually happiness or sadness, which have the ability to make me laugh and cry…They’re as important a part of my life as anything else; I can spend hours alone with my daydreams….I am careful to control my actions in public so it is not evident that my mind is constantly spinning these stories and I am constantly lost in them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-year-old woman who emailed these reflections to Eli Somer at the University of Haifa, Israel, diagnosed herself with Maladaptive Daydreaming, sometimes known as Daydreaming Disorder. While Maladaptive Daydreaming is not included in standard mental health diagnostic manuals, there are cyber-communities dedicated to it, and “in recent years it has gradually become evident that daydreaming can evolve into an extreme and maladaptive behaviour, up to the point where it turns into a clinically significant condition,” write Somer and Nirit Soffer-Dudek at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; on the disorder, published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34091&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is, they say, the first to explore the mental health factors that accompany Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) over time – and it provides insights into not only what might cause these intense, vivid, extended bouts of daydreaming but also hints at how to prevent them, or how to stop them in their tracks. Because while many people who experience MD report enjoying their daydreams at the time, MD can also negatively affect their relationships with others, their day-to-day lives, and their overall emotional wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work led researchers to suggest that MD might be either a dissociative disorder, a disturbance of attention, a behavioural addiction or an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new online study, Somer and Soffer-Dudek recruited 77 self-diagnosed sufferers of MD, from 26 different countries, ranging in age from 18-60. Just over 80 per cent were women (possibly because women seem to be more affected by MD than men, the researchers write).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants first provided details about any mental health diagnoses (21 had been diagnosed with depression, 14 with anxiety disorders and 5 with OCD, among other disorders). Then, each evening before bed, for 14 days, they completed a series of questionnaires that asked about their experiences that day. These scales assessed levels of dissociation, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and emotion – and also maladaptive day dreaming. (Participants were asked to report on the extent to which statements such as “I felt the need or urge to continue a daydream that was interrupted by a real-world event at a later point” had applied to them that day.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported spending four hours a day daydreaming. On days on which their MD was more intense and time-consuming, they also experienced higher levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation and negative emotion, and both types of anxiety. But only obsessive-compulsive symptoms consistently predicted the intensity and duration of maladaptive daydreaming on the next day, regardless of the levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms on that following day.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these findings, the researchers note that only five of the participants had actually been diagnosed with OCD –  “This discrepancy suggests that obsessive-compulsive symptoms and MD share common mechanisms and interact with each other…but MD does not seem to be merely a subtype of OCD.” However, they added that many people with MD describe being consistently drawn to their daydreaming in a compulsive way. “The finding that a surge in obsessive-compulsive symptoms precedes MD [also] points to a key role of this construct as a contributing mechanism,” Somer and Soffer-Dudek argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compulsions to daydream, or to carry on daydreaming even after many hours have passed, might be addressed using cognitive behavioural approaches developed to address other compulsions, the researchers suggest. They also speculate that low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin may play a role in MD, as in OCD. If future work confirms this, drugs that modify serotonin levels may possibly be used in treatment.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some limitations of the study – in particular, that it was based entirely on self-reports. But as research on MD is scarce, and this is thought to be the first longitudinal exploration of the disorder, the results should at least help to inform future work in this area. Though it’s also possible that not all people with MD will want treatment. As the woman with MD who emailed Somer also wrote: “I am torn between the love of my daydreams and the desire to be normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Website-Image-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many birdwatchers know, the best way to see an impressive number of avian species is to take a trip to the Southern Hemisphere. En route &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahstrycker.com/books/birding-without-borders/&quot;&gt;to encountering a record-setting 6,042 bird species in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, intrepid birdwatcher Noah Strycker spent three full months in South America (sometimes referred to as the Bird Continent), but only twelve days in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that European birds are any less interesting than those found at more southerly latitudes; it simply reflects the strikingly uneven global distribution of the world’s 11,000 living bird species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many major groups of birds are entirely restricted to South America, Africa, and Australasia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are species numbers higher in the Southern Hemisphere, but many major groups of birds are entirely restricted to South America, Africa, and Australasia – all vestiges of the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did this uneven geographic distribution of living bird diversity arise? Does it simply reflect the fact that most groups of living birds arose on the southern continents, and failed to disperse elsewhere? Or have more complex patterns governed the evolutionary history of avian geographic distributions through geological time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10291&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10291&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/34899743383_d94c503c01_z-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Knysna Turaco (Tauraco corythaix) Wilderness, Western Cape, South Africa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Daniel J. Field&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to definitively answer this question is to flesh out the fossil record of modern birds. In our new study, just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;, we examined a beautifully preserved 52-million-year-old fossil bird named &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt;. Originally discovered in western North America in the 1980’s, and named in the 1990’s, &lt;em&gt;F. panarium &lt;/em&gt;exhibits an enigmatic mix of anatomical features that has prevented a robust assessment of its affinities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By re-examining its anatomical features in an updated evolutionary context, our work supports &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt; as the earliest known relative of a group of living birds called turacos, or “banana eaters”. Turacos are an outrageously beautiful group of ~24 species of medium-sized fruit-eating birds, and the feathers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/sets/72157686118399406&quot;&gt;several species contain unique pigments&lt;/a&gt; that generate bright green and magenta tones. In addition to these interesting aesthetic attributes, modern turacos are also known for being entirely restricted to sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the fossil, &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt;, hails from North America, what does that tell us about the ancient geographic distribution of the group that gave rise to modern turacos? And how did modern turacos become restricted to Africa in the modern day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt; is far from the first example of a fossil bird being found outside the modern distribution of its closest living relatives. Many other groups of birds that today are restricted to southern landmasses, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/sets/72157684444609383&quot;&gt;seriemas&lt;/a&gt; of South America , or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/albums/72157687089869025&quot;&gt;mousebirds&lt;/a&gt; of Africa, have fossil representatives known from entirely different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10292&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10292&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/19835422463_87049f5623_z-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus), Nairobi National Park, Kenya&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Daniel J. Field&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper reaffirms the complexity such observations can introduce into analyses focused on discerning ancestral geographic distributions of modern birds (please see refs &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/11/e1501005&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/11/e1501005&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12969&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). While our analyses examining only modern birds confidently infer that the most recent common ancestor of all living birds arose in the Southern Hemisphere, our analyses which incorporate fossils return a decidedly less certain result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These analyses tell us that either modern birds did not arise in the Southern Hemisphere, or, if they did, that subsequent fluctuations in the geographic distributions of modern birds have been vastly more complex than we could understand without the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work will attempt to more clearly discern the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12549-011-0062-4&quot;&gt;major factors&lt;/a&gt; driving the dramatic shifts in geographic range documented by the fossil record. Are these ancient episodes of inferred dispersal related to periods of climatic change throughout Earth history? Or were they perhaps related to periodic extinction events throughout geological time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the implications for understanding the geographic history of the lineage including turacos, &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt; sheds additional light on the age of the turaco lineage itself. The age of the fossil makes &lt;em&gt;F. panarium &lt;/em&gt;not only the oldest-known representative of the turaco lineage, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697&quot;&gt;oldest representative&lt;/a&gt; of the major group that includes turacos, cuckoos, and bustards (which are large, ground-dwelling birds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, turacos must have diverged from their closest living relatives by at least 52 million years ago, which may suggest that this group was part of a rapid avian radiation in the aftermath of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, 66 million years ago (that famously wiped out the giant dinosaurs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many living birds that are strictly tree-dwelling have relatively short hindlimbs, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/287/1019/131&quot;&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; that lowers their centre of mass for enhanced perching stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt; also provides interesting insights into the evolution of modern turaco biology. Many living birds that are strictly tree-dwelling have relatively short hindlimbs, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/287/1019/131&quot;&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; that lowers their centre of mass for enhanced perching stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the case for living turacos, which are both tree-dwelling and exhibit relatively short hindlimbs. However, the hindlimbs of &lt;em&gt;F. panarium&lt;/em&gt; are quite long, similar to living ground-dwelling birds. This observation may point to the relatively late acquisition of arboreality among the ancestors of turacos—consistent with the idea that a tree-dwelling lifestyle arose independently &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/how-birds-survived-the-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-97021&quot;&gt;numerous times among living birds&lt;/a&gt; following the forest-destroying end-Cretaceous extinction event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multifaceted insights yielded by &lt;em&gt;Foro panarium&lt;/em&gt; illustrate the profound importance of the fossil record for accurately understanding the evolutionary history of modern birds. Clearly, a better understanding of the evolutionary affinities of modern bird fossils has the potential to radically improve our understanding of how and when modern birds, and their characteristic geographic distributions, evolved. Our picture of bird evolutionary history will continue to grow sharper as each new bird fossil gets unearthed … not unlike adjusting the focus on a distant turaco through binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Do scientists have a responsibility to make their work accessible to the public?



&quot;Public Engagement&quot;, broadly speaking, means scientists communicating about science to non-scientists. Blogs are a form of public engagement, as are (non-academic) books. Holding public talks or giving interviews would also count as such.



Recently, it has become fashionable to say that it is important for scientists to engage the public, and that this engagement should be encouraged. I agree completely</description>

It will not be about neurological or psychiatric diseases, the typical topics for this blog. It will be about oncology, for very personal reasons: misery, frustration, and grief. After seven months of research on immunotherapy clinical trials, I couldn't find a single &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[acceptable]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; one&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in either Canada or the US that would enroll my partner with stage 4 cancer. For arbitrary reasons, for financial reasons, because it's not the “right” kind of cancer, because the tumor's too rare, because it's too common, because of unlisted exclusionary criteria, because one trial will not accept the genomic testing done for another trial.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because of endless waiting and bureaucracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, I'll let NIH explain a few terms. Is precision medicine the same as personalized medicine? Yes and no.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how  genes affect a person’s response to particular drugs. This relatively  new field combines pharmacology (the science of drugs) and genomics (the  study of genes and their functions) to develop &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;effective, safe  medications and doses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;  that are tailored to variations in a person’s  genes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At present, precision pharmacogenomics is just a “tumor grab” with no promise of treatment in most cases. There are some serious and admirable efforts, but accessibility and costs are major barriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cancer?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/oncology?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#oncology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/genomics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#genomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of January 18, 2018... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4KWpuA3yVh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4KWpuA3yVh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/953900950002982913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we've been promised such a utopia for quite a while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personalized medicine in oncology: the future is now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; (Schilsky, 2010):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cancer chemotherapy is in evolution from non-specific cytotoxic drugs  that damage both tumour and normal cells to more specific agents and  immunotherapy approaches. Targeted agents are directed at unique  molecular features of cancer cells, and immunotherapeutics modulate the  tumour immune response; both approaches aim to produce greater  effectiveness with less toxicity. The development and use of such agents  in biomarker-defined populations enables a more personalized approach  to cancer treatment than previously possible and has the potential to  reduce the cost of cancer care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zloTUBn8L04/Wy85lgcfi3I/AAAAAAAAMkg/Xl5Bs9JiUd8i-bJQD3n0m_P7HS9OJmK5gCLcBGAs/s1600/Schilsky%2B%25282010%2529%2B-%2Bknowledge%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bmolecular%2Bprofile%2Bblah%2Bblah%2Bblah.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;147&quot; data-original-width=&quot;361&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zloTUBn8L04/Wy85lgcfi3I/AAAAAAAAMkg/Xl5Bs9JiUd8i-bJQD3n0m_P7HS9OJmK5gCLcBGAs/s320/Schilsky%2B%25282010%2529%2B-%2Bknowledge%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bmolecular%2Bprofile%2Bblah%2Bblah%2Bblah.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schilsky (2010)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT'S 2018, WHERE IS THAT FUTURE YOU PROMISED US?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, let's go back further, to 1999:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/4/5/426.long&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Era of Personalized Medicine &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Targeting Drugs For Each Unique Genetic Profile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, there are success stories for specific types of cancer (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;trastuzumab&quot;&gt;Herceptin&lt;/a&gt;).

But if there's a 25% chance or even a 10% chance it'll extend the life of your loved one, you'll go to great lengths to try to acquire it, one way or another.

This may rarely lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of eyes) and be severe or life threatening &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;abnormal function of your thyroid gland which cause changes in hormonal levels. A decrease in thyroid function as seen on blood tests may cause you to feel tired, cold or gain weight while an increase in thyroid function may cause you to feel shaky, have a fast pulse or lose weight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling of arms and/or legs (fluid retention) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in the level of body salts as seen on blood tests.

It could be serious and/or life threatening. May occur more frequently if you are receiving radiation treatment to your chest or if you are Japanese. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious bleeding events leading to death may occur in patients with head and neck tumors.

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: Seven common-sense building blocks for your child’s brain.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5561</guid>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/seven-common-sense-building-blocks-for-your-childs-brain/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-5563 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;655&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dandelion-761104_1920-1024x655.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children differ in their biological susceptibility to life experiences in a ‘for better and for worse’ manner. Some kids are particularly sensitive to both highly stressful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; highly nurturing environments. Like orchids, such children bloom if lovingly cultivated, but wilt and wither if neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, adaptable resilient children who don’t get easily stressed are like little dandelions, they’ll grow and thrive anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883141&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; are now showing ‘orchid’ and ‘dandelion’ genes linked to particular enzymes or brain chemical receptors, if and only if combined with early childhood toxic stress, can trigger behavioural problems and mood disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible we’ve underestimated the importance of childhood.” Professor Richie Poulton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulton is head of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dunedin Study&lt;/a&gt;, a research programme that has closely tracked every aspect of the lives of 1037 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972 and 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dunedin study has shown that early life experiences shape developing brain architecture and strongly affect whether children grow up to be healthy, productive members of society. Toxic stress — defined as stress that is extreme or long-lasting or occurs outside an environment of supportive, attached caregiver relationships — derails healthy brain development, with damaging effects on learning, behaviour, and physical and mental health across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing The Women’s Brain Book I spent much of Chapter 2 exploring what can go wrong during childhood – from the effects of trauma to family stress to learning negative gender stereotypes. I worried that if readers had young children they were probably ready to drop the book and run off to bulk-buy cotton wool and bubble wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we know about normal and abnormal brain development, what experiences do infants and children (the dandelions and the orchids) need to thrive, not just survive? What can adults who raise children do to foster healthy, happy brains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with wading through decades of childhood development literature, I instead picked up the phone and called my friend and colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://drkristygoodwin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr Kristy Goodwin&lt;/a&gt;. Goodwin is a children’s learning and development researcher and she has &lt;a href=&quot;https://drkristygoodwin.com/book/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;summarised&lt;/a&gt; seven essential experiences or, as she calls them ‘building blocks’ for optimal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do growing brains need to thrive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Attachments and relationships.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm, predictable and loving relationships allow children to feel secure, safe and unstressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Language.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants and young children need ample opportunities to hear and use language: ‘serve-and-return’ interactions are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Sleep.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is vital for children’s emotional, physical and mental development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Play.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through play, babies and children develop cognitive skills, creativity and emotional regulation. They need ample opportunities to experiment and explore, including time outdoors in nature. Dr Goodwin highlights the modern-day need to counteract ‘screen time’ with ‘green time’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Physical Movement.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children need to master simple then complex motor skills in order to develop more sophisticated, higher-order thinking skills later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Nutrition.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality nutrition is vital for optimal development. Children’s diets need to be rich in foods that contain essential fatty acids optimal for brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Executive Function Skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children need to master simple higher-order thinking skills such as impulse control and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that we know experience accounts for about 70%  of a child’s development. It’s critical that we provide them with the right types of experiences.” Dr Kristy Goodwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poulton, Goodwin and I agree that childhood is a sacred time. It’s a unique period in the lifespan that needs to be treasured, nurtured and protected.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>In research on people, scientists are typically interested in the group data - the mean, median, and variance of a sample of people. But according to a provocative new paper out in PNAS, the statistics of a group can obscure the variability within individuals, over time.





The paper, from Aaron J. Fisher, John D. Medaglia, and Bertus F. Jeronimus, isn't really making a new point. The pitfalls of generalizing from the group to the individual level have long been known - but these issues</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Celebrating Pride while recognizing the mental health challenges of the LGBTQ community</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Pride Parade&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/gay-pride-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I decided to write this blog, my hope was to write something uplifting since Pride month is a time of celebration.  I was determined to find recently published articles on the advancements in LGBTQ health. After looking through all pertinent journals from BMC’s 185 journals on medicine and public health, my results were disappointing. All of the articles I found on LGBTQ health painted a dismal picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles I found addressed either LGBTQ health disparities or the challenges in obtaining health care. Article after article discussed how LGBTQ individuals experience greater rates of mental health issues compared to their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that we know what these health issues are, where they are found, and their etiological underpinnings. As I proceeded with my research, it became clear that the poor mental health amongst LGBTQ individuals could be attributed to stigma, three types in particular: enacted stigma, felt stigma, and internalized stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a 34.9% lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation amongst MSM. This rate increases to 42.6% when looking at populations from high income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enacted stigma includes overt behaviors of prejudice and victimization.  Felt stigma involves the psychological impact of rejection as well as concealing one’s sexual orientation. Internalized stigma, or internalized homophobia, involves LGBTQ individuals having negative feelings towards homosexuality and their own sexual orientation. One study conducted in Germany found that all three forms of stigma were &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1435-7&quot;&gt;positively correlated with mental health issues.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there have been recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7998/4c4c55269fb42882379aca0e7b0ec50a10c2.pdf&quot;&gt;advances in LGBTQ rights and acceptance&lt;/a&gt; within the Western world. However, these advances are absent in other parts of the world such as China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that rates of internalized stigma are higher in men who have sex with men (MSM) in China than in other countries. It was also found that amongst Chinese MSM, higher rates of internalized homophobia are associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-017-0530-1&quot;&gt;higher rates of psychological distress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the subsequent effects from mental health issues that the LGBTQ group faces, suicide is the biggest concern. In Canada, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2014.946887?scroll=top&amp;amp;needAccess=true&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; is the number one cause of premature mortality amongst MSM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1575-9&quot;&gt;One meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that there is a 34.9% lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation amongst MSM. This rate increases to 42.6% when looking at populations from high income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did sexual minority women experience worse mental health compared to their exclusively heterosexual counterparts, but they also experienced greater rates of interpersonal violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSM are not the only LGBTQ population that experience poor mental health. This pattern also occurs in sexual minority women. These findings primarily come by comparing exclusively heterosexual women to sexual minority women. Unfortunately there are few studies examining subsets of sexual minority women, which include mainly heterosexuals, bisexuals, and lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12905-017-0452-5&quot;&gt;In an Australian study&lt;/a&gt; not only did sexual minority women experience worse mental health compared to their exclusively heterosexual counterparts, but they also experienced greater rates of interpersonal violence. Of further concern, bisexual women have the highest levels of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depression while simultaneously having the lowest levels of mental health and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual and gender minorities from certain populations are also found to experience greater rates of mental health conditions. Sex workers experience high rates of violence and sexual health vulnerabilities, however research on mental health in this population is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0491-y&quot;&gt;A study of sex workers in Canada&lt;/a&gt; found that 49% of sex workers are diagnosed with mental health conditions. When researchers delved further into the data they found that identifying as a sexual and/or gender minority was a significant predictor of obtaining a mental health diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10279&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10279 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/PFLAG-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesibans and Gays)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;CreativeCommons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride is unique because it is a time to celebrate love and acceptance; a time when literally all the colors of the rainbow permeate the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, this is a reprieve from the day-to-day challenges that many LGBTQ individuals experience. It is a way to provide support and encouragement to these people who are in such desperate need of support and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot ignore the dangers that this community faces throughout the world and how stigma can result in millions of people experiencing poor mental health, psychiatric illness, suicidal ideation, and even death by suicide, but by rallying during Pride, LGBTQ individuals have an opportunity to not only embrace their true selves but also fight to protect themselves and others from the challenges they inevitably face throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Little world, big problems: unravelling the origin of slave-raiding in ants</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/22/little-world-big-problems-unravelling-the-origin-of-slave-raiding-in-ants/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Formica.sanguinea6.-.lindsey-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody can deny the fascination arising from the complexity of the social architecture which defines the life of the anthill, and the slave-raiding behaviour of some species of &lt;em&gt;Formica &lt;/em&gt;outstands as a spectacular case of social parasitism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary pathway towards slavery has been intriguing generations of natural scientists, and gave life to a discussion which finds its roots in Charles Darwin ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species&quot;&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;’ itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father of the theory of evolution suggested that slave-raiding in the genus &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt; evolved progressively, through an intermediary step of so-called ‘temporary parasitism’. This hypothesis is sustained by several modern researchers, but other scientists propose an alternative explanation, suggesting that parasitic colony founding evolved several times independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unravel the nodes of a 150-years old debate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Romiguier&quot;&gt;Jonathan Romiguier&lt;/a&gt;, with a group of researchers from the University of Lausanne, Montpellier, British Columbia and Helsinki, took advantage of a modern phylogenomic approach to finally solve the intricate relationship among paleartic &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt; subgenera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mixed experimental and bioinformatics methodology, Romiguier and his colleagues generated a phylogenetic tree to reconstruct the evolutionary steps of the four &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt; subgenera differentiation. Following the clades of their phylogenetic tree, we can retrace the history of paleartic &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt;, highlighting the key moments of the journey from freedom to slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10273&quot; style=&quot;width: 788px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10273&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/12862_2018_1159_Fig1_HTML.gif&quot; width=&quot;778&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Molecular phylogeny of &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Taken from manuscript&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the basal position of the tree, we find the free living &lt;em&gt;Serviformica&lt;/em&gt;, the only group which is able to form colonies independently, indicating that &lt;em&gt;Formica &lt;/em&gt;genus shares a free living ancestor with independent colony founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the tree, and therefore the evolution of &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt;, we can find a single clade grouping the remaining subgenera, &lt;em&gt;Coptoformica&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Formica s. str.&lt;/em&gt; and the slave-making &lt;em&gt;Raptiformica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all share some fundamental traits, such as the loss of the ability of independently found new colonies and temporary parasitic colony founding, suggesting that they can be considered quite close relatives, sharing a common ancestor that started to parasitize the &lt;em&gt;Serviformica &lt;/em&gt;nests, and which passed on this capability to all of the three groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coptoformica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Formica s. str.&lt;/em&gt;, also known as ‘wood ants’, however, rely on mechanisms other than slavery to start new colonies. They normally perform ‘budding’, a process where new queens and workers leave to start a new colony nearby. This behaviour leads to the creation of super colonies of many inter-connected nests, and it is thought to be an adaptation to cold habitats, where the success of independent colony founding is limited by high queen mortality. In this context, intra-specific brood transport among nests is often observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood ants can use so-called ‘temporary parasitism’; in this case, new queens enter the nest of a &lt;em&gt;Serviformica&lt;/em&gt; species, expelling and replacing the original queen, and use the host workers as helpers. With time, host workers are gradually replaced by the daughters of the temporary parasite queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;em&gt;Raptiformica&lt;/em&gt; developed the unique feature of active slave-making, alongside temporary parasitism. This is perpetrated as seasonal, inter-specific brood robbing from &lt;em&gt;Serviformica&lt;/em&gt; nests to increase worker force. After emerging, &lt;em&gt;Serviformica&lt;/em&gt; workers behave as if they were in their own colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, the brood exchange typical of wood ants could have evolved toward selfish brood robbing during territorial battles, to ultimately become the inter-specific slave-raiding observed in &lt;em&gt;Raptiformica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolving the deepest nodes of &lt;em&gt;Formica&lt;/em&gt; relationships led to the formulation of a theory that confirms Darwin first hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branching order of phylogeny suggests the evolutionary pathway towards slavery had a single origin, which then developed in several steps, where temporary parasitism can be seen as an intermediary step between free-living hosts and slave-maker parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of our evolutionary journey, we can look at the phylogenetic tree of Romiguier as a solid backbone in support of the classic model described in ‘On the Origin of the Species’, which adds a dowel to the global puzzle of evolution of slave-making in ants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working an emotionally-demanding job can leave you frazzled by alienation, exhaustion, and confusion about whether you are doing any good. Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists live their day-to-day at the interface of their clients’ most difficult emotions and recollections, so it is no surprise that burnout is a leading cause of problems for those in the profession. To better understand the risk factors that contribute to therapist burnout, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22615?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new review article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/i&gt; has examined findings from 30 years of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34082&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabrielle Simionato and Susan Simpson of the University of South Australia gathered 40 articles in English on the topic, involving a total of almost 9,000 psychotherapists. On average, participants expressed a low to moderate degree of occupational stress, with just over half of those canvassed reporting moderate to high burnout. Burnout is often broken into three elements, and of these, the one most prevalent for therapists was emotional exhaustion – feeling physical and emotional fatigue while at work. Also prevalent to a lesser degree were the other two aspects: depersonalisation and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of factors correlated with burnout, although as the studies were overwhelmingly cross-sectional we have to take care about assigning causality.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout rates were higher in psychologists who were less experienced, and also in those with less subjective confidence in their professional ability. Several studies showed a lack of social support in or outside the workplace was associated with burnout. However, other studies showed that frequent discussion of work frustration with others was itself associated with higher burnout. This could simply be because therapists on the brink of overload are more likely to vent. Alternatively, there could be a reverse causality – other research has suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/23/workplace-venting-makes-it-harder-to-bounce-back-from-bad-experiences/&quot;&gt;venting can impede recovery&lt;/a&gt; from stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the evidence was contradictory: for example more burnout was identified in women in five studies, but more in men in another three, with no association with gender found in a further six, resulting in no clear message for gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review flagged a number of protective strategies and behaviours, including the value of effective personal boundaries in order to maintain some emotional separation from clients’ problems. Another observation was that therapists experiencing more burnout tended not to use humour, or only in a self-defeating way, although again this could be a consequence of burnout rather than a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality traits are reasonably stable so their association with burnout is more likely to be causal. As in previous research, perfectionism was linked to burnout, as was neuroticism, likely due to a heightened sensitivity to negative events. Less agreeable and less extraverted psychotherapists tended to report burnout; the authors suggest this may be because such individuals tend to have weaker social support networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, Simionato and Simpson make some specific recommendations for ways of approaching work that may be useful: maintaining boundaries, seeking support, staying in touch with humour. There is also some general evidence that mindfulness may be an effective route to reducing rumination and unrealistic expectations. Supervisors should consider that therapists who muster confidence in their abilities are likely to ward off emotional overload, and therefore ensure that their charges’ successes are recognised and their struggles put in context. The likely influence of personality factors reinforces the need for people to be holistically suited to the particular challenges of a job role. A therapist seeking to work in a highly challenging position, due to the nature of clients or the operating environment, should be both technically qualified and temperamentally suited, or else they may pay the price over time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Psychology’s favourite moral thought experiment doesn’t predict real-world behaviour</title>

&lt;p&gt;Would you wilfully hurt or kill one person so as to save multiple others? That’s the dilemma at the heart of moral psychology’s favourite thought experiment and its derivatives. In the classic case, you must decide whether or not to pull a lever to divert a runaway mining trolley so that it avoids killing five people and instead kills a single individual on another line. A popular theory in the field states that, to many of us, so abhorrent is the notion of deliberately harming someone that our “deontological” instincts deter us from pulling the lever; on the other hand, the more we intellectualise the problem with cool detachment, the more likely we will make a utilitarian or consequentialist judgment and divert the trolley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with thought experiments of this kind, psychologists have examined all manner of individual and circumstantial factors that influence the likelihood of people making  deontological vs. utilitarian moral decisions. However, there’s a fatal (excuse the pun) problem. A striking &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617752640&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science &lt;/em&gt;finds that our answers to the thought experiments don’t match up with our real-world moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34043&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dries Bostyn and his colleagues at Ghent University recruited nearly 300 participants. All answered several hypothetical moral dilemmas derived from the classic trolley dilemma – for instance, in a building on fire, they had to say whether they would push a man through a locked window to his death in order to make an exit for the five children trapped inside. The participants also completed several questionnaires tapping psychological factors, such as psychopathy and “need for cognition”, previously identified as being associated with being more utilitarian in one’s moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fortnight later, just under 200 of the participants were invited to the psych lab, one at a time, to take part in a real-life moral dilemma involving live mice. The participants saw two cages – one housing one mouse, the other housing five – each wired to an electroshock machine. They were told that in 20 seconds, if they did nothing, the machine would deliver a very painful but nonlethal shock to the cage containing five mice. However, if the participants pressed a button in front of them, they could divert the electric shock to the cage containing one mouse, thus saving the other five from pain (in actuality this was an illusion and all participants were later informed that in fact no mice were shocked or harmed in the study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining participants went to the psych lab but performed a hypothetical version of the mouse decision. They heard a description of the same two-cage set up faced by the others and they had to say whether they would press the button or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants who performed the real-life mouse task behaved differently than those who made a purely hypothetical decision – they were less than half as likely to let the five mice get shocked (16 per cent of them left the button unpressed compared with 34 per cent of the hypothetical group). In other words, faced with a real-life dilemma, the volunteers were more consequentialist / utilitarian; that is, more willing to inflict harm for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most important finding – at least for the validity of moral psychology which so often relies on thought experiments – is that the participants’ preference for deontological vs. utilitarian responding in their answers to the earlier battery of 10 hypothetical moral dilemmas bore no relation to their decision in the real-life mouse task (in contrast, the decisions of participants in the hypothetical mouse group were related to their answers to the earlier moral dilemmas). What is more, none of the psychological factors, such as psychopathy or need for cognition, were related to decision-making in the real-life moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so long, moral psychology has relied on the notion that you can extrapolate from people’s decisions in hypothetical thought experiments to infer something meaningful about how they would behave morally in the real world. These new findings challenge that core assumption of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say people’s hypothetical decisions are meaningless. Although participants’ responses to the earlier moral thought experiments did not predict their later real moral decisions (i.e. whether or not to press the button to divert the electric charge), they were not totally unrelated. Among those who pressed the button in the real-life task, if they’d also earlier shown a preference for utilitarian decisions in the thought experiments then they tended to press the button more quickly; they also expressed less doubt and discomfort about their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obvious criticism of this research is that the trolley problem and its derivatives involve humans, whereas the real-life moral dilemma used in this study involved mice. However, the researchers believe this is not a critical issue since the moral conflicts (deliberately harming the few to save the many) are the same in both cases. They also note that they used a questionnaire to measure their participants’ levels of empathy for animals, and how participants scored made no difference to the pattern of findings (meaning its unlikely that participants’ levels of concern or not for the mice explains the results).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bostyn and his team don’t know why people’s judgments on the moral thought experiments didn’t predict their choice in the real-life moral task. Current theory – based on the idea that emotional responding leads to more deontological decisions and rational thinking to more utilitarian decisions – isn’t much help because it would actually predict more deontological decisions in the more vivid and emotive real-life task, which is the opposite of what was found. The researchers speculate that perhaps people are more inclined to virtue-signal when answering in the hypothetical (i.e. signalling that they couldn’t possibly choose to deliberately harm another, even to save the majority), but one could just as easily make this case for the very opposite results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future research will have to investigate these and other possibilities,” the researchers concluded. “… [W]e advance the argument that we will be able to bridge the gap between moral judgment and moral behaviour only by exploring new research paradigms that bring more decision making into the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sam Sutton's journal club session where he discusses the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291952&quot;&gt;Signal Propagation and Logic Gating in Networks of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons (Vogels and Abbott, 2005)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate
across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Are Dyslexics More Entrepreneurial?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23742</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/20/are-dyslexics-more-entrepreneurial/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is rather common: it is estimated that around 5-10% of individuals are dyslexic. Despite an apparent disability, some are famous, like Tom Cruise or Richard Branson. Obviously, they do not suffer from a lack of intelligence and are, in fact, quite successful in the business world. So what is going on in their brains? Are they developing some compensatory mechanisms that help them to do things better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological research studies indicate that dyslexics develop coping strategies to compensate for their weaknesses, which helps them in later life. The resilience that they acquire while in school often helps them to be more successful in developing a business, in being an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics show that there are twice more dyslexics among entrepreneurs when compared to the general population. However, dyslexics are uncommon in higher management. They also tend to have a different business management style. Thus, they do better in startups and are better at handling particular types of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is usually first identified when a child goes to school and struggles with scrambled text. Dyslexic children have difficulty in reading texts, interpreting them, and explaining the meaning of the text to others, even though they can be very intelligent otherwise. Dyslexia often results in poor academic performance, undue pressure, and psychological trauma. Each dyslexic child needs to learn to cope with these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although dyslexic children are as intelligent as their peers at school, they are often labeled as less capable. Children with dyslexia are often targets of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/03/school-bullying-forgive-ignore-or-revenge/&quot;&gt;bullying in school&lt;/a&gt;. Poor self-image at school often leads to worsening of self-esteem in many of these kids. As helping dyslexic children is not easy, they are often left to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s going on in the dyslexic brain? Neurological basis of dyslexia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a common disorder, dyslexia is the subject of multiple studies. Researchers agree that those living with dyslexia may have differences in the brain relative to non-dyslexic children, and these differences are the subject of intense clinical research. The recent explosion in brain imaging technology is helping us gain a deeper understanding of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurological theory of dyslexia is one of the earliest. The theory was proposed about a century ago when British physicians Morgan and Hinshelwood described dyslexia as a “visual word blindness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of adults &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/14/living-with-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;living with brain trauma&lt;/a&gt; in the left parietal region demonstrated that many of these people develop reading difficulties. They find it challenging to process the optical image of letters. Thus, the early theory was that those with dyslexia have developmental defects in the parietal region of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left parietal involvement was also somewhat confirmed during pathological examination of the brains of those who died at an earlier age and were known to be dyslexic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important theory focuses on delayed brain lateralization in dyslexia. It is thought that some people have weak or insufficient brain lateralization that hinders the understanding of languages. This theory was the subject of multiple studies in the second half of last century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest research into the neurophysiology of those living with dyslexia seems to indicate that dyslexia is phonological in nature: dyslexics have difficulty in manipulating the phoneme parts of speech. It is possible that there are developmental issues in the visual tract or other visual mechanisms in the brain may be contributing to the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from defects in a specific subsystem of the vision pathway, researchers think that there are other brain developmental issues involved as well. It is entirely possible that people with dyslexia have temporal processing impairment, and therefore they are not able to process information fast enough. Thus, dyslexia is considered the result of multi-system deficits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is probably the result of deficits in the brain at multiple levels. There is an impaired phoneme discrimination resulting in difficulty in understanding spelling. Visual perceptual impairment leads to further worsening of word recognition, and phonological awareness impairment causes speech disturbances. In the center of all this is delayed temporal processing. The end result is delayed speech development, difficulties in reading and comprehending texts, and poor academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes a dyslexic a successful person?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Leonardo da Vinci to Einstein, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/16/opening-the-classroom-door-for-children-with-autism/&quot;&gt;children with learning disabilities&lt;/a&gt; prove that there is a limited link between disability and intelligence. Children with dyslexia are at least equally intelligent to non-dyslexic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher success of individuals with dyslexia in certain professions is probably the result of resilience or compensatory mechanisms that they cultivate during the school days to overcome their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these kids may develop better skills for interacting with others. They may focus more on specific arts or sciences. Many of them may not concentrate on studies and instead start doing business at an early age. This means that they can be found in any profession, and in the long run they are equally successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensatory mechanisms developed at a young age may provide an edge over others in specific areas when the children grow up. Even though dyslexics may score poorly in school, they may outscore other children in practical life since they spend more time perfecting their verbal skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an entrepreneur, dyslexics are known to be good at delegating tasks, they are excellent mentors, and they are often creative. All of these qualities usually make them more successful entrepreneurs, though they may not be that good in roles where there is less space for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving success with dyslexia is perhaps about learning different skills, mastering different approaches to solving the tasks, and developing strategies to compensate for certain limitations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise – any activity that gets your heart pumping harder – improves &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/19/10-ways-that-running-changes-your-mind-and-brain/&quot;&gt;mood, anxiety and memory.&lt;/a&gt; It can help people with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. Now there’s evidence, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00167/full&quot;&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, that a programme of regular aerobic exercise also reduces psychopathology in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. And it seems to have a particular impact on so-called “negative” symptoms, such as apathy and loss of emotional feeling, which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528757&quot;&gt;not improved by standard drug treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[W]hile antipsychotics [drug treatments] are essential in treating schizophrenia, interventions other than antipsychotic treatment…may be needed to achieve better outcomes,” write the authors of the new study, led by Peng-Wei Wang at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 62 patients, all of whom had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia at least a year ago, and whose antipsychotic medication dosage had been stable for at least three months. These participants were randomly allocated into either an aerobic exercise group (30 minutes of “vigorous” aerobic exercise, taking into account each participant’s maximum heart rate) or a control group who performed stretching exercises (25 minutes of flexibility, toning and balance exercises), with a goal of five sessions a week, for 12 weeks. Not all participants managed to stick to the minimum requirement of three sessions per week for the full three months. But 24 in the exercise group and 22 in the control group did complete the study.  (There were no significant differences in gender make-up, age of onset of schizophrenia, or mean dosage of antipsychotics between the two groups.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist who was blind to the group allocations used a standard schizophrenia symptom evaluation scale to interview and evaluate all the participants at the start of the study; at the end of the 12 week intervention; and again, three months on. The control group showed no improvements in positive (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) or negative symptoms, or general psychopathology, during the intervention or the follow-up period. But for the aerobic exercise group, it was a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the 12-week intervention, their overall psychopathology and level of negative and positive symptoms decreased. Three months later, these improvements had been maintained (and, in the case of negative symptoms, actually continued to improve). Also, the more severe their negative symptoms and general psychopathology at the start of the study, the bigger their improvements by the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results imply that [aerobic exercise] could be a good non-pharmacotherapeutic intervention for antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia,” the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various possible explanations for the effects. Vigorous exercise can boost levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (other work has found that enhancing glutamate function can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia); increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (which is involved in repairing damaged brain cells and triggering the growth of new ones; low levels of BDNF are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia); and also help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis – the stress response system. “HPA dysfunction is an important characteristic in schizophrenia,” the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is a one-off 12-week programme really enough to produce lasting – and even escalating – improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not collect data on how much exercise the aerobic group did in the three months between the end of the 12-week intervention and the final assessment. If the participants continued to exercise, this may have accounted for the ongoing improvements. Future research will have to explore this. But if an exercise programme does have to be maintained, given all the manifold benefits, surely that’s no bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

BIO attracted companies, academic centers, patient groups, researchers, investors, and even celebrities such as cancer survivor and award-winning journalist Robin Roberts as well as director, actor, and advocate Rob Reiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had the honor of participating in this historic conference, and so we’d like to share select highlights with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;KEYNOTE SPEECHES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I believe in dreaming big and focusing small ~ great words to live by. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RobinRoberts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RobinRoberts&lt;/a&gt; BIOConvention &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JimGreenwood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JimGreenwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bio2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#bio2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/x2VsBiJS35&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/x2VsBiJS35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jennifer Landress (@jlandress) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jlandress/status/1004002670661853184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tweet capturing the Robin Roberts’ interview with BIO’s chief Jim Greenwood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Roberts, ABC’s Good Morning America journalist, kicked off BIO. She discussed her triumphant victory over cancer and her trailblazing career in journalism during her interview with BIO president and chief executive officer Jim Greenwood.&lt;br /&gt;She also acknowledged how the collective work of people such as those attending BIO is the reason she is alive today.“This is the importance of why I want to meet with this group, to say thank you for the life-saving bone marrow transplant that I had,” she said, “It’s not about what we accomplish, it’s about what we overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts also noted in her conversation with Greenwood, that she believed “in dreaming big and focusing small.” In other words, accomplishing great things takes time; Rome wasn’t built in a day, as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Actor/Director Rob Reiner to address Bio Int.

Reiner urged the audience to continue working on drug research. He also shared a personal story about his son overcoming drug addiction and said, “We have a long way to go in trying to understand what causes people to want to use and how to treat them. There is no question about it; it’s an epidemic. I mean it’s rife across this country…people talk about doing something and don’t do anything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;ANNOUNCEMENT &amp;amp; AWARDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;BIO has become a launching platform for new partnerships, ventures, and awards. To illustrate, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) unveiled a new initiative called DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) to come up with new solutions to some of the toughest health security challenges we are faced with such as early detection of illness and sepsis. Another announcement that caught everyone’s attention was a five-year alliance between Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson (J&amp;amp;J) and Boston University – an attempt to change the way we detect and treat lung cancer today. J&amp;amp;J will fund a Lung Cancer Center at Boston University Medical Center as part of this new alliance. Just as important, the Henri A. Termeer Biotechnology Visionary Award was given to Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for the innovative spirit and transformative impact on patients’ lives. This is the first-ever award created in honor of the late Genzyme CEO who was instrumental in transforming Boston into a thriving hub of life science research, development and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;WORLD AT BIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Thousands of attendees from over 74 different countries participated in the event, and most of the essential biotech hubs and nations had a presence in the form of pavilions and summits at the event. For example, a “conference-within-a-conference” called the China Summit was one of the country-specific meetings at BIO which highlighted the complexities of the world’s second-largest biotech market, and among other vital issues focused on the importance of collaboration between U.S. and China in the scientific research and business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Great turnout at the China Summit at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIO2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#BIO2018&lt;/a&gt; - great timing too given news flow like CStone/Blueprint deal &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BPMC&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;$BPMC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sq13t1Gpxw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sq13t1Gpxw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Berlin (@BioPharmaJosh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BioPharmaJosh/status/1003683091515396102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tweet gives a&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;glimpse of the China Summit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Canada’s presence at BIO couldn’t be ignored&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Economic development and tech transfer teams, businesses, scientists, and government officials from The Great White North were seen everywhere.

The organization is a non-profit spinoff of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — the world’s wealthiest charity. Dr. Penny Heaton described the mission and approach of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute and discussed the roles of both organizations and their strategies to combat infectious diseases globally. MRI aims to develop products that will potentially eradicate diarrheal disease and end the TB epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;PARTY AT BIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Although we didn’t attend the over-the-top party called&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/unofficial-party-at-bio-featured-dancers-plastered-company-logos-outraging-leadership&quot;&gt; PABNAB&lt;/a&gt;, our team had a great time interacting with our customers and partners at BIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;team-science-exchange&quot; height=&quot;852&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/image1-769x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Science Exchange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;FDA at BIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The world’s most powerful regulator, Scott Gottlieb, was also present. During the &lt;i&gt;Fireside Chats&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;i&gt;BIO 2018,&lt;/i&gt; the FDA commissioner expressed his thoughts on developing lower-cost generics and biosimilars. He also shed light on other things such as gene therapy, the opioid crisis, more opportunities for patients, and the new Right to Try law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;SPOTTED INNOVATIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bolder;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many innovative technologies and businesses also caught our attention. To illustrate, innovations like real-time patient monitoring, video collaboration tools, 3D cell cultures, AI-enabled knowledge databases, microfluidic platforms, virtual reality 3D molecular visualization, and new inventive liquid biopsy technologies were big head-turners at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In addition, we learned about new innovative initiatives by biotech companies, big and small alike. One such company is Recombinetics; they employ gene-editing technology not just to improve human health but also to improve the health, well-being and productivity of animals. The company’s gene-editing technology can potentially be used to create animals with welfare traits, such as pigs that don’t need to be castrated, hornless cattle, heat-tolerant livestock and other disease-resistant animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Another example is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. In his “Bio Buzz” Interview, John Maraganore, the company’s CEO, talked about an entirely new class of medicines derived from the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of advances in RNA interference (RNAi). With investigational RNAi therapeutics, it is possible to block the production of disease-causing proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Just as important, Amgen shared its approach to treating migraines. The company believes a new method of theirs can treat a problem that affects nearly one billion people across the globe – migraines!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;If you couldn’t attend, we hope our coverage of this year’s BIO convention gave you a sense of its scale, history and importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If personality traits are a genuine concept and not merely an artefact of psychologists’ imagination, then how people choose to spend their time ought to correlate with their scores on personality questionnaires, notwithstanding the constraints of life that prevent us from doing what we want. In fact, there are relatively few studies that have looked at correlations between traits and everyday behaviour, and of those that have, many relied on student volunteers (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170518-the-everyday-habits-that-reveal-our-personalities&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an overview).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.112/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;Collabra&lt;/em&gt; helps plug this research gap – Julia Rohrer and Richard Lucas analysed the “Big Five” trait personality scores of over 1,300 German volunteers (part of a nationally representative sample), average age 51 years, who on three successive years completed detailed diaries of what they had been up to the day before. Specifically, they indicated whether they had spent any time, and if so how much, on nine key activities the previous day, including socialising, work, chores and watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34060&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, controlling for age and gender, will mostly make comfortable reading for personality psychologists. For instance, consistent with trait theory, high scorers on conscientiousness spent more time working and studying, whether they were full-time employed or not. Similarly, strong extraverts, the highly agreeable and open-minded were more likely to report socialising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other findings are more nuanced and intriguing. For instance, the highly conscientiousness were no more or less likely to report watching TV the previous day, but they reported watching it for less time. Meanwhile, extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness all went together with less time spent reading. In contrast, openness to experience was correlated with reading, and a trend toward reading for longer. Openness also correlated with time spent playing sports. Cultural activities, which typically correlate with openness, were not assessed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing findings concerned chores – against trait theory, the highly conscientiousness were no more likely to say they’d spent time on chores (even though orderliness is a key facet of conscientiousness), perhaps because they had everything in order already, whereas the highly neurotic (i.e. people with low emotional stability who typically experience more low moods) were more likely to say they’d done some chores the previous day, and for longer. Again it’s speculation, but perhaps this is because the emotionally unstable find disorder and clutter more upsetting, while at the same time not necessarily being particularly adept at keeping order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a trend toward agreeableness correlating with doing chores. This chimes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917303094&quot;&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; that found, more specifically, that agreeableness correlated with spending more time ironing and washing up. The likely explanation in both cases is that highly agreeable people are more concerned with doing things that benefit others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach of asking people whether they’d performed an activity at all, and if so, for how long, also threw up some interesting contradictions. For instance, high scorers on openness were more likely to report socialising, yet at the same time, they tended to report doing so for less time than low scorers, perhaps because they had so many other competing demands on their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main weakness of this new data is its reliance (as in so much personality research) on people’s self-reports of their traits and behaviour, and the memory challenge for them of recalling what they’d been doing the previous day and for how long. Nonetheless, the findings serve to complement similar efforts using different approaches. “Our study suggests that even under the constraints of everyday life, personality shows modest [effect sizes were in the range of .1 to .2] but meaningful associations with daily patterns,” Rohrer and Lucas concluded. “Personality therefore qualifies as a real-world phenomenon, exerting its influence beyond the context of the research laboratory and allowing for strong descriptions of human life.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Last month, the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition pulled an article on fecal transplantation for a reason that, well, doesn’t pass the sniff test. The paper, by Sonia Michail of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, appeared online in October 2017 and described a randomized controlled trial of fecal transplants to treat kids with ulcerative colitis. … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/19/fecal-transplant-paper-pulled-for-personal-issue/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Fecal transplant paper pulled for “personal issue”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Psychology can help people one person at a time, but it also holds the promise of changing society at a mass scale, through campaigns to change attitudes and behaviour. One such endeavour is the development of programmes to reduce the rates of sexual assault of women on university campuses. But in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646&quot;&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Aggression and Violent Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the University of California make the case that such programmes may not just be ineffective, but counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34047&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the US passed its Violence Against Women Act; in response most US university campuses launched programmes that aimed to reduce sexual assault by raising awareness, changing attitudes and behaviours and encouraging bystanders to take a stand. But there has been little systematic evaluation of these programmes, and the evidence for any benefits is thus far thin. Of the 140 college-based behaviour change programmes studied by the Center for Disease Control, it recommended only three on the balance of evidence; all three focused on changing bystander action and two of the three merely showed “promise of effectiveness”. Other reviews have produced slightly more positive conclusions but often with weak effects or without evidence of actual behaviour change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly become clear that well-meaning interventions in other contexts can have the opposite effect to that intended; we’ve previously covered instances of backfiring interventions that aimed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/08/the-imagined-contact-intervention-for-reducing-prejudice-can-backfire/&quot;&gt;reduce prejudice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/&quot;&gt;correct false beliefs on vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/11/pressuring-employees-to-be-do-gooders-can-backfire-badly/&quot;&gt;encourage employees to behave better in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason boomerang effects are such a concern in the domain of sexual assault is that most interventions are being designed and evaluated around a broad target group – men – rather than looking at effects on the most high-risk individuals. Yet we know from previous evidence that the people most likely to respond contrarily are those most disposed to the problem behaviour in the first place. For instance, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0193841X16666196&quot;&gt;intervention intended to reduce acceptance of violent video games&lt;/a&gt; in students was effective for many participants, but post-intervention, those who had been classified as living a delinquent lifestyle became more enthusiastic about playing the games.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://refhub.elsevier.com/S1359-1789(17)30364-6/rf0040&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that an anti-violence campaign was effective in increasing opposition to violence in people low in trait aggression, but those who were highly aggressive became more enthusiastic about violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boomerang effects seem to happen when participants experience reactance: anger stemming from the sense that a mode of life or thinking is threatened combined with “motivated reasoning” – like finding reasons to doubt the source of the message. In the midst of reactance, the person sees themselves as defiantly resisting preachy attempts to deny them their entitlement.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is reactance likely to happen with the men most likely to commit sexual assault? Well, consider this profile of high-risk individuals: they tend to have hostility towards women, experience sexual arousal when physical force is involved, and have an impersonal sexual orientation (intimacy is not a prerequisite for what they seek in sex). As well as these sex-related factors, they tend to be anti-social, highly entitled and narcissistic. Evidence suggests these individuals are less likely to respond to cues of sexual disinterest, feeling that women are really into them or will be eventually, and they react more aggressively to interpersonal rejection. This seems a potent recipe for reactance.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-06-19 09.31.14.png&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-34050 alignright&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;34050&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screenshot 2018-06-19 09.31.14&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/screenshot-2018-06-19-09-31-14.png?w=845?w=370&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/screenshot-2018-06-19-09-31-14.png?w=845?w=212&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/screenshot-2018-06-19-09-31-14.png?w=845&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;370,524&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/19/new-literature-review-most-sexual-assault-interventions-are-likely-to-increase-offending-among-high-risk-men/screenshot-2018-06-19-09-31-14/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/screenshot-2018-06-19-09-31-14.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;There isn’t much evidence from existing anti-sexual assault programmes on specifically how these high-risk individuals respond, but smaller-scale experimental work reveals troubling signs. Messages promoting gender equality and greater consideration for women lead to lower aggressive tendencies for men already low in sexist attitudes, but more aggression among those who held more sexist attitudes from the start. A video intended to reduce acceptance of rape myths and increase victim empathy worked for men who had no history of sexually aggressive behaviour, but the high-risk men showed a boomerang effect. On the other hand, some experimental studies have shown some intervention content can have the desired effect on high-risk individuals, e.g. improving victim empathy. But if you hit the target on some occasions, and shoot yourself in the foot on others, you would want to take a good look at your technique before rolling it out nationwide.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger is that interventions could produce impressive-seeming results simply because the low-risk majority perceive sexual assault as even more deplorable than they already did – while the (roughly 30 per cent) of higher-risk men become even more intent on their agenda. Of course, such interventions may prevent certain sexual assaults – for example, through limiting predation opportunities through galvanising bystanders to act. But surely we should be working to maximise impact on those likely to commit the bulk of the assaults, rather than fire up their motivation still further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646&quot;&gt;Sexual assault interventions may be doing more harm than good with high-risk males&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neurotransmitter Oxytocin is widely known for its role in the regulation of social bonding as well as romantic attachment. It was initially discovered over 100 years ago after an extract derived from the human posterior pituitary gland was found to cause uterine contractions in pregnant cats. Since 1909 our understanding of this nonapeptide has somewhat progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin binds a G protein coupled receptor that is coded for by the OXTR gene. Binding of oxytocin to its receptor unleashes a signalling cascade within the cell, leading to both psychological and physiological changes.  Much attention has been given to the OXTR gene as its expression essentially controls the rate limiting step in the oxytocin signalling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; this month looks at the possibility of a link between OXTR gene methylation and corresponding changes in social and emotional behaviour in human populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still insufficient evidence to draw strong conclusions, early findings point towards a correlation between specific elevated patterns of methylation and impaired cognitive and social emotional behaviour. Conversely, impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish these patterns with greater certainty, more research is required to understand the relationship between OXTR gene methylation and OXTR expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-10261&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/headphones-300x201.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;It is thought that approximately 36% of the world’s population currently use a smart phone, with around 2.1 billion worldwide users reported in 2016. A significant number of these smartphone owning individuals are likely to take advantage of music playing applications found ubiquitously across most smartphone models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, listening to music on a smartphone or personal listening device comes with a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) have warned many young adults are at risk of developing recreational noise induced hearing loss due to frequent exposure to noisy environments. It is thought that nearly 50% of young people aged from 12- 35 years of age in developed counties are exposed to dangerously high levels of music through their personal listening devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone manufacturers have now implemented their own recommendations for minimum volumes at which hearing loss may occur. However these volumes vary, even within different smartphone models issued by the same company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, authors Gibbeum Kim and Woojae Han put 6 smartphones to the test, using four genres of Korean pop music to determine the first risk volume level as defined by each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicated a considerable 8-dB difference in sound pressure levels detected across the six devices, with dance-pop music having the highest output level of the genres tested. Based on these conclusions, the implementation of an international standard for safe use output volume is suggested across all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC International Health and Human Rights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-018-0160-8&quot;&gt;Causes of death among street-connected children and youth in Eldoret, Kenya.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that homeless people will have lower life expectancy on average than their housed and settled counterparts. One recent study estimated the homeless youth of San Francisco to have a mortality rate that was 10 times that of the general population. Drug related deaths and suicide featured as the most common causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, little information exists on the causes of youth mortality in low and middle-income countries. A recent study published &lt;em&gt;in BMC International Health and Human Rights&lt;/em&gt; has documented the causes of death among street connected youth in Eldoret, Western Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes of death of in Eldoret differ considerably from those in San Francisco. In Eldoret, HIV accounted for 37% of all deaths, killing 59% of females included in the study and roughly a quarter of all men. Among the male population, the greatest cause of death was assault, accounting for nearly 50% of recorded deaths in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaths for reasons such as these are largely preventable. The authors advocate appropriate responses such as targeted HIV treatment programs and child protection systems to decrease the prevalence of assault and HIV and thus avoidable youth mortality in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-10262&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/wasp-300x298.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;This study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt; investigates the evolutionary history of apoidea, a superfamily that includes apoid wasps and bees. A barrier to understanding the evolution of apoidea has been the difficulty in determining the geological age of bees as well as their phylogenetic origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Ohl’s group from the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science in Berlin have pooled and analysed target DNA enrichment sites and transcriptomic sequence data, covering all major lineages in the apoidea superfamily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ammoplanina, a family of predatory wasps, began to lose their taste for thrips around 128 million years ago. Over time, they acquired a plant-based diet and evolved into what we now know as the modern bee. Further research must be done to understand the specific traits that enabled this radical dietary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, is the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion. The freedom to manifest these beliefs, however, can be limited by law if thought to pose a risk to public health for example, or infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under most abortion laws enacted across the developed world, a conscience clause is included, permitting the conscientious objection of healthcare professionals to opt out of providing such services on moral grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heated debate has ensued regarding the extent to which the rights of healthcare professionals to refuse provision of abortion services should be limited, in case this should infringe on a woman’s legal right to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, aims to elucidate the reasons given for declining to participate in abortion on grounds of conscience. Surprisingly, it was found the viewpoints of midwives and nurses were largely absent from this debate, despite being the recommended providers of abortion services by the WHO. Across the literature studied, conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, better representation of all relevant healthcare professionals in the debate and the consideration of all viewpoints is necessary when discussing such a sensitive topic, in order to inform beneficial health policy in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the ages of 35 to 44, 69% of US citizens are reported to have lost at least one tooth. 15 million of this population will have undergone crown and bridge replacements for missing teeth, while only 3 million of these have been reported to have had dental implants. However this number is said to be growing by half a million every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental implants may be surgically inserted into a patient’s jaw, in order to support the introduction of a prosthetic element such as a crown or bridge. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful tool, providng high-quality, 3-dimensional images of surrounding tissues to aid this process. The low cost and reasonable dose of radiation administered has caused the popularity of this method to increase over recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt; this month, Michael Bornstein’s group from the University of Leuven in Belgium review current literature to provide recommendations for the future use of CBCT imaging. Due to relatively high radiation doses, its clinical usage should be justified. For example, the authors advise to limit CBCT to cases involving post-operative complications following dental implant insertion, as well as the avoidance of this procedure in long term maintenance and follow up of dental implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of standardisation of radiation dose and image quality between different CBCT machines further prompted calls for more research to consistently achieve the lowest diagnostically acceptable radiation dose possible.&lt;/p&gt;
