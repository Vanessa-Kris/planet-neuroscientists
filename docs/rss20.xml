	<description>&lt;p&gt;A journal is planning to retract a paper that purported to link a component of vaccines to autism in mice. The paper, about the effects of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines on the immune response in the brains of mice, is the second retraction for co-authors Christopher Shaw and Lucija Tomljenovic, of the University of British […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Can Deadly Zika Virus Cure Brain Cancer?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22930</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/09/can-deadly-zika-virus-be-used-as-an-anti-cancer-tool/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, Zika virus was dominating headlines. A new infection was hardly ever heard about before then, yet is now affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Latin America, causing disfiguration and microcephalia in new-born babies. Microcephalia is caused by severe delayed and abnormal development of the brain, resulting in the range of intellectual disability, dwarfism, poor motor functions and speech. With no cure or even preventive vaccination available, many women in the most affected regions were reportedly considering postponing any planned pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was actually discovered back in 1947 in Zika forest in Uganda (and this is where its name comes from). The pathogen is related to better known viruses causing dengue and yellow fever. The disease is spread predominantly by one type of mosquito and was a rare occurrence until the epidemics of 2015–2016, when in Brazil alone well over 100,000 cases were reported. The disease caused particular concern as it coincided with the run-up to the 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from mosquitoes, the virus can be spread through sexual contact and from mother to child during &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/12/top-pregnancy-and-labor-apps/&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; or at delivery. The latter way of transmission is a particular concern: while adults suffer only very mild symptoms (fever and rush), children infected during pregnancy suffer major &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/&quot;&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that viral infection delays brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research identified a more specific reason: Zika virus specifically targets neural progenitor cells, the cells responsible for production of other neurons. This is what makes the virus very dangerous for the developing fetus. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/&quot;&gt;Neuron progenitor cells&lt;/a&gt; are abundant in the developing fetal brain. However, only a few are left in the brain of adults. In adults with completely formed brain, Zika virus infection causes only mild symptoms, if any (Zika fever). But the specificity with which the virus targets neural progenitor cells gave researchers an idea that might revolutionize the treatment of one of the deadliest types of brain cancer—glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat, with patients rarely surviving even one year after diagnosis. Unfortunately, this is also one of the most common types of brain cancer. Approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with glioblastoma in the US alone. The quick return of the disease even after aggressive surgery is caused by the survival of a few glioblastoma stem cells. Many  types of cancer like glioblastoma grow due to the existence of cancer stem cells that give rise to other tumor cells. The glioblastoma stem cells remain almost unaffected by all radio- and chemotherapy regiments currently used to treat this malignancy, even though these therapeutic approaches do kill other cells in the tumor. They also successfully avoid detection and elimination by the immune system, allowing the regrowth of cancer in a short period of time after surgery, replenishing the cancer cells eliminated by therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that glioblastoma stem cells are, in many ways, very similar to normal neural progenitor cells. Therefore, infecting a person with glioblastoma with Zika virus might help in treating the disease by eliminating the stem cells. This was a core idea that researchers initially tested on cancer cells from tumors obtained from surgeries. It turned out that the virus does indeed kill cancer stem cells, leaving other cancer cells almost unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further make sure that the virus doesn’t affect the normal cells of the brain, scientists have performed experiments on brain tissues from patients with epilepsy. The tests did not detect any damage to these cells due to viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that combining traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/&quot;&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; with treatment with Zika virus may help to eliminate stem and non-stem cancer cells. Such an outcome will most certainly be beneficial for the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the idea further, scientists injected Zika virus directly into the brain of mice with brain tumors. In all animals infected with the disease, tumor growth slowed down significantly and the animals survived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that Zika virus can be injected into the brain of a glioblastoma patient at the time of surgery. The subsequent chemotherapy will remove any remaining cancer cells that survived surgery, and Zika virus will kill the residual glioblastoma stem cells. The published findings also suggest that the virus can be further engineered to be more easily eliminated from normal healthy brain cells using the patient’s immune system. Less harmful strains of the virus have already been developed to this end and have demonstrated some success in animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if a successful therapeutic approach to treat deadly glioblastoma can be developed using Zika virus. The path to future use of Zika-based treatment in hospitals will likely be long. The original results, however, are very encouraging. This new approach is another fascinating example of a growing number of new innovative tools that are currently being developed to treat a variety of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Ankur Sinha: Fedora Classroom: Git 101: report</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ankursinha.in,2017-10-07:/blog/2017/10/07/fedora-classroom-git-101-report.html</guid>
	<link>http://ankursinha.in/blog/2017/10/07/fedora-classroom-git-101-report.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I taught another &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom&quot;&gt;Fedora Classroom&lt;/a&gt; this week, on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2017-10-05/fedora-classroom.2017-10-05-14.17.log.html&quot;&gt;Git 101&lt;/a&gt;. I used the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;
again since this session was to be another hands-on walkthrough. I reckon I've
now learned that hands-on sessions go on longer than initially planned. This
one lasted about three hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;some-metrics&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: 3 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees: ~25 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentences spoken: LOTS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't go much into the theory, and there's a lot of it in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I
had made it my goal to walk the attendees through the usual &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; workflow.
So, that's exactly what we did. We started by setting up an empty repository,
then added files to it, learned how to see changes and so on. Then, we moved
on to branching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd explored the advantages of using branches we started working with
remotes. Everyone set up repositories on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. To end with, I
got everyone to fork my repository and submit pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone got the hang of it. There were some good questions, a bit of
discussion too. I do hope it'll get more people to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to
different projects on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;feedback-is-always-welcome&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback is always welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some
feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#fedora-classroom on Freenode &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23fedora-classroom&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback
privately. I'm FranciscoD on quite a few Fedora IRC channels, and I can be
reached via e-mail on my Fedora address at ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org.
All suggestions, comments, criticism is most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More instructors needed!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classroom sessions are going rather well, but &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Help_wanted&quot;&gt;we still need more help&lt;/a&gt;. We'd like to cover
more topics from different areas, not just tech related- everything from
design, to free software philosophy and community building! If there's anything
at all you think is worth a classroom session, please get in touch with the
team on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Fedora classroom mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. A log of all past sessions -
whether on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; or on a video platform are maintained on the wiki page &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Previous_Sessions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for everyone to
peruse at their convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Excessive Porn Consumption Can Cause Erectile Dysfunction – Myth or Truth?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22918</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing trend of healthy young men using medications like Viagra and Cialis, drugs intended for older men and those with health-related erectile dysfunction (ED).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these young men (unknowingly?) use these drugs to treat a condition that is psychological rather than physiological: porn-induced &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/07/30/vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-its-neurological-consequences/&quot;&gt;erectile dysfunction &lt;/a&gt;(PEID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online social groups and websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainonporn.com/&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Porn&lt;/a&gt; and Reddit’s “no fap” group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&lt;/a&gt;) were founded to help men with PIED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, studies that checked for a connection between watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;porn&lt;/a&gt; and erectile dysfunction found no evidence associating the two. If that’s the case, what explains the sharp rise in ED cases in young men in recent years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B8-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;Swiss researchers&lt;/a&gt; used the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), finding an ED rate of 30% in a cross-section of Swiss men aged 18 to 24. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B9-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;2013 Italian study&lt;/a&gt; reported that one in four patients who sought help for new-onset ED were younger than 40, with rates of severe ED nearly 10% higher than in men over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Takeesha Roland-Jenkins (MS in psychology and MS in neurology) a professional consultant for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betweenusclinic.com&quot;&gt;Between Us Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, to weigh in. Takeesha is an expert in both psychology and neurology, and she has a unique insight into both the psyche and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your opinion, can excessive porn consumption really cause a man to experience erectile dysfunction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, watching hardcore porn excessively, especially pornography with deviant and violent behavior can cause mental changes that may result in erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in a man’s brain when he is exposed to extreme sexual stimuli (such as hardcore pornography) and how does this relate to ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore pornography is often graphic and generally displays deviant, violent, and abnormally kinky behavior. This is not typical for the average sexual encounter and it can create unrealistic mental perceptions of how a man should engage in sexual activity. Furthermore, a man may initially get a thrill from watching what he believes is an exotic encounter, but over time excessive porn watching desensitizes men to intense sexual stimuli and even sexual violence which sometimes occurs in the porn that is being viewed, thereby lowering the ability to engage in true intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornography, in general, causes intense mental stimulation that changes the way the brain views sexual activity and sexual violence in pornography exaggerates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;alterations in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is similar to becoming more tolerant to a certain drug after prolonged use; meaning you eventually need higher and higher doses to experience the same feelings of euphoria. Repeatedly watching hard-core porn can have a similar effect on sexual performance. In other words, watching excessive porn changes the way the brain processes sexual arousal and activity, often leading to desensitization that lowers libido and causes psychological erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say that men who watch too much porn can develop performance anxiety. Why does anxiety affect the ability to get and maintain an erection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because a man’s brain has now become accustomed to getting stimulated at the sight of intense pornographic images, an ordinary encounter will cause the man to wonder if he will be able to perform at a similar level (e.g., for extended periods) as what has been observed in a pornographic video. Therefore, the performance anxiety is still related to the changes that occur in the brain and wondering if he can satisfy his partner in the manner that the brain has become used to. In other words, the anxiety is a direct result of worrying about being able to re-enact the sexual scenes in porn; this unrealistic goal can lead to performance anxiety. Subsequently, a man may get an erection, but after beginning to worry about whether he can perform like the actors in porn, the erection may soften or stop altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, other than performance anxiety, is there another reason why porn could cause men to experience ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes that occur in the brain’s ability to lead to an erection contributes more to PIED than performance anxiety. Over time the brain needs increasing levels of stimulation from the pornography in order to initiate an erection. Performance anxiety can unfortunately worsen erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does porn-induced erectile dysfunction cure itself if the man stops watching porn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discontinuing pornographic viewing does not automatically cure PIED. Furthermore, drugs such as Viagra or Cialis target the physical aspect of erectile dysfunction, not the psychological aspect. This means that a man will become completely dependent upon such drugs until the brain restores its ability to initiate an erection under ordinary sexual circumstances. A healthy relationship (e.g., marriage) with a patient partner can help a man overcome PIED over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What form of treatment would you recommend a man who suffers from PIED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneficial treatment would be in the form of individualized therapy, which may vary in time (e.g., weeks, months) depending on the individual and the degree of PIED. As PIED is often the result of an addiction to pornography, this form of treatment should be viewed as the first step to addiction recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of therapy is to begin to desensitize the brain to the pornographic images and to address some of the reasons that the addiction to porn more than likely started. Men are also encouraged to reconnect intimately with their partners in order to help the brain restore its ability to initiate sexual arousal during ordinary sexual encounters. Overall, a man must be willing to give himself time to gradually overcome PIED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/snow-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-9423&quot; height=&quot;1944&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2592&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an Adjunct lecturer at Edith Cowan University, Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquatic microbial ecology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the small invisible things that are all around us and particular their presence and role in nutrient cycling in extreme aquatic environments such as glacial melt pools and microbially dominated lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went on my first trip to the Arctic doing research in Svalbard, the beauty and sterile environment of the Arctic fascinated me. I kept this fascination of extreme environments, and continued and did my Ph.D. in the Antarctic where I got to experience the low light environment in the winter months. After my time in the Antarctic, I spent a few more years in the sub-arctic of Sweden, where again I experienced the beautiful low light environment that is associated with the polar winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo was taken on the sea ice in Prydz Bay in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. I took it with my old Nikon camera, a pretty standard camera and the photo was taken from the seat of my quad motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part of my Ph.D. in the Antarctic and was there for just over a year; when this particular photo was taken in June I was heading back to the Davis research station from one of the huts called bandits hut after a “jolly trip” (i.e. weekend break away from the station) with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the winter months in the Antarctic and the Arctic, you get these fantastic pink skies as the sun never really rises above the horizon; in this photo I was lucky to get the moon in the perfect position between the two icebergs on the sea ice. I still remember the moment as we were riding our bikes on the sea ice in this eerie pink light and seeing the moon perfectly positioned between the towering ice bergs, just one of them moments that will be with me forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eerie, but also soft, light of the pink Antarctic winter skies and the perfect symmetry of the moon right in between the icebergs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain situations where it’s advantageous for an introvert to take charge. For instance, perhaps they are better qualified than their extroverted peers. The trouble is, most introverts tend to shy away from seizing informal leadership opportunities when they arise (psychologists call this “emergent leadership” – when someone takes charge in a team without a formal hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917305767#bb0125&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; suggests this might be because introverts expect to find group tasks and situations unpleasant, which inhibits them from displaying the kind of behaviours required to take charge of their group. By helping introverts to realise they may enjoy leadership more than they expect, Andrew Spark and his colleagues at Queensland University of Technology say it may be possible to encourage more introverts to step up to the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31060&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a study of nearly 200 undergrad business students who completed personality tests prior to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Survival_Lesson.html&quot;&gt;group task&lt;/a&gt; devised by NASA which involves making decisions together about survival priorities on the moon. Before they started the group task, the students rated how much they thought they would find it fun and exciting or scary and stressful. Afterwards they rated each other for signs of emergent leadership during the task, such as “he/she influenced group decisions” or “he/she led the group conversation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, introverts showed less emergent leadership than extraverts. What’s more, compared with extraverts, they also expected to experience much more negative emotion and feelings during the group task. These two factors seemed to be related: when fully accounting for any differences in participants’ negative expectations, introversion was no longer associated with less emergent leadership. The researchers’ methodology can’t prove that negative expectations cause introverts to refrain from showing leadership, but their findings are consistent with that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23586413&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that suggests introverts find acting extraverted more enjoyable than they think they will, Spark and his team suggest that perhaps introverts will also enjoy leadership-related behaviours more than they anticipate. “If introverts can develop strategies to more accurately forecast their enjoyment of behavior more conducive to emergent leadership,” the researchers said, “then it is possible that such individuals will be on a level playing field with extraverts in relevant social situations”. However, the researchers added “these possibilities are somewhat speculative at this point”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature has added an “editor’s note” to a high-profile August paper alerting readers to the fact that the article has been subject to criticism.

&lt;p&gt;Do their homework or reach over there for the iPad and dive into a world of games? It’s the ever-present dilemma facing young children today. Here’s a simple technique that could tip the balance a little in favour of the homework. Psychologists have &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12695/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that when four- to six-year-olds pretended to be Batman while they were doing a boring but important task, it helped them to resist distraction and stay more focused. The challenge now is to nail down exactly why the technique works, and to see if over time it could improve children’s self-regulation skills without them needing to go through the ritual of pretending to be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30939&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel White and her colleagues, including Angela Duckworth famous for her work on “grit”, recruited 180 kids aged 4 to 6 years and had them take some basic psych tests assessing their mental control, memory and empathy. Next the researchers asked them to complete a boring, slow but supposedly important ten-minute computer task that involved pressing the space bar whenever they saw a picture of cheese or not pressing anything when the screen showed a cat. The children were encouraged to stay on task, but they were told they could take a break whenever they wanted and go play a game on a nearby iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the children were assigned to a “self-immersed condition”, akin to a control group, and before and during the task were told to reflect on how they were doing, asking themselves “Am I working hard?”. Other children were asked to reflect from a third-person perspective, asking themselves “Is James [insert child’s actual name] working hard?” Finally, the rest of the kids were in the Batman condition, in which they were asked to imagine they were either Batman, Bob The Builder, Rapunzel or Dora the Explorer and to ask themselves “Is Batman [or whichever character they were] working hard?”. Children in this last condition were given a relevant prop to help, such as Batman’s cape. Once every minute through the task, a recorded voice asked the question appropriate for the condition each child was in [Are you working hard? or Is James working hard? or Is Batman working hard?].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-year-olds spent more time on task than the four-year-olds (half the time versus about a quarter of the time). No surprise there. But across age groups, and apparently unrelated to their personal scores on mental control, memory, or empathy, those in the Batman condition spent the most time on task (about 55 per cent for the six-year-olds; about 32 per cent for the four-year-olds). The children in the self-immersed condition spent the least time on task (about 35 per cent of the time for the six-year-olds; just over 20 per cent for the four-year-olds) and those in the third-person condition performed in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that pretending to be a popular fictional character helps young children to resist distraction, at least compared to the other conditions used in this experiment. White and her team think this is probably at least partly because it helps create a feeling of self-distance from the task, which is known to help people resist immediate distractions and prioritise longer-term goals. The trouble is, there are so many other aspects to the Batman condition that could have led to its apparent benefits, such as perhaps it simply made the boring task more fun, or maybe the children identified with their fictional character and assumed some of his or her qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of the origins of the benefits [of the Batman condition] seen here, it is important to note that pretending to be another character had large effects on children’s perseverance,” the researchers said. They note that the great American psychologist William James observed how “voluntarily bringing back the wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character and will” but that he also lamented how difficult it is to teach this life skill. “The current research,” the researchers concluded, “suggests that perseverance can be taught through role play, a skill that is accessible to even very young children.” Adults too may be wondering if this is something they could try – at the very least it could provide an excuse for wearing a Batman cape to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This installment of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;New on Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; features spectrometry experts at CMP Scientific, Protypia, CovalX, Nightingale Health, and The Scripps Center for Metabolomics. Ready.. set … analyze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Emass-II-Ion-Source-CMP-Scientific.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Emass-II Ion Source CMP Scientific&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-1148&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Emass-II-Ion-Source-CMP-Scientific-300x251.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;CMP Scientific&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Capillary electrophoresis – mass spectrometry (CE-MS) experts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Analytical researchers frustrated by the long separation times, high sample requirements, or low throughput of LC-MS have long been attracted to the advantages of CE-MS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2015, the CE-MS technique was revolutionized — in that year, Brooklyn, New York-based &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CMP Scientific&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; pioneered the EMASS-II CE-MS ion source, a novel interface between the capillary and the mass spectrometer’s electrospray emitter that conferred nanoflow sensitivity and high electrospray efficiency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since then, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CMP Scientific &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has gained a proven track record for helping drug discovery and development companies develop CE-MS methods for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical analysis. Will your research program be the next to benefit from CE-MS technology? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What are the biological effects of the exposome — i.e., the sum of all environmental toxicants, food contaminants and supplements, drugs, and antibiotics your body is exposed to daily? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thanks to XCMS/METLIN, a software combined with a cloud-based database founded by the researchers at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/scripps-center-for-metabolomics&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, investigations into the elusive exposome are now possible. On September 25, the lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945073&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;published the results of their initial study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; — and we were very excited to have such a groundbreaking team join the Science Exchange network!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Natalie Foote, Director of Service Provider Operations, Science Exchange | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OnRamp Bio Logo&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1143&quot; height=&quot;134&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo-1024x229.png&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Tim Wesselman, CEO of today’s featured provider OnRamp Bioinformatics, there are only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onramp.bio/blog/data-management-storage-partnership-announcement&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;15,000 bioinformaticians worldwide today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to support more than 2 million biologists and other researchers. As a result, analysis has become the rate-limiting step in next-generation sequencing studies, and very large datasets may go un-analyzed to the point of obsoletion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To ease this bottleneck, OnRamp Bio offers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;services that empower researchers with insights that they can understand and put into action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Software as a service: accessible bioinformatics for non-experts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OnRamp Bio has made significant progress in making bioinformatics accessible to larger numbers of researchers. Earlier this year, OnRamp Bio launched a new software-as-a-service for RNA-Seq analysis, to meet the needs of researchers needing assistance in making decisions based on the large data sets yielded by RNA-Seq experiments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Genomics big data and complex software analyses have historically required highly trained PhDs in Bioinformatics using complicated command-line tools. OnRamp Bio’s intuitive user interface, automated analyses and robust data management make it faster and easier for scientists, biologists, clinicians and other medical professionals to obtain interpretations of genomic data without the complexity of traditional deployments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“IT complexity has stood in the way of progress for far too long. We’ve combined our deep knowledge of IT and biology to provide intuitive, integrated systems and services that accelerate mainstream adoption of NGS analyses within biotech and pharma,” said Tim Wesselman, CEO of OnRamp Bio. “For institutions focused on drug discovery, cancer research, diagnostic, or therapeutic development, OnRamp Bio can help show how to implement next generation sequencing to securely build into future research, while getting immediate answers more cost-efficiently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In addition to offering end-to-end genomic analysis services, OnRamp Bio recently made the news when it launched Rosalind™, the first-ever software platform specifically designed to simplify genomic analysis (named for one of the researchers who discovered the double helix structure of DNA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Faces of OnRamp Bioinformatics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: In and Out of the Abyss: Depression After Brain Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22942</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/04/in-and-out-of-the-abyss-depression-after-brain-surgery/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Once again I was on the phone to my friend, sobbing. She’d put up with my tears every day since I left the hospital. Two or three daily meltdowns were the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my tears were over things that would have merely irritated me before: misplaced scissors, dirty socks in the middle of the living room, a brief computer glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have cavernous angiomas, tangles of malformed blood vessels, scattered throughout my brain. Two of them—one larger than a golf ball in my right parietal lobe, and the other, smaller, in my brain stem—had bled, and I underwent &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/07/29/heading-into-brain-injury-should-we-be-concerned/&quot;&gt;brain surgeries&lt;/a&gt; to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bleeds and surgeries led to side effects including loss of balance, vertigo, nystagmus, trouble with sensory overload, and a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/&quot;&gt;cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt;. My emotions also seemed volatile. I expected that my emotions would settle down as my brain healed. They didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting up with about a month’s worth of meltdowns, my friend spoke up. “I think you need meds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. The possibility of psychiatric medication had not occurred to me. The people I knew who needed it had major issues: a cousin whose mother had died when she was ten years old, a friend who had been suicidal, a student with bipolar disorder. I wasn’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/&quot;&gt;depressed&lt;/a&gt;. I just got really upset too easily. I was just fragile, and, given what I’d been through, that was understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t in denial over my emotional state. Aware of my extreme vulnerability, I’d been proactive: I’d started seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/15/psychotherapy-and-clinical-boundaries/&quot;&gt;psychotherapist&lt;/a&gt; regularly within days of my return home from the hospital. I had things under control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that brain injury can cause chemical imbalances, which can lead to clinical depression. In one account I read, a patient lamented not having gone on antidepressants sooner. Feeling fortunate that I wasn’t in that bad of shape, I sympathized with those who were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; didn’t need meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, as the tears flowed more often and more freely, my friend grew more insistent. I continued to resist, explaining away my vulnerabilities. It was normal to grieve over losses. I blamed really bad days on my menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the severity and frequency of my meltdowns increased, I had more trouble rationalizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spiraled into the abyss and finally reached the bottom. I felt desolate. I knew I was a burden on everyone around me and that my life wasn’t much of a life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/&quot;&gt;Suicide&lt;/a&gt; seemed logical, perhaps the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept my suicidal thoughts secret—I didn’t want my friend or my therapist to try to talk me out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
Weeks later, when I began to emerge from the abyss, I kept my silence because I felt ashamed, and later still, I added guilt to the shame—I had betrayed the trust of both my friend and my therapist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to rationalize my lie-by-omission: I told myself that I could never really take my life, that I didn’t have it in me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in some corner of my mind there must have been doubt mixed with the rationalization because a few days later I decided to discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; with my therapist. She agreed with my friend: it was time to consider meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the brain bleeds, I was averse to pill popping. I took painkillers for my migraines and antibiotics for bacterial infections—no other medications. After the bleeds, I started taking blood-pressure meds (Verapamil) to cut back on the chances of another bleed and anti-seizure meds (Lamictal). I was concerned about messing with my body chemistry, and worried about drug interactions—I wanted to avoid medications that listed seizures as a possible side effect. Given my concerns, my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who specialized in psychopharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure whether there was a viable solution within my comfort zone, but the answer turned out to be straightforward: the psychiatrist suggested simply increasing my daily dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/08/03/anti-epileptic-drugs-and-the-risk-of-suicide/&quot;&gt;Lamictal&lt;/a&gt;. Anti-seizure meds not only prevent seizures; they also act as mood stabilizers and are often used to combat depression and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist conferred with my neurologist, who, concerned about adverse reactions to the Lamictal, was firm about capping my daily dose at 600 milligrams. My psychiatrist, determining that my depression was severe, decided to increase the dose directly from the 400 milligrams I was on to 600 milligrams, instead of ramping up in increments, which is the standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded well to the increase. Feeling like myself once again, I realized just how badly off I’d been. Like my cousin, my student, and my friend, I too had major issues. Except that I really &lt;i&gt;wasn’t&lt;/i&gt; like them—&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; issues were temporary. Once my brain healed, my depression would be over, and I’d be able to get off the meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a good four years and a couple of trial runs with lowered dosages before I managed to fully shrug off that piece of denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade later, I’m still on antidepressants, for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depression isn’t “situational.” Good friends and therapy help me survive, but they aren’t enough. The bleeds and surgeries changed my neurochemistry. These changes are real, and they’re here to stay. The meds are here to stay, too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fake peer reviews are a problem in academic publishing. A big problem. Many publishers are taking proactive steps to limit the effects, but massive purges of papers tainted by problematic reviews continue to occur; to date, more than 500 papers have been retracted for this reason. In an effort to help, Clarivate Analytics is unveiling a […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Pangolins: the World’s Cutest Creature You’ve Never Heard Of</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/10/04/pangolins-the-worlds-cutest-creature-youve-never-heard-of/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/800px-Pangolin_brought_to_the_Range_office_KMTR_AJTJ-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pangolins are quite possibly the most adorable creatures on the planet. They are mammals (despite being covered in keratin scales), over eighty million years old as a species, and have inquisitive, intelligent personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9550 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;396&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/pangolin-1-300x244.jpg&quot; width=&quot;487&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pangolin has no teeth, and feeds off a diet of mostly insects using their long, thin tongues (longer than the length of their bodies) to probe ant and termite colonies. Pangolins have very few if any natural predators since their scales protect them by withstanding attacks from teeth and claws; a quick YouTube search will show lions trying and failing to eat a round shiny ball, who happily scampers away unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the pangolins have been pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal businesses that market the meat and scales as “magical and medicinal”, and their rarity and cost has made them into a culinary status symbol in East Asian restaurants. This high market value has created a black market where pangolins have been cruelly poached from their natural environments of Africa and Asia to the point that all eight varieties of the pangolin are currently listed as critically endangered. Zoos have thus far been unsuccessful in keeping them, as very little is known about this shy and solitary animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers Zelda du Toit and colleagues at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa have set out to understand more of the mitogenomics of the four African varieties of the Pangolins; Temminck’s ground pangolin (&lt;em&gt;Smutsia temminckii&lt;/em&gt;), the giant ground pangolin (&lt;em&gt;S. gigantea&lt;/em&gt;), the white-bellied pangolin (&lt;em&gt;Phataginus tricuspis&lt;/em&gt;) and black-bellied pangolin (&lt;em&gt;P. tetradactyla&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the full mitochondrial DNA genomes from these specifies and subspecies has been sequenced and verified, researchers will hopefully be able to assist in providing a better understanding of the evolution of pangolins, which in turn will be essential for conservation genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9547 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Phataginus_tricuspis-e1507052502276-300x191.jpg&quot; width=&quot;565&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is well suited for evolutionary studies due to its high mutation rate, well-structured genome with restricted non-coding DNA sequences, and lack of recombination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du Toit and colleagues set out to perform next generation sequencing for all four African pangolins using Illumina HiSeq 2500 in order to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes, two of which have previously not been sequenced; the black-belied pangolin and the giant ground pangolin. Du Toit and her team of researchers have also managed to conduct a phylogenetic assessment in order to provide a genus level classification of African pangolins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using six deceased pangolins which comprised of the four African subspecies, full mitogenomes were generated and aligned with eleven other carnivore genomes using MAFFT v7, as they are reported to be evolutionary closely related to pangolins. The best fit model of sequence evolution for the dataset under the AIC was the General Time Reversal model (GTR+I+G) with invariable site and gamma distribution of 0.822, and the best fit model under the BIC and DT was the Transition model two (TIM2+I+G) with invariable site and gamma distribution values of 0.998 and 0.990, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these two models, three Bayesian phylogenetic trees along with three maximum likelihood trees were generated for the datasets. The different trees all showed consistent branching patterns, posterior probability values for the BI trees and bootstrap values for the ML trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the three trees, a consensus tree was created, as seen in Figure 2 of the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-9552&quot; height=&quot;770&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Pangolin-fig-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1502&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this tree, it can be deduced that all African pangolins group according to the species, with the exception of the black-bellied pangolin genome. That mitogenome has previously been reported to be misclassified based on partial Cob analysis and was confirmed in the analysis as a white-bellied pangolin genome. Additionally, the phylogenetic tree in figure 2 provides support for the separation of Asian and African pangolin species into two distinct monophyletic clades with the latter consisting of all four African pangolins species. Within the clade, the giant and Temminck’s pangolin cluster separately from the white-bellied and black-bellied pangolins with significant Bayesian and ML support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors further go on to claim that the observed branching pattern provides support for the classification of the group-dwelling and arboreal species into two separate genera; &lt;em&gt;Phataginus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smutsia&lt;/em&gt;. Results from their analysis also suggest the overall classification of pangolin should be in three genera: &lt;em&gt;Manis&lt;/em&gt; (Asian pangolins), &lt;em&gt;Phataginus&lt;/em&gt; (African tree pangolins), and &lt;em&gt;Smutsia&lt;/em&gt; (African ground pangolins). However, the authors caution that further analysis of the Asian pangolin genome is necessary. The branching patterns were also confirmed using individual loci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is very unique in that it sheds a light on the diversity of the endangered pangolins remaining in the world. By discovering two new reference genomes for the black bellied pangolin and the giant ground pangolin, researchers will be able to better understand the evolutionary diversity of the extant pangolin species. Additionally, this study offers the first phylogenetic assessment of six of eight species using whole mitochondrial DNA genomes, and the data suggests that the African and Asian pangolin species are indeed separate monophyletic clades, and there is further separation of genera between tree-dwelling and ground-dwelling African pangolins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies are essential for the conservation efforts of this species, and hopefully will be able to help boost dwindling wild pangolin numbers before they go extinct; this species has existed for over 80 million years, and to lose them now would be to lose a very unique and majestic animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys and opinion polls are notoriously bad at predicting election results, as a chain of rather unexpected events last year demonstrated. These instruments usually ask people about their explicit attitudes and opinions. Often, however, these “external” proxies are not entirely representative of what a person is really thinking. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00635.x/abstract&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25956912&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that implicit attitudes – that is, subtle preferences or biases outside the realm of our consciousness – can be more useful in predicting our future choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As scary as this may sound, there is also mounting evidence that our physiological responses can be even more accurate in revealing how we’re likely to vote. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/4111142/Brain-indices-of-disagreement-with-one-s-social&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, researchers from Kingston University and the University of Essex have taken a closer look at a voting outcome in the UK that, last year, came as a surprise to a lot of people. Their findings suggest that people’s brain responses to statements about the EU were a more accurate predictor of they way they went on to vote in the Brexit referendum than their stated intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30917&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the brain’s electrical activity at the scalp, to record a particular brain signal called the N400. These are brainwaves that peak roughly 400ms after a relevant stimulus, such as unexpected words in a sentence (e.g., “I drink my coffee with milk and&lt;i&gt; socks&lt;/i&gt;”), or even violations of our values. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656340&quot;&gt;a particularly illustrative study&lt;/a&gt; found that devout Christians showed a strong N400 signal when reading statements that contradicted their core beliefs (e.g., “I think that euthanasia is an acceptable course of action”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recorded the N400 of 62 participants in the five weeks preceding the UK’s EU referendum last year. All participants were eligible to vote, with 18 intending to vote leave and remain, respectively, and 26 saying they were undecided. The three groups had similar years of education and gender composition, but the leave group (mean age 33.1 years) was significantly older than the remain group (mean age 22.8 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elicit N400 brain waves, participants were exposed to both “remain” (e.g., “Free access to healthcare for all EU migrants should be allowed) and “leave” (e.g., “If Britain leaves Europe our quality of life will be enhanced”) positions. All statements had been retrieved from official material used by both sides of the campaign, and their number was split evenly between the two positions. To make sure that the statements were politically unambiguous, they had been rated by an independent group of participants and only the 112 strongest were retained for the actual experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each statement was presented one word at a time, with each word appearing for 200ms followed by a white screen for 300ms, which is a common set-up for EEG experiments. Participants had to indicate consent or dissent with each statement by pressing a key on a keyboard in front of them. There was a clear-cut difference between agreement and disagreement to statements by “leavers” and “remainers”, showing that the experiment captured political differences reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesised that “leavers” and “remainers” would show higher N400 signal strength in response to statements from the political position opposite to their own. And this is exactly what happened, at least among decided voters.  Participants with the intention to vote leave showed a higher N400 signal to remain- compared to leave-associated statements, while remainers showed the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the authors looked at whether N400 strength was able to predict the actual vote participants casted several weeks later. For this, they contacted the original participants again after the referendum and fed their vote into a statistical model (two participants were excluded because they had not voted in the referendum). And, indeed, the magnitude of the N400 response predicted (i.e. correlated with) the final vote in the referendum. What is even more interesting, this did not depend on whether the participants had already made up their mind when they came in for the EEG measurement. In fact, the N400 brain signal was a significantly better predictor of voting behaviour than participants’ explicit agreement or disagreement with pro- and contra-EU statements. This means that even though participants might not have been explicitly aware of their intentions at the time of the experiment, their brain responses were indicative of them having, in fact, already made up their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of undecided participants, their ultimate vote was to remain (22 out of 25) – which was representative of the London area where they were recruited. This is the study’s main shortcoming because we do not know if N400 would have also predicted voting behaviour among undecided people who went on to vote leave. Still, the study offers some very fascinating insights. It shows that under some circumstances physiological parameters provide a more accurate reflection of personal values and in this case, voting behaviour, than people’s overt opinions. This has crucial implications for opinions polls and surveys, which in the majority of cases rely on explicit information such as agree/disagree responses. On a side note, but no less fascinating than the study’s main results, political information seems to be processed in the brain within as little as 400ms, which is outside our scope of consciousness. This should give pollsters some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/4111142/Brain-indices-of-disagreement-with-one-s-social&quot;&gt;Brain indices of disagreement with one’s social values predict EU referendum voting behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Removing the protein complex cohesin from chromosomes destroys one layer of the genome's 3D structure but leaves another intact. Genome structure is therefore built by independent processes that work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24145&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/ZuSvrF0eXVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: BRCA1–BARD1 promotes RAD51-mediated homologous DNA pairing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24060</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The tumour suppressor complex BRCA1–BARD1 functions in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. During this process, BRCA1–BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumour suppressor complex, BRCA2–PALB2, and the recombinase RAD51. Here, by examining purified wild-type and mutant BRCA1–BARD1, we show that both BRCA1 and BARD1 bind DNA and interact with RAD51, and that BRCA1–BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1–BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-mediated DNA joint formation. We provide evidence that BRCA1 and BARD1 are indispensable for RAD51 stimulation. Notably, BRCA1–BARD1 mutants with weakened RAD51 interactions show compromised DNA joint formation and impaired mediation of homologous recombination and DNA repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1–BARD1 in homologous recombination, an attribute of the tumour suppressor complex that could be targeted in cancer therapy.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP–AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin–cGAS–STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: RNA targeting with CRISPR–Cas13</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 RNA has important and diverse roles in biology, but molecular tools to manipulate and measure it are limited. For example, RNA interference can efficiently knockdown RNAs, but it is prone to off-target effects, and visualizing RNAs typically relies on the introduction of exogenous tags. Here we demonstrate that the class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues, we identified Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity. Catalytically inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding activity, which we leveraged for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells. Our results establish CRISPR–Cas13a as a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian cells and therapeutic development.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Hippo pathway deficiency reverses systolic heart failure after infarction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24045</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Mammalian organs vary widely in regenerative capacity. Poorly regenerative organs, such as the heart are particularly vulnerable to organ failure. Once established, heart failure commonly results in mortality. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that prevents adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration, is upregulated in human heart failure. Here we show that deletion of the Hippo pathway component Salvador (Salv) in mouse hearts with established ischaemic heart failure after myocardial infarction induces a reparative genetic program with increased scar border vascularity, reduced fibrosis, and recovery of pumping function compared with controls. Using translating ribosomal affinity purification, we isolate cardiomyocyte-specific translating messenger RNA. Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes have increased expression of proliferative genes and stress response genes, such as the mitochondrial quality control gene, Park2. Genetic studies indicate that Park2 is essential for heart repair, suggesting a requirement for mitochondrial quality control in regenerating myocardium. Gene therapy with a virus encoding Salv short hairpin RNA improves heart function when delivered at the time of infarct or after ischaemic heart failure following myocardial infarction was established. Our findings indicate that the failing heart has a previously unrecognized reparative capacity involving more than cardiomyocyte renewal.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cancer drug addiction is relayed by an ERK2-dependent phenotype switch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24037</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5VDXmS2r-Z8/nature24037</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Observations from cultured cells, animal models and patients raise the possibility that the dependency of tumours on the therapeutic drugs to which they have acquired resistance represents a vulnerability with potential applications in cancer treatment. However, for this drug addiction trait to become of clinical interest, we must first define the mechanism that underlies it. We performed an unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 knockout screen on melanoma cells that were both resistant and addicted to inhibition of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, in order to functionally mine their genome for ‘addiction genes’. Here we describe a signalling pathway comprising ERK2 kinase and JUNB and FRA1 transcription factors, disruption of which allowed addicted tumour cells to survive on treatment discontinuation. This occurred in both cultured cells and mice and was irrespective of the acquired drug resistance mechanism. In melanoma and lung cancer cells, death induced by drug withdrawal was preceded by a specific ERK2-dependent phenotype switch, alongside transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In melanoma cells, this reprogramming caused the shutdown of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a lineage survival oncoprotein; restoring this protein reversed phenotype switching and prevented the lethality associated with drug addiction. In patients with melanoma that had progressed during treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, which is associated with the phenotype switch. Drug discontinuation synergized with the melanoma chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine by further suppressing MITF and its prosurvival target, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and by inducing DNA damage in cancer cells. Our results uncover a pathway that underpins drug addiction in cancer cells, which may help to guide the use of alternating therapeutic strategies for enhanced clinical responses in drug-resistant cancers.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A viral Sm-class RNA base-pairs with mRNAs and recruits microRNAs to inhibit apoptosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a γ-herpesvirus that establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs (HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA–RNA crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53 signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA processing.

 Nature uses a limited, conservative set of amino acids to synthesize proteins. The ability to genetically encode an expanded set of building blocks with new chemical and physical properties is transforming the study, manipulation and evolution of proteins, and is enabling diverse applications, including approaches to probe, image and control protein function, and to precisely engineer therapeutics. Underpinning this transformation are strategies to engineer and rewire translation. Emerging strategies aim to reprogram the genetic code so that noncanonical biopolymers can be synthesized and evolved, and to test the limits of our ability to engineer the translational machinery and systematically recode genomes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: TORC1 organized in inhibited domains (TOROIDs) regulate TORC1 activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and metabolism. GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The transcription fidelity factor GreA impedes DNA break repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Homologous recombination repairs DNA double-strand breaks and must function even on actively transcribed DNA. Because break repair prevents chromosome loss, the completion of repair is expected to outweigh the transcription of broken templates. However, the interplay between DNA break repair and transcription processivity is unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor GreA inhibits break repair in Escherichia coli. GreA restarts backtracked RNA polymerase and hence promotes transcription fidelity. We report that removal of GreA results in markedly enhanced break repair via the classic RecBCD–RecA pathway. Using a deep-sequencing method to measure chromosomal exonucleolytic degradation, we demonstrate that the absence of GreA limits RecBCD-mediated resection. Our findings suggest that increased RNA polymerase backtracking promotes break repair by instigating RecA loading by RecBCD, without the influence of canonical Chi signals. The idea that backtracked RNA polymerase can stimulate recombination presents a DNA transaction conundrum: a transcription fidelity factor that compromises genomic integrity.

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Work will use state of the art imaging techniques to provide new insights critical for addressing numerous visual, neurological, and psychiatric disorders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Fitzpatrick, Scientific Director and CEO at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has been awarded a $2 million four-year grant from the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the functional organization of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex, specifically, in the area of brain responsible for processing visual information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is the largest and most complex area of the brain, comprising 20 billion neurons and 60 trillion synapses–a neuronal network whose proper function is critical for sensory perception, motor control, and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the research supported by this grant, we aim to address a major gap in our understanding of how neurons in the cerebral cortex process information,” said Dr. Fitzpatrick. “A deeper understanding of how neural circuits develop and work together to process and transmit information is crucial for addressing numerous visual, neurological, and psychiatric disorders resulting from the dysfunction of these circuits in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since MPFI opened its doors in 2012, its scientists have received over $20 million dollars in NIH funding in support of its innovative and pioneering neuroscience research, including a $177k fellowship from the NEI recently awarded to Dr. Joseph Schumacher, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. David Fitzpatrick’s lab. &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A researcher who co-authored a paper about violent video games that was retracted earlier this year appears to have changed positions, according to her website. After her PhD was revoked by The Ohio State in August, Jodi Whitaker’s listed position at the University of Arizona changed from “assistant professor” to “lecturer.” The page also has […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A new paper in Nature Human Behaviour has generated lots of debate. In Redefine Statistical Significance, authors Daniel J. Benjamin and colleagues suggest changing the convention that p-values below 0.05 are called 'significant'. Instead, they suggest, the cut-off should be set at 0.005 - a stricter criterion.



Over at The Brains Blog, John Schwenkler organized a discussion of the Benjamin et al. proposal, featuring commentary from several statisticians and researchers.

&lt;p&gt;There are behavioural differences, on average, between the sexes – few would dispute that. Where the debate rages is over how much these differences are the result of social pressures versus being rooted in our biology (the answer often is that there is a complex interaction between the two).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when differences are observed between girls and boys, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;preferences for play&lt;/a&gt;, one possibility is that this is partly or wholly because of the contrasting ways that girls and boys are influenced by their peers, parents and other adults (because of the ideas they have about how the sexes ought to behave). Studying non-human primates allows us to identity sex differences in behavior that can’t be due to human culture and gender beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning more about the biological roots of behavioural sex differences should not be used as an excuse for harmful stereotyping or discrimination, but it can help us better understand our human nature and the part that evolved sex differences play in some of the most important issues that affect our lives, including around diversity, relationships, mental health, crime and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, as part of a special issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience Research – &lt;/em&gt;titled “An Issue Whose Time Has Come: Sex/Gender Influences on Nervous System Function” – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elizabeth-lonsdorf.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;enhanced-author e7f4b551-07bb-48a5-9a6f-26b737f6f8dc enhanced-underline-draw hover current-selection active&quot;&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;enhanced-author e7f4b551-07bb-48a5-9a6f-26b737f6f8dc enhanced-underline-draw hover current-selection active&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elizabeth-lonsdorf.com&quot;&gt;Lonsdorf&lt;/a&gt; at Franklin and Marshall College published &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.23862/full&quot;&gt;a useful mini-review detailing some of the sex differences observed among monkey and ape infants and juveniles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human cultures across the world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;amp;context=psychfacpub&quot;&gt;boys tend to spend more time away from their mothers&lt;/a&gt; as compared with girls, which may reflect an early tendency toward greater risk taking. The same is true in chimps. For a 2014 paper, Lonsdorf and her colleagues, including famed zoologist Jane Goodall, conducted &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099099#&quot;&gt;the most detailed ever analysis of the development of wild chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, observing 40 chimps from birth to age 5. They found that, by age 3, male infants showed greater physical distance from their mothers than females. The males began moving about on their own earlier than females and covered more distances independently. These and other findings from the study “suggest that some biologically based sex differences in behavior may have been present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, and operated independently from the influences of modern sex-biased parental behavior and gender socialization,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baby girl monkeys are more social &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, girls tend to show more precocious social interest and development than boys. For example, at less than two-days old, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638300000321&quot;&gt;girls spend more time than boys looking at a human face than at a mechanical toy&lt;/a&gt;. Though a replication attempt of this specific finding for humans is needed, a very similar pattern has been found in rhesus macaque monkeys. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726418/&quot;&gt;a paper published last year&lt;/a&gt; a research team led by Elizabeth Simpson observed 48 two- to three-week old monkeys as they were presented with videos of a macaque monkey face. The females spent more time looking at the videos than males and they later displayed more social behaviour toward a human. “In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life, and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy monkeys enjoy more rough and tumble &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human children, average sex differences in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/10/why-pink-lego-might-be-bad-for-girls/&quot;&gt;preferences&lt;/a&gt; are among the most striking, consistent (and controversial) behavioural contrasts found between boys and girls. It never seems to take very long for little boys to pick up sticks and pretend that they are armed with a sword. In contrast, girls typically spend more time pretending to nurture toy dolls or similar. Of course, many say this simply reflects the way that boys are raised to be more aggressive and girls more nurturing. And yet very similar sex-linked play preferences are seen in our primate cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

Males also initiated play more often than females. In her review, Lonsdorf notes that similar findings have been observed in blue monkeys, patas monkeys, Japanese macaques and olive baboons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Girl monkeys spend more time playing parent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1128681?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;Human boys, on average, are less interested than girls in babies&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a similar pattern among non-human primates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03327332&quot;&gt;Observational research&lt;/a&gt; at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center with one-year-old Rhesus Macaque monkeys found that the females spent significantly more time than the males with infants. “The focus of young females’ attention on infants has been suggested to be important for the development of later maternal skills,” the researchers said. They noted that a similar observation has been found for another species: “Juvenile female vervet monkeys that live in the wild carry and cuddle small infants, an experience that may provide them with the motor skills necessary for later matemal behavior, as weIl as give them exposure to the maternal role. It is likely that this experience is similarly useful for a yearling rhesus monkey”. Lonsdorf observes in her review that a female bias for nurturing style play has also been seen in lowland gorillas and blue monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boy monkeys like learning from their dads, girl monkeys from their mums&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little doubt that biological differences between the sexes are amplified by parenting practices and parent-child relationships, including boys’ tendency to want to emulate their dads and girls to emulate their mothers – as seen both in humans and our primate cousins. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728904/&quot;&gt;in a study of capuchin monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, Susan Perry looked to see whether infants adopted one of two different techniques (pounding or scrubbing) for extracting seeds from fruit – girls, but not boys, typically adopted whichever technique was used by their mothers. In wild tufted capuchins, meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20120/abstract&quot;&gt;male juveniles typically stick with their dads and copy their dietary preferences&lt;/a&gt;, such as favouring eating animals over fruit (the latter preferred by females). It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205001831&quot;&gt;a similar story for chimps and termite fishing&lt;/a&gt; with research showing how females are better at this task than males and that female infants spend more time than their boy peers watching and learning from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken as a whole,” Lonsdorf concludes, “these consistent and accumulating reports of sex differences in primate behavioral development suggest that, although gender socialization in humans plays a role in magnifying the differences between young males and females, these behavioral sex differences are rooted in our biological and evolutionary heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation is to improve health by “accelerating support for medical research through recognition of research excellence, education and advocacy.” Each year, Lasker Awards are given to scientists that embody this mission. Organizations are also eligible for awards through the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that alternates years with the Lasker~Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7762&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7762 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/10/Sommer-Jacket-Square-5x5-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Dr. Alfred Sommer; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s recipient of the Public Service Award is Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), “for providing essential health services and reproductive care to millions of women for more than a century.” PPFA began in Brooklyn, New York, where in 1916 Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the US; in 1942 the organization changed its name from The American Birth Control League to Planned Parenthood. To place the 2017 Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award in context, PLOS interviewed Chair of the Jury &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/scholarships/institutional-scholarships/sommer-scholars/about/alfred-sommer-bio.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfred Sommer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, University Distinguished Service Professor and Dean Emeritus, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this award, PPFA joins other collaborative efforts including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-receives-lasker-bloomberg-public-service-award&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Lasker-Bloomberg-Award-Acceptance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cc.nih.gov/ccaward.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as Lasker Public Service Awardees. Since recent previous awardees in this category were individuals, PLOS asked Sommer what does this say about how science and medicine work today, or about the efforts needed to impact human health. &lt;strong&gt;“The intent of the Public Service Award has always been recognition of contributions to expanding investments in biomedical/health research and advancing the public’s health,”&lt;/strong&gt; he responds. “In recent years there has been slightly greater attention paid to the latter, and therefore to the individuals and institutions that have made a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sommer was circumspect and honest when asked to reflect on the timing of the committee’s decision process, in relation to political discourse in the US at that time over the proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that would defund approximately 40% of Planned Parenthood’s annual budget. “The discussion is always free-wheeling, and every member is free to raise whatever perspectives they like,” he says. “I am not at liberty to discuss the actual vote, but I can say there was broad agreement with this year’s choice (as there usually is every year, once the discussion and votes are taken).” He continues that the Lasker Awards are “meant to recognize extraordinary achievements, and bring these achievements to the attention of the public. It was no different in this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of Planned Parenthood is fascinating. While family planning may be the founding service, it’s likely the public doesn’t realize the breadth of services offered by the organization, from sex education programs that reach 1.5 million people annually to over 4 million tests and treatments to both men and women (in 2015 alone) for sexually transmitted infections. “The purpose of all Lasker Awards is to better inform the public about the individual, work, and organization that is being honored,” says Sommer. In recognizing PPFA, he continues, “we would hope that the public will have a better understanding of all the contributions to health made by PPFA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While publications and publicity are not a requirement for receipt of the Public Service Award, placing this type of information into the public domain helps to inform policy and to improve health outcomes. Among the PLOS journals, two articles have corresponding or contributing authors affiliated with PPFA. In the recent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parents’ views on sex education in schools: How much do Democrats and Republicans agree?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” researchers from Planned Parenthood found that comprehensive sex education is supported by a vast majority of parents, both Democrats and Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;article, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002110&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comparison of Outcomes before and after Ohio’s Law Mandating Use of the FDA-Approved Protocol for Medication Abortion: A Retrospective Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” researchers followed outcomes of a law that took effect in 2011 requiring abortion providers to follow specific US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, created in 2000, when giving patients a combination of two drugs to induce abortion. Their findings, covered by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/ohio-abortion-pill-law-mifepristone-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-abortion-complications-ohio-20160830-snap-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, indicate that women experienced a higher rate of complications and were nearly three times more likely to require additional medical intervention after the law was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that receiving a Lasker Award hints at prediction of a Nobel Prize. To put this attention to awards and prizes in context, it’s worth understanding the compelling origins and motivations of the Lasker Foundation directly from “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Lasker Legacy&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;video. After watching you might want to make your voice heard through suggested resources on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/march-for-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Stand Up for Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; webpage. Work from individual scientists receiving this year’s Lasker Awards is described &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/09/2017-lasker-awards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: New Fibromyalgia Treatment: Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22957</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/02/new-fibromyalgia-treatment-emotional-awareness-and-expression-therapy/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychotherapy that encourages addressing emotional experiences related to trauma, conflict, and relationship problems has been found helpful for people with the chronic pain condition fibromyalgia.In the randomized clinical trial at Wayne State University in Detroit, 230 adults with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/31/new-treatment-option-for-difficult-diseases/&quot;&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/a&gt; received one of three treatments. Each was presented for eight weekly sessions to small groups of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new therapy, called Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), helps patients view their pain and other symptoms as stemming from changeable neural pathways in the brain that are strongly influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/22/comparing-the-5-theories-of-emotion/&quot;&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EAET helps patients process emotional experiences, such as disclosing important struggles, learning how to adaptively express important feelings—especially anger and sadness, but also &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/26/learning-how-to-practice-being-grateful-and-reap-the-benefits/&quot;&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt;, compassion, and forgiveness—and empowering people to be more honest and direct in relationships that have been conflicted or problematic, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EAET intervention was compared to both an educational intervention, as well as the gold standard psychological approach in the field, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/&quot;&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Six months after treatments ended, patients were evaluated for the severity and extent of their pain and other problems that people with fibromyalgia often experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who received EAET had better outcomes—reduced widespread &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/27/neurofeedback-therapy-for-the-management-of-pain/&quot;&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, physical impairment, attention and concentration problems, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/14/got-anxiety-got-smarts/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and more positive emotions and life satisfaction—than patients who received the education intervention, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than twice as many people in EAET (34.8 percent) reported that they were “much better” or “very much better” than before treatment, compared to 15.4 percent of education patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important additional finding was that the new emotion therapy also had greater benefits than cognitive behavior therapy in reducing widespread pain and in the number of patients who achieved at least 50 percent pain reduction, the researchers point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark A. Lumley, Ph.D., a professor of psychology said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with fibromyalgia have experienced adversity in their lives, including victimization, family problems, and internal conflicts, all of which create important emotions that are often suppressed or avoided. Emerging neuroscience research suggests that this can contribute strongly to pain and other physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed and tested an approach that tries to help people overcome these emotional and relationship problems and reduce their symptoms, rather than just help people manage or accept their fibromyalgia. Although this treatment does not help all people with fibromyalgia, many patients found it to be very helpful, and some had dramatic improvements in their lives and their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wayne State researchers collaborated with a team of researchers from the University of Michigan Medical Center led by David A. Williams, Ph.D., a professor of anesthesiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PAIN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
