	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Corey Moran &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching Dr. Christian Wurm boot up the Imspector software for the very first time filled me with a mixture of fascination and trepidation. At first glance, Abberior’s software interface for the STED microscope is reminiscent of a pilot’s cockpit; blinking lights, snippets of recognizable phrases, and a multitude of virtual buttons all laid out in a seemingly organized, but completely unfamiliar fashion. I continued to watch as he masterfully navigated through the myriad of submenus, adjusting this and that to his liking and preparing the microscope for the day’s imaging. It struck me in that moment that Dr. Wurm, the CEO of Aberrior Instruments America, would only be here to train us for one week. In that short time, I needed to become a proficient helmsman of this foreign vessel. Daunting? By all means, yes, but I was excited to take on the challenge and add another piece of microscopy to my arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering now who the “me” is in this story. Hello to everyone reading, my name is Corey Moran and I am a graduate of the University of Florida with a degree in microbiology and cell science, with an emphasis in neuroscience. I had the good fortune to intern in Dr. Ryohei Yasuda’s lab two summers during my undergraduate work and two years now full time. MPFI served as my first foray into neurobiological research and what an incredible experience it has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in Dr. Yasuda’s lab at MPFI, I have become versed in microscopy techniques ranging from 2-photon to FLIM-FRET to confocal. These imaging techniques, which I can only describe as simply elegant, provide a novel avenue to the inner working and function of the complex tapestry of cells that comprise the human brain. In Dr. Yasuda’s lab, the main focus of research involves the study of the intricate symphony of signaling proteins that interact during the process of learning and memory. To study these neurological events, we look directly at a protein’s behavior during the physiological process called synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of a synapse (communicational connections between neurons) to change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically using the STED, I have been working my colleague, Dr. Jie Wang, who has been studying a particular endosomal protein. Research has established the critical importance of this protein as it relates to the packaging and shipping of cellular material within brain cells. An important new discovery made by Dr. Wang takes us one view deeper into the multifunctional roles that proteins play. Her research shows that the protein in question attenuates the process of synaptic plasticity, acting as a molecular brake. This action slows the process of learning and memory for reasons that are not yet fully clear. Once we learned of the protein’s particularly unique role, the next logical step was to investigate the region of the cell where its biological effect is exhibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Confocal_STED_Endosomes.jpg&amp;amp;quot&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Confocal_STED_Endosomes.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;STED super resolution localization of a small GTPase protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endosome is a dense and complex intracellular network that is responsible for packaging and shipping cellular cargo like proteins, lipids and other macromolecules all throughout the cell. This network is difficult to study due to the fact that it consists of varying types of unique mini-compartments. Our protein in question could associate with any number of these smaller compartments or even reside in multiple locations. The size of these endosomal compartments can be well under the 200nm resolution limit of traditional light microscopy. So to parse this information out, we needed the superior resolution that only the STED could provide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are embarking on a set of co-localization studies. These types of studies involve looking at hundreds of neurons to see if our protein of interest resides in the same locations of other previously identified proteins within the cell. Uncovering this piece of the puzzle will provide a greater understanding of the protein’s location within this network. Knowing the location, we can then extrapolate what type of function our protein may have based on the identified functions of the compartment itself and what other proteins also localize to it. This information will ultimately give us a more complete picture of how this protein contributes to the overall process of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, I am utilizing the STED to validate research tools to study a secondary protein that looks to be critically involved in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer’s disease. My work in conjunction with my mentor Dr. Erzsebet Szatmari is still in the very preliminary stages. Hopefully, this work will lead to disease relevant discoveries as our experiments progress.&lt;br /&gt;
The intersection of super-resolution microscopy and neuroscience is a relatively new phenomenon and a frontier where only the surface has been scratched. The capability of super-resolution microscopy will continue to develop and expand exponentially in the very near future. One of the most exciting goals is to dynamically fuse these two highly specialized fields in order to study complex neuronal functions, such as synaptic plasticity, in real time with nanoscale, crystal clear resolution. Currently, at MPFI, we are working on just that, pushing our optics further into the future to make an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Belief in our moral superiority is the most irrational self-enhancing bias of all</title>

&lt;p&gt;Most of us believe we are smarter, harder-working and better at driving than average. Clearly we can’t all be right. When it comes to moral qualities, like honesty and trustworthiness, our sense of personal superiority is so inflated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/10/jailed-criminals-think-they-are-kinder-more-trustworthy-and-honest-than-the-average-member-of-the-public/&quot;&gt;even jailed criminals consider themselves to be more moral than law-abiding citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should the “better-than-average” effect be so pronounced for moral traits? In new work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081899?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ben Tappin and Ryan McKay at Royal Holloway, University of London have found that it’s because we’re especially irrational when it comes to evaluating moral traits. Moral superiority appears to be “a uniquely strong and prevalent form of positive illusion,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32803&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tappin and McKay showed a list of 30 traits to 270 participants. Ten traits related to sociability (like being sociable, cooperative, rude or uptight); ten to agency (like being determined, creative, unmotivated or illogical) and ten to morality (like being principled, fair, manipulative or deceptive). They asked the participants to rate how much each trait applied to them and to the “average person”, and to rate the desirability of the traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the participants gave themselves higher scores than they gave the “average person” for almost all the desirable traits (being sociable was a notable exception), and lower scores for the undesirable traits. They were, as the researchers expected, guilty of “self-enhancement”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you really are a particularly high or low scorer on certain traits, self-enhancement isn’t necessarily irrational. We tend to be less certain about what other people are like, compared with ourselves, which means it sometimes makes sense to form less extreme judgements about their scores. As the researchers noted: “Perceived differences between ourselves and other people may even reflect rationally cautious judgements, made under uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore to what extent the participants’ self-enhancement was rational or irrational, Tappin and McKay factored in how typical their scores were, overall, compared with the average. For instance, if across the board an individual’s personality is very average, and this shows up in most of their self-ratings, it looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;irrational&lt;/i&gt; self-enhancement if on a given desirable trait they tend to inflate their own scores relative to the “average person”. In contrast, for someone whose personality is overall more atypical, there’s arguably more &lt;i&gt;rational&lt;/i&gt; justification for them to infer that they are more extreme than average on various traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this logic, the researchers found that self-enhancement pertaining to sociability was mostly quite rational. Self-enhancement related to agency (being intelligent, determined and so on) was less rational. Least justified of all, or most irrational, was moral self-enhancement. “Virtually all individuals irrationally inflated their moral qualities, and the absolute and relative magnitude of this irrationality was greater than that in the other domains of positive self-evaluation,” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the prevailing theory of self-serving positive illusions, we hold inaccurate, overly rosy views of ourselves because they make us feel better about ourselves, and so boost our psychological wellbeing. Consistent with this, in the current study, greater irrational social and agency self-enhancement was correlated with having more self-esteem. Intriguingly, however, irrational moral superiority was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study can’t explain why we are most irrational when it comes to downplaying other people’s moral qualities compared with our own, which was a surprise to the researchers. But there could be an evolutionary reason: from a survival perspective, the safe bet is to assume someone is less trustworthy than you, unless you know otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work could explore this. And, as the researchers also noted in their paper, it’s important to dig into our inflated beliefs that we’re just, virtuous and moral in part because these kinds of beliefs – in contrast to inflated ideas about our own determination, say, or cooperativeness – “likely contribute to the severity of human conflict. When opposing sides are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/28/psychologists-went-to-war-torn-northern-iraq-to-find-out-why-some-fighters-will-sacrifice-everything-for-their-cause/&quot;&gt;convinced of their own righteousness&lt;/a&gt;,” the researches noted, “escalation of violence is more probable, and the odds of resolution are ominously low”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641986/&quot;&gt;The Illusion of Moral Superiority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Faster than a human possibly could, machine-learning approaches can analyze data, metadata and text content; find structural similarities between research problems in unrelated fields; and synthesize content from thousands of articles to suggest directions for further research explorations. In consideration of the continually expanding volume of peer-reviewed literature, the value of TDM should not be underappreciated. Text and data mining is a useful tool for developing new scientific insights and new ways to understand the story told by the published literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Application and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have leveraged text mining of abstracts and NCBI databases to advance precision medicine through discovery of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disease-gene-variant relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, employed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156031&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;text mining of journal articles for sleep disorder terminologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to determine publication trends, and used text mining to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108847&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cluster and relationship-map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; BioMed Central journal content. A study &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/11/162099.article-info&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted on bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; found that text mining full articles gave significantly better information that mining abstracts only, as expected. However, the authors of this study &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/want-analyze-millions-scientific-papers-all-once-here-s-best-way-do-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the way content was presented and in the need to obtain copyright permissions. In addition to content availability and license status, support for early adopters and training for future practitioners are also cited as barriers to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futuretdm.eu/blog/europe-can-stimulate-text-data-mining/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;broad use of TDM for research purposes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The foundational value of CC BY licensing for TDM is that no additional permissions or documentation are required. Open Access facilitates TDM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not on case-by-case basis, but for all people, in all places, and at all times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without lengthy legal agreements or restrictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by providing unrestricted reuse, remix and mining rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;No Restrictions, No Conditions: allofPLOS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 200,000 fully Open Access research articles available for content mining, PLOS can help advance the discussion and application of content mining through real-world experiences. Through our API we provide article text and meta-data in a single XML file format according to the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS), the National Information Standards Organization (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niso.org/home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NISO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) standard tag suite for archiving and exchanging journal article content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new allofPLOS project is a step forward in providing researchers easier opportunities for new discovery and illumination of non-obvious connections between data, research articles and fields of study. With allofPLOS, in addition to the content of every PLOS article (excluding Figures or Supplemental Data) provided in JATS XML format, the XML parsing tools are provided. By including tags, content and parsing tools together, we hope to simplify and streamline the process for those wanting to experiment with content mining and TDM tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With content mining, scientists, educators, policymakers and others can identify and map patterns and trends across millions of articles, extract the information they want, and gain new insights to advance research. TDM results can be shared as a new research article or as a database for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setting the Stage for a Text and Data Mining Future&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support policies and public awareness that TDM for research purposes is compatible with current and future publishing industry practices, in 2015 PLOS participated in construction of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehaguedeclaration.com/the-hague-declaration-on-knowledge-discovery-in-the-digital-age/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hague Declaration on Knowledge Discovery in the Digital Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a set of five core principles and a roadmap for action to enable researchers to carry out TDM of digital content on the web without legal repercussions. Unrestricted access to the scientific literature together with standards that promote machine readability of the facts, data and ideas contained within ensures that journal content is available for maximum discovery and reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are producing so much information, not just as published literature but as even data from sensors, from monitoring activities, monitoring the planet, and monitoring species, and living things and nonliving things it is simply not humanely possible to attract full value from this, let alone value that we don’t even know that exists inside it,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Puneet Kishor, former Science and Data Policy Manager, Creative Commons, in a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehaguedeclaration.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video on The Hague Declaration website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Using computers and machines is the only way programmatically to figure out what’s hidden inside,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter: “When did you know she [Meghan Markle] was the one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry: “The very first time we met”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a trope of Hollywood: when two people realise in an instant that they have met the one they want to spend the rest of their lives with. In reality too, happy long-term couples will tell you, perhaps a little too smugly, and doing that gazing into each other’s eyes thing, how it was simply “love at first sight”. Mutual, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry to spoil the mood music, but a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12218/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt; – one of the first attempts to study this phenomenon scientifically – concludes that while believing one has fallen instantly in love does seem to be a genuine experience, it’s not really about love at all, but more to do with physical attraction (and it’s rarely mutual). And while people who remember having fallen in love with their partner at first sight do describe their relationship as more passionate in the present, their recall is probably little more than a “confabulated memory” – a “projection of their current feelings into the past”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32798&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new evidence, collected by Florian Zsok and her colleagues at the University of Groningen, comes from a mix of studies involving a total of 396 participants, about 60 per cent of them women, mostly heterosexual, young Dutch and German students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zsok’s team recruited the majority of the participants via an online survey: they answered questions about their current romantic relationship, if they were in one, and they looked at pictures of several potential partners (people they’d never met before) and rated their attraction to them, any feelings of love, including intimacy, passion and commitment, which are the different components of the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-26/edition-2/searching-love&quot;&gt;triangular theory of love&lt;/a&gt;“, and also “eros”, which is measured by items like “I feel that the person and I were meant for each other”. Crucially, participants also stated whether they agreed that “I am experiencing love at first sight”. A similar process was performed by more participants who attended a psych lab where they looked at pictures of potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other studies involved speed dating exercises in which potential partners met each other for 90 minutes in one case, or 20 minutes in another. As with the online survey and lab study, these participants answered questions about feelings of attraction towards their dates, any experience of love at first sight, and other feelings of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the studies, 32 participants (more often men) described 49 experiences of love at first sight, either toward a pictured potential partner, or toward someone they met at one of the speed dating sessions. Experiencing love at first sight wasn’t accompanied by particularly strong ratings of any of the different kinds of love, including passion or intimacy, but was strongly associated with finding the other person highly attractive. Indeed, a one-point increase on the 5-point attraction scale (from finding them “not at all” physically attractive to “very much”) was associated with a nine-fold increased likelihood of reporting love at first sight. At the speed dating events, none of the instances of love at first sight was reciprocal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To conclude,” the researchers write, “our findings suggest that love at first sight reported at actual first sight resembles neither passionate love nor love more generally.” Rather, they believe love at first sight is “a strong initial attraction that some label as ‘love at first sight’ – either retrospectively or in the moment of first sight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the participants who were currently in a relationship and who said they’d fallen in love with their partner at first sight, did tend to describe their current relationship in more passionate terms (than others who didn’t say they fell in love at first sight). But Zsok and her team say that rather than love at first sight laying the foundations for more passionate relationships, the “more scientific explanation might be that people project their current feelings into the past”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a particularly romantic paper, but then again, it may have inspired a coming together or sorts: romantics and sceptics will likely be united in their doubts about this research. Rating pictures of potential partners on a computer screen (which was the basis of much of the new evidence) hardly captures the reality of that magical moment when time stands still and you realise he or she is your everything. The speed dating studies were a little more realistic, but by definition they are contrived, and only 50 people participated in this part of the research. It will take more than this to stop many of us believing in romantic fairytales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scientifically informed public is a wonderful thing, and at the Digest we’re happy to be part of cultivating it. But we’d be the first to admit that many scientific issues are too complex for a single article to resolve decisively. When it comes to making consequential life decisions, it’s still important to defer to experts who can draw nuanced conclusions from looking at the big picture. But experts are increasingly denigrated, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963662516680311&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Public Understanding of Science&lt;/i&gt; suggests that one cause may be our easy access to information, giving us the impression that we already know all we need. Specifically, science reporting that is accessible, breezy and details-light can discourage readers from consulting experts on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32793&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Scharrer of the University of Münster and her colleagues recruited 73 German participants (average age of 34) with a range of educational backgrounds. They read a booklet containing four scenarios in which a hypothetical friend had a health issue and wanted to know the veracity of a claim, for instance: “does eating chillies decrease blood pressure?”. Each scenario was followed by a genuine research-based article about a relevant medical science finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These research articles had been published between 2007-2011 and were reproduced verbatim. Their original place of publication was hidden from participants, but two of the articles in the booklet were always from a source aimed at experts, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springermedizin.de/&quot;&gt;Springer Medizin&lt;/a&gt; (similar to the English language site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medscape.com/&quot;&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt;). These were digested accounts of peer-reviewed articles that retained some technical nitty-gritty. The other two articles were always from a mainstream press source such as the popular German tabloid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.de&quot;&gt;Bild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated both types of text as credible, and both types increased their faith in the scientific claim queried by their friend. However, participants agreed more with scientific claims that were backed up by an article from the mainstream press, compared to a digest aimed at experts. What’s more, after reading a mainstream science article, participants were more confident in their understanding of the issue, and although they admitted they weren’t yet 100 per cent confident, they were less likely to say they needed to consult an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharrer’s team believe that when we read technical scientific accounts, the jargon and depth remind us of the complexity of the topic. But when the account is too easy to swallow, we feel on top of the issue – we reason that it can’t be that complex because we understand it already. This “fluency effect”, where information that’s very easy to process gives you the impression you’re on top of that topic, is known to be triggered in other contexts, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/05/14/engaging-lecturers-can-breed-overconfidence/breed-overconfidence/&quot;&gt;by lectures from engaging speakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings like these pose a dilemma to science communicators – do too good a job and you risk leaving your audience with an inflated sense of confidence. To our mind, the benefit of making science accessible to as many people as possible – while remaining accurate – is too important to sacrifice. But this new research is a reminder that it’s always important to alert readers to the caveats and limitations behind new findings, and that science is a messy process – after all, what’s scientifically supported today may turn out to be false tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963662516680311&quot;&gt;When science becomes too easy: Science popularization inclines laypeople to underrate their dependence on experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Promoter-bound METTL3 maintains myeloid leukaemia by m6A-dependent translation control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24678</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/bNzUJc14QVg/nature24678</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification in both coding and non-coding RNAs that is catalysed by the METTL3–METTL14 methyltransferase complex. However, the specific role of these enzymes in cancer is still largely unknown. Here we define a pathway that is specific for METTL3 and is implicated in the maintenance of a leukaemic state. We identify METTL3 as an essential gene for growth of acute myeloid leukaemia cells in two distinct genetic screens. Downregulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of leukaemic cells and failure to establish leukaemia in immunodeficient mice. We show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and localizes to the transcriptional start sites of active genes. The vast majority of these genes have the CAATT-box binding protein CEBPZ present at the transcriptional start site, and this is required for recruitment of METTL3 to chromatin. Promoter-bound METTL3 induces m6A modification within the coding region of the associated mRNA transcript, and enhances its translation by relieving ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way are necessary for acute myeloid leukaemia. Together, these data define METTL3 as a regulator of a chromatin-based pathway that is necessary for maintenance of the leukaemic state and identify this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukaemia.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Marijuana And Sexual Dysfunction — Could Your Marijuana Usage Be Hindering Your Performance in Bed?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23108</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/26/marijuana-and-sexual-dysfunction-could-your-marijuana-usage-be-hindering-your-performance-in-bed/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is marijuana?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Marijuana, also called pot, cannabis, weed, reefer, Mary Jane, dope, broccoli, chronic, reefer, and 420, among countless others, consists of a mixture of dried plant leaves, flowers, and/or stems of the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis Sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant. In addition, there is a resin-based version of marijuana that is called hash. Most people either smoke marijuana or vape it (warming it, but not cooking it), but it can also be ingested in oil form. The most common way to ingest marijuana is to roll it up and smoke it like you would a cigarette or cigar, or use a smoking tool like a pipe. Some users, however, consume weed by infusing foods (i.e., butter and cooking oil) or teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens to your body when you ingest marijuana?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/26/cannabinoids-hold-promise-for-alzheimers-disease-treatment/&quot;&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the most active ingredient in marijuana. When you smoke this herb, it travels to your lungs before entering your bloodstream. Once in your blood, it travels to your brain and other organs (i.e., heart, tissues, etc.). FYI: Drinking or eating marijuana can delay the effects of THC. But, once it bonds with your brain’s neural receptors you become “high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THC can also affect the sections of your brain that control memory, thinking, concentration and focus, and coordination. When this occurs, it can trigger unpleasant side effects like distorted thinking, delayed learning, lethargy, increased appetite, low inhibitions, hallucinations, distorted perception, clumsiness, and memory loss. These side effects are normally temporary; however, they can still lead to dangerous consequences, especially if you drive while under the influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is marijuana legal in the U.S.?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Yes and no. The state legalization process (for medical marijuana) first began during the seventies. But, unfortunately, even though the process started 40-plus years ago, there has been very little progress on this front, in many states. Why not? Because each state is tasked with developing and enforcing its own laws, rules, and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, marijuana possession (in small amounts) has been legalized in other parts of the world (i.e., Czech Republic, Canada, and Israel), yet only &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881&quot;&gt;29 states &lt;/a&gt;(Oregon, Montana,  Alaska, Ohio, New Mexico, Arkansas, California, Illinois, New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington, DC, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Vermont, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Arizona, Maine, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia) have moved to decriminalize the herb for medicinal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that medical marijuana has not been thoroughly tested due to government regulations and production limitations. However, research suggests that it may ease nausea and vomiting during chemo treatments, alleviate chronic pain, boost appetite in those with HIV/AIDS, and relieve muscle spasms. In November 2016, Nevada, Massachusetts, California, and Maine also passed measures to legalize recreational marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Common Sexual Dysfunctions and the Effects of Marijuana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are sexual dysfunctions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual dysfunctions, also known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/&quot;&gt;erectile dysfunction &lt;/a&gt;(ED), sexual disorders, premature ejaculation (PE), sexual malfunctions, and sexual arousal disorders, are issues that can occur during any stage of the sexual response cycle (i.e., anticipation, plateau, orgasm, and decline). This issue can prevent couples from experiencing sexual fulfillment during sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the different types of sexual dysfunctions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; They usually involve four categories: (1) desire disorders (a lack of sexual desire or a loss of interest in sex); (2) arousal disorders (an inability to become or stay aroused during sex or sexual activities; (3) orgasm disorders (unable to climax (orgasm) or a delay in climaxing); and (4) pain disorders (pain that occurs during sexual intercourse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should I use marijuana for my issue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding marijuana and sexual dysfunction, THC can negatively affect penile function, possibly leading to premature ejaculation. How? Well, there are receptors in a man’s penile tissue that when confronted with THC, increases the risk of erection and orgasm issues. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this happen?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Marijuana boosts dopamine levels in the body. Dopamine regulates moods and emotions. If you get accustomed to really high levels of dopamine, you may subsequently find that your natural level of this hormone may not be high enough to sexually stimulate you, thus, making it harder for you to maintain an erection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is it Even Safe?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it safe to use pot for sexual dysfunctions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, the answer is complicated. Study results have been both inadequate and variable. For instance, a recent La Trobe University study interviewed over 8000 Australian men and women, between 16–64 years old, to determine how marijuana usage could affect sexual function. Researchers focused on condom use, sexual partners, sexual dysfunctions, and sexual-transmitted diseases (STDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that men, who use marijuana daily, are four times more likely to have orgasm problems and three times more likely to experience premature ejaculation, than men who do not use it or don’t use it regularly. In addition, researchers also found that daily male marijuana users are at-risk for delayed orgasms. So, why do men use it if it has serious side effects? Well, the researchers of the La Trobe University study believe that some men with premature ejaculation use marijuana because they believe that the herb will help them “last longer” – the reality is, however, that for many men, it actually worsens their conditions, causing them to ejaculate even faster. The common practice methods used to fix premature ejaculation don’t involve the use of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6090909&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on sexual dysfunctions and marijuana found that marijuana usage is linked to lower testosterone levels, which is a contributor to erectile dysfunction. Like the previous study, the results also suggested that cannabis (marijuana) is associated with orgasm problems like premature ejaculation and an inability to achieve orgasm. Likewise, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(08)01499-1/abstract/localization-and-function-of-cannabinoid-receptors-in-the-corpus-cavernosum-basis-for-modulation-of-nitric-oxide-synthase-nerve-activity&quot;&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt; found that marijuana can affect sexual functions by disrupting the part of the nervous system that regulates erections, thereby, possibly leading to sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What are the Signs of Overuse?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the possible signs of overusing marijuana, it is important to answer the following questions. Have you gained or lost any weight, since using marijuana for sexual dysfunction? Do you need a higher amount of pot to get the same results, i.e., “last longer?” Are you spending exorbitant amounts of money on this herb hoping it will improve your sexual performance? Do you suffer from terrible &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/&quot;&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., cravings, insomnia, increased hunger, mood swings, irritability, depression, and/or anxiety) when you ease up on it or quit taking it all together? And lastly, is it creating a disturbance at work and/or issues in your relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most people believe that marijuana, in general, is harmless, but this is certainly not the case when it is being overused for sexual dysfunctions. Dr. Juan Paredes, a South Beach Clinic board-certified psychiatrist, specializing in male sexual dysfunctions, asserted that one of the major consequences of marijuana overuse, when treating sexual dysfunctions, is that it can lead to extremely weak orgasms, premature orgasms, or no orgasms at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary&lt;/strong&gt;, marijuana usage and allowances have started to relax in some states and countries. And, legal restrictions and people’s perceptions of the herb have also eased over the last ten years. Because there is an increased acceptance of marijuana usage for a variety of reasons (i.e., from recreational to medicinal), it is important to learn the possible consequences of regularly ingesting it. &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; Well, because more and more studies are finding that there is a relationship between marijuana and male sexual dysfunctions. And, although smoking, eating, or even drinking marijuana &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; relieve some symptoms for some men, for others, it could end up being a disaster waiting to happen—in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Firing patterns in the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model - Continued</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2017-11-24:/2017/11/24/firing-patterns-in-the-adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire-model-continued.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2017/11/24/firing-patterns-in-the-adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire-model-continued.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Julia will be continuing on from last week and present the paper by Naud et al (2008) 'Firing patterns in the AdEx IF model'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article the authors explore the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as a good tool to simulate large-scale spiking neuron networks.
They show that the AdEx model generates multiple firing patterns in response to the parameter values.
In order to describe the transition from one pattern to another, the phase diagrams are analysed in the article.
To further classify the firing patterns, the transient response to step current is studied.
The analytical solutions are given for continuous adaptation, initial bursting, regular bursting, tonic spiking and irregular spiking as a response to the constant current.
It is also concluded, that the network simulations of a large systems, such as thalamocortical, require the description of different neuron types.
Parameter sets for three neuron types are provided, but further work is needed to extend this to a larger number of neuron types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full article could be found here: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2798047/&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2798047/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to ride a BMX obviously helps you handle a racing bike. How about a motorbike? A unicycle? A helicopter? The question of how far learning generalises beyond the original context has continued to vex psychologists. The answer has real-life implications for education and health. For instance, it bears on whether, by undertaking activities like brain training or learning chess, we can expect to boost our overall memory or intelligence – what’s known as “far transfer”. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417712760&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool conclude that in fact the evidence for far-transfer is very weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32784&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of “far transfer” point to highly-cited studies suggesting it can happen, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443283&quot;&gt;a paper from 2008&lt;/a&gt; that claimed the kind of “working memory” exercise that’s found in many brain training programmes led to improvements in problem-solving abilities or what’s known as “fluid intelligence”. However, it can be risky to read too much into single studies, so Sala and Gobet conducted three meta-analyses (which combine the data from multiple previous studies), involving three activities that are strong candidates for far transfer: chess, music and working memory training. The research was all focused on children, because you would expect any far-reaching benefits to be greater in those whose cognitive ability is still very much in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that instruction in chess or music, or working memory training, all led to small-to-moderate gains in broader abilities, like memory, general intelligence, and academic attainment. On the face of it, this is evidence for far transfer. But Sala and Gobet picked apart the studies within the analyses to find something dispiriting: “the size of the effects was inversely related to the quality of the experimental design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting the analysis to the best-designed studies, they found little or no evidence of far-transfer. The only exception was a robust effect of working memory training on other memory tasks, which is arguably “near transfer” rather than far transfer. This tallies with &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/&quot;&gt;an in-depth evaluation of brain training published last year&lt;/a&gt; that concluded such training improves performance at the specific skills being practiced, but that claims about its broader benefits have little support once you discount the less stringently designed studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far transfer remains a weakly supported concept. Theoretically, the evidence lines up with the “common elements theory” of learning, proposed by Thorndike and Woodworth more than one hundred years ago: learning will have the most relevance for the domains precisely being practiced, some relevance for domains with lots in common, and little for those more removed. The practical implications for education are straightforward: if you want to acquire a skill, train that skill, or at least something closely related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417712760&quot;&gt;Does Far Transfer Exist? Negative Evidence From Chess, Music, and Working Memory Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although psychotherapy is effective for many people, it doesn’t help everyone. In fact, in some cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-1/when-therapy-causes-harm&quot;&gt;it can do more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;. And while clinical researchers publish many studies into the outcomes of different therapeutic approaches, such as CBT or psychoanalytic psychotherapy, we actually know relatively little about the specific therapist behaviours that clients find beneficial or unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22531/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, although it involves only a small sample, has broken new ground by asking clients to provide detailed feedback on a second-by-second basis of their experience of a recent therapy session, and to explain their perspective on what took place. Intriguingly, the very same therapist behaviours were sometimes identified as helpful and at other times as a hindrance, showing just what a challenge it is to be a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is important to recognise that all therapists are going to make mistakes,” write Joshua Swift at Idaho State University, and his colleagues. “Perhaps the success of the session does not depend on whether errors are made but on the frequency of mistakes and how quickly therapists are able to repair them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32773&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift and his colleagues recruited 16 individuals, most of them women, attending therapy sessions at a training centre for clinical psychologists. They were seeking help for various problems including depression, anxiety and a history of trauma or abuse. The clients each saw one of ten therapists at the clinic (eight were women), who between them either endorsed CBT, person-centred therapy or integrative therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked the clients to watch back a video recording of their most recent therapy session and equipped them with a dial-rating device, which they could rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise to indicate how helpful or hindering they found each stage of the session on a second-by-second basis (the researchers call this a “micro-process approach”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of up and down variability through a session, which the researchers said shows the limitation of client feedback approaches which involve them filling out questionnaires at the end of each session, and which therefore might miss this variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the dial ratings, the researchers identified the three most helpful and three most hindering therapy segments for each client and then asked them to explain what was happening in those moments, and then why they found each moment helpful or hindering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most helpful therapy moments involved specific treatment techniques, such as times the therapist gave the client a concrete strategy they could use in everyday life; instances when the therapist made connections for the client (such as identifying events that affected their depression symptoms); or helped them process their emotions. Other helpful moments involved fundamental therapist skills, such as listening and expressing empathy, offering support or praise, or when the therapist discussed the process of therapy, including what the client wants from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clients said they found these moments helpful because they learned a new skill, felt heard or understood, gained insight and/or were better able to process their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hindering therapist behaviours, these often seemed the same, superficially at least, as the helpful behaviours, including instances when the therapist listened, attempted to express empathy, or attempted to structure the session. The difference seemed to be in the execution or timing of these behaviours. The clients said they found these moments unhelpful when they were off-topic (for instance, their therapist listened to them “rambling” on about irrelevant details without intervening); when they felt like they were being judged; or they felt it was too soon for them to confront a particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other unhelpful moments involved the client perceiving that their therapist was giving a perspective that they considered unwelcome (in one case, for example, the therapist suggested it was not a good idea to make long-term decisions when drunk), or their therapist revealed their own perspective through their body language, such as stretching and seeming frazzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the same therapist behaviours can be seen as helpful or harmful in different contexts shows, the researchers said, “the delicate balance that therapists must obtain while conducting therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22531/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;Understanding the client’s perspective of helpful and hindering events in psychotherapy sessions: A micro-process approach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Seeing Through the Lens of STED Microscopy:  A Brilliant Nanoscopic World Revealed</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=10316</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/blog/seeing-through-the-lens-of-sted-microscopy-a-brilliant-nanoscopic-world-revealed/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Corey Moran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have particularly poor eyesight like me, you’ll be able to relate to the feeling of uncertainty that comes with removing a pair of glasses or contacts. Your once sharp and crystal clear surroundings take on a formless, fuzzy appearance. Each object in view, from the known to more familiar, is reduced to little more than a blob. As soon as those glasses go back on, however, everything comes into focus and the world makes sense again. Much in the same way, biological scientists use the technique of super-resolution microscopy to place a pair of prescription glasses on a conventional microscope. The result? Cellular structures, both familiar and unfamiliar, come into focus in a spectacular way. This microscopy yields an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cell with nanoscale precision. What was once deemed too small to visualize with conventional microscopy, is now attainable with the resolution that this cutting-edge technique provides. Here at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), I have had the exciting and unique opportunity to work with the Stimulated Emission Depletion microscope (STED) from Abberior Instruments, the first of its kind here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The addition of the STED microscope to our institute enables previous boundaries to be broken — driving innovative research and critically important discoveries in brain function,” explained Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, Scientific Director of MPFI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernized microscopy would astonish the likes of Janssen and Leeuwenhoek, the fathers of the compound light microscope invented in the early 1600s. One of the most commonly used imaging platforms in current biological research, the confocal laser scanning microscope, boasts high-powered lasers, detectors for multi-color imaging, ultrafast scan speeds, and even software automation. Despite the many advances and revamps to the humble light microscope, one inherent property has remained constant over the hundreds of years; a lateral resolution limit of about 200 nanometers (for reference, that’s about 1,000 times smaller than the average dust mite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of super-resolution microscopy was born out of the need to surpass the optical limits of traditional light microscopy. So, what is this optical limit exactly? The resolution of a microscope can be thought of as the closest distance two objects can be apart and still be identified as two distinctive points in a subsequent image. For instance, an image taken on a confocal microscope of two point sources of light that are closer together than the 200-nanometer resolution limit would appear as a single, blurred object instead of two discrete points. This limitation is due directly to the wave-like physics of light itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As innovative as this technique is, it also has very tangible applications in real-world research. A concrete example of this would be a publication by Wijetunge, Lasani S. et al. Defects in synaptic dysfunction are extremely common in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. With the greatly enhanced resolution of STED, Wijetunge and colleagues could better visualize the shape of these dysfunctional neuronal spines. Their results conflicted with previously published research using lower resolution microscopes and furthered the understanding of the Fragile X condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many super-resolution techniques such as SIM, STORM, PALM and STED have been designed specifically to circumvent this barrier. STED microscopy, the modality that I have been using the past several months, was developed by Dr. Stefan Hell, who later shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his founding contributions to the field of nanoscopy. STED utilizes two separate lasers to break through the resolution barrier. The first being the excitation, the laser that excites fluorescent dyes/proteins and produces the actual light for the image, and the second being the depletion, an auxiliary laser that “turns-off” excess fluorescence in a doughnut-shaped pattern. Yes, you absolutely read that correctly, I did, in fact, say “doughnut” and as the name would suggest, that’s where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the power of this confectionary-shaped laser is increased, more and more fluorescence is turned off at the periphery. What remains is an extremely focused and restricted excitation beam directed right through the empty center of the depletion (doughnut-shaped) laser. When the two laser beams are superimposed, the magic becomes instantly visible by eye, a new image is produced with remarkable clarity and sharpness, almost as if a microscope ophthalmologist was hard at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology is absolutely fascinating and has far-reaching implications for the future of the field of neurobiological research. This newly-acquired resolution will make possible novel discoveries on the tiniest of scales in both neuropathology and basic science alike, envisaging the development of new therapeutics that will have enormous and lasting impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Abberior Instruments America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abberior Instruments America (AIA), a Max Planck Society spin-off company, manufactures and sells the most advanced version of Nobel Prize-winning imaging technology created by Dr. Stefan Hell, founder of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy as a scientific field. MPFI is AIA’s U.S. headquarters and its unique, super-resolution imaging platform will extend the limits of what is technologically possible today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After a traumatic experience, why do some people develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), while others don’t? Work to date has found evidence that various factors play a role, including a lack of social support and low levels of the neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (due to its role in the body’s stress response). Into this mix come &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Citation/2017/10000/The_Microbiome_in_Posttraumatic_Stress_Disorder.14.aspx&quot;&gt;new findings&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;i&gt;Psychosomatic Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, that an individual’s complement of gut bacteria (their gut microbiome) may contribute to their vulnerability to trauma. The researchers are now investigating whether tweaking the gut microbiome could help to prevent or treat PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32617&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author on the paper, Sian Hemmings, is based at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, where about three quarters of the population experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and more than half experience multiple traumatic events. PTSD is a debilitating anxiety disorder, which can persist for years. While estimates of its prevalence in South Africa, as well as other countries, vary widely, in the US, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/PTSD-overview/epidemiological-facts-ptsd.asp&quot;&gt;about 6.8 per cent of adults are diagnosed with PTSD at some point in their lives&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a pressing need for new insights into the factors that contribute to PTSD, and new strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clues to the involvement of the gut microbiome in PTSD come from its role in the body’s response to infection and physical injury (the inflammatory response), which can be affected by stress. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the normal regulation of inflammation, and lowered levels of Tregs have been found in people after they are exposed to stress in the psych lab, and in refugees with chronic PTSD, compared with controls. Since the human microbiome can influence levels of Tregs, the researchers wondered if there might be any differences in the gut microbiomes of people with and without PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed the gut bacteria (via their faecal samples) of 30 South Africans who had experienced a traumatic event. Eighteen of them had subsequently developed PTSD and they had lower levels of three phyla of bacteria – Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae and Verrucomicrobia – compared with those who hadn’t developed PTSD. Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia include many microbes that have been found to have immunoregulatory properties, such as mycobacteria, and &lt;i&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/i&gt;, and lower levels may be a sign of an exaggerated inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lowry at the University of Colorado, Boulder, a senior author on the new paper, told us he and his colleagues believe that low levels of these bacteria contribute to risk of developing PTSD, although the new findings don’t prove that link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future research is consistent with the gut microbiome influencing vulnerability to PTSD, the potential mechanisms for now are unclear. “We currently do not have a good understanding of why elevated inflammation, at the time of trauma, increases risk of PTSD,” Lowry said. “This may involve priming of microglia [a type of cell] in the brain, so that exposure to trauma induces an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this study, along with other work linking heightened inflammation to PTSD, does suggest that it’s worth exploring whether raising levels of these bacteria might reduce the risk of the disorder, or even help in treatment. Lowry and his colleagues are in the process of doing just that. In collaboration with US Veterans Affairs scientists, they are currently conducting a clinical trial evaluating the effects of a probiotic (which stimulates the growth of desirable bacteria) on the stress response in veterans with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A gut bacterial pathway metabolizes aromatic amino acids into nine circulating metabolites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24661</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/LirmVHPUbtA/nature24661</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human gut microbiota produces dozens of metabolites that accumulate in the bloodstream, where they can have systemic effects on the host. Although these small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating C. sporogenes, we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the molecular output of the gut bacterial community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24661&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24661&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/LirmVHPUbtA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Orthogonal muscle fibres have different instructive roles in planarian
            regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24660</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
             The ability to regenerate missing body parts exists throughout the animal kingdom.
                Positional information is crucial for regeneration, but how it is harboured and used
                by differentiated tissues is poorly understood. In planarians, positional
                information has been identified from study of phenotypes caused by RNA interference
                in which the wrong tissues are regenerated. For example, inhibition of the Wnt
                signalling pathway leads to regeneration of heads in place of tails. Characterization of these phenotypes has led to the
                identification of position control genes (PCGs)—genes that are expressed in
                a constitutive and regional manner and are associated with patterning. Most PCGs are
                expressed within planarian muscle; however, how muscle is specified
                and how different muscle subsets affect regeneration is unknown. Here we show that
                different muscle fibres have distinct regulatory roles during regeneration in the
                planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. myoD is required for formation of a
                specific muscle cell subset: the longitudinal fibres, oriented along the
                anterior–posterior axis. Loss of longitudinal fibres led to complete
                regeneration failure because of defects in regeneration initiation. A different
                transcription factor-encoding gene, nkx1-1, is required for the formation of
                circular fibres, oriented along the medial–lateral axis. Loss of circular
                fibres led to a bifurcated anterior–posterior axis with fused heads forming
                in single anterior blastemas. Whereas muscle is often viewed as a strictly
                contractile tissue, these findings reveal that different muscle types have distinct
                and specific regulatory roles in wound signalling and patterning to enable
                regeneration.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Structural basis for the initiation of eukaryotic transcription-coupled DNA repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24658</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/pc_eyVbaBcI/nature24658</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotic transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is an important and well-conserved sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that preferentially removes DNA lesions from the template strand that block translocation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB, also known as ERCC6) protein in humans (or its yeast orthologues, Rad26 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhp26 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is among the first proteins to be recruited to the lesion-arrested Pol II during the initiation of eukaryotic TCR. Mutations in CSB are associated with the autosomal-recessive neurological disorder Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by progeriod features, growth failure and photosensitivity. The molecular mechanism of eukaryotic TCR initiation remains unclear, with several long-standing unanswered questions. How cells distinguish DNA lesion-arrested Pol II from other forms of arrested Pol II, the role of CSB in TCR initiation, and how CSB interacts with the arrested Pol II complex are all unknown. The lack of structures of CSB or the Pol II–CSB complex has hindered our ability to address these questions. Here we report the structure of the S. cerevisiae Pol II–Rad26 complex solved by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that Rad26 binds to the DNA upstream of Pol II, where it markedly alters its path. Our structural and functional data suggest that the conserved Swi2/Snf2-family core ATPase domain promotes the forward movement of Pol II, and elucidate key roles for Rad26 in both TCR and transcription elongation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24658&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24658&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/pc_eyVbaBcI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: NFS1 undergoes positive selection in lung tumours and protects cells from ferroptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24637</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8igmNg9zONg/nature24637</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Environmental nutrient levels impact cancer cell metabolism, resulting in context-dependent gene essentiality. Here, using loss-of-function screening based on RNA interference, we show that environmental oxygen levels are a major driver of differential essentiality between in vitro model systems and in vivo tumours. Above the 3–8% oxygen concentration typical of most tissues, we find that cancer cells depend on high levels of the iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1. Mammary or subcutaneous tumours grow despite suppression of NFS1, whereas metastatic or primary lung tumours do not. Consistent with a role in surviving the high oxygen environment of incipient lung tumours, NFS1 lies in a region of genomic amplification present in lung adenocarcinoma and is most highly expressed in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. NFS1 activity is particularly important for maintaining the iron–sulfur co-factors present in multiple cell-essential proteins upon exposure to oxygen compared to other forms of oxidative damage. Furthermore, insufficient iron–sulfur cluster maintenance robustly activates the iron-starvation response and, in combination with inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis, triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. Suppression of NFS1 cooperates with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumour growth. Therefore, lung adenocarcinomas select for expression of a pathway that confers resistance to high oxygen tension and protects cells from undergoing ferroptosis in response to oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24637&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24637&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/8igmNg9zONg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A lysosomal switch triggers proteostasis renewal in the immortal C. elegans germ lineage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24620</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/nfW1gVtS_d0/nature24620</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although individuals age and die with time, an animal species can continue indefinitely, because of its immortal germ-cell lineage. How the germline avoids transmitting damage from one generation to the next remains a fundamental question in biology. Here we identify a lysosomal switch that enhances germline proteostasis before fertilization. We find that Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes whose maturation is arrested by the absence of sperm exhibit hallmarks of proteostasis collapse, including protein aggregation. Remarkably, sperm-secreted hormones re-establish oocyte proteostasis once fertilization becomes imminent. Key to this restoration is activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump that acidifies lysosomes. Sperm stimulate V-ATPase activity in oocytes by signalling the degradation of GLD-1, a translational repressor that blocks V-ATPase synthesis. Activated lysosomes, in turn, promote a metabolic shift that mobilizes protein aggregates for degradation, and reset proteostasis by enveloping and clearing the aggregates. Lysosome acidification also occurs during Xenopus oocyte maturation; thus, a lysosomal switch that enhances oocyte proteostasis in anticipation of fertilization may be conserved in other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24620&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature24620&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/nfW1gVtS_d0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Mechanism of tandem duplication formation in BRCA1-mutant cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24477</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/GIuB_-1Xsvg/nature24477</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Small, approximately 10-kilobase microhomology-mediated tandem duplications are abundant in the genomes of BRCA1-linked but not BRCA2-linked breast cancer. Here we define the mechanism underlying this rearrangement signature. We show that, in primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus–Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with ~10 kilobase tandem duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/Trollback__Company_office-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us spend the majority of our work day seated at desk jobs, despite the common knowledge that long periods of inactivity can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-296&quot;&gt;detrimental to our health&lt;/a&gt;.  While some inventions to improve health have been introduced into workplaces, such as sit-stand desks, they fail to take into account worker preferences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-2829-9&quot;&gt;New research published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigates the activity preferences of employees in order to better understand how to integrate various measures into the workplace, which may improve the overall health of the office-based workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nationwide study took place in Germany in the form of an office worker survey, where 2830 adults over the age of 18 took part in the questionnaire with a 53% male and 47% female split. The results give an indication of what workers want; to sit less and stand, walk and undertake physical activity more during their working day. The longer the work day, the less time survey participants wanted to spend sitting and the greater their desire to stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inactive lifestyle can increase the risk of developing heart disease and certain types of cancer and diabetes.  Inactivity can also decrease &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612610319?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;overall life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;. A recent study found that the ideal amount of time spent standing and undertaking physical activity for our health in a standard 8 hour work day is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/04/23/bjsports-2015-094618&quot;&gt;progression from 2 to 4 hours&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the study mirrors the results of the &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt; study wherein researchers found there was a preference by workers to sit for no more than 4 hours in an 8 hour work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the desire to remain seated for only half of the working day, workers reported spending on average 70% of their day seated. Changing this behavior requires various interventions and changes to the workplace. Sit-stand desks and other measures to increase standing have often been introduced without taking workers preferences for standing, walking or other physical activity into account, which may give an indication as to why there has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040784&quot;&gt;limited success&lt;/a&gt; in the overall reduction of sitting time in the workplace. This study indicates that physical activity and walking is preferred to simply standing and on average found that workers would rather spend 46 minutes more each day walking, and 26 minutes more standing in a standard 8 hour work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9632 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;277&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/Untitled1-300x277.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To integrate potential interventions requires a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000084&quot;&gt;change in behavior&lt;/a&gt;, a change in the social norms for office workers, a positive attitude as well as personal regulation and control. With the right motivations, such as taking worker preferences into account, a reduction in the amount of time spent sitting at work could be achieved through introducing complimentary countermeasures which may encourage compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions should therefore exist with the intention of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232166545_Fit_or_sit_Is_there_a_psychology_of_sedentary_behaviour&quot;&gt;habit-breaking&lt;/a&gt;. Methods suggested by the researchers include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21767727&quot;&gt;environmental modifications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769894&quot;&gt;active design building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307623046_Theoretical_Antecedents_of_Standing_at_Work_An_Experience_Sampling_Approach_Using_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior&quot;&gt;behavior change strategies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1057&quot;&gt;supportive workplace policies&lt;/a&gt; for more physical activity and the continued introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27256708&quot;&gt;sit-stand desks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The publisher Frontiers has retracted four papers in three of its journals after discovering they had been accepted with fake peer reviews. The problem of fake reviews has been on the research community’s radar since at least 2014, and several major publishers—including Springer, SAGE and BioMed Central—have retracted hundreds of papers accepted via fake peer […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating in our second language can have some intriguing psychological effects. We swear more freely and linger longer on embarrassing topics than normal. We’re also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/03/18/how-thinking-in-a-foreign-language-makes-you-more-rational-in-some-ways-but-not-others/&quot;&gt;less susceptible to cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;. According to psychologist Constantinos Hadjichristidis at the University of Trento, this is because a second language discourages us from relying on intuitive thinking. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2017.1371780?src=recsys&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, &lt;/i&gt;Hadjichristidis and his colleagues have shown another way that this manifests – when thinking in a foreign language, we’re less prone to superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32761&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, 400 native German speakers with proficiency in English imagined themselves in various scenarios, described either in German or English text, about an important day, like the morning before an exam or the day of a job application deadline. Each scenario involved a break in the routine, which was either mundane (like discovering the kitchen sink being blocked or spotting an airplane in the sky), or had a superstitious connotation – negative, like a mirror breaking, or positive, such as spotting a falling star in the sky. Participants rated how positive or negative they would feel in these situations, responding in the same language as the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading and responding in English, rather than German, made no difference to participants’ ratings of how they’d feel following a mundane event, but led to them describing less intense emotional reactions to the events with a superstitious connotation: they said they’d feel less negative about the bad luck events and less positive about the good luck events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening here? Intuition depends on easily accessible connections, such as the term “broken mirror” being repeatedly associated with dismay or discomfort. These connections tend to be built in earlier life, and invariably in our native tongue (the German participants in this research had only begun learning English from age 12, on average). When we encounter a concept loaded with superstitious symbolism in our second tongue, we know what it means literally, but the emotional associations don’t come along automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, our thinking is always influenced by our intuitions, which means even those who want to live as hard-nosed materialists may find magical thinking creeping in through the side gate. One way to combat this is to monitor the ideas that form and try to expel the unwanted influences. But this research suggests another approach: bar the gate so the influences don’t enter in the first place. For now, this option is only available to bilinguals, but it opens a route for discovering other modes of thinking that are more intuition-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2017.1371780?src=recsys&quot;&gt;Breaking Magic: Foreign Language Suppresses Superstition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/8719763907_fe86c038f9_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how many people really use foodbanks? The emergence of foodbanks – charitable organizations that provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/emergency-food/food-parcel/&quot;&gt;emergency food&lt;/a&gt; for those in need – represents a shocking manifestation of severe poverty and food insecurity in contemporary Britain. In the absence of more direct information, foodbank use is commonly taken to represent extreme levels of uncertainty in obtaining sufficient, suitable food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people visit foodbanks more than once, they are also counted more than once, so the true prevalence of foodbank use in Britain is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite highly publicized &lt;a href=&quot;http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSI-28-Food-insecurity-revised.pdf&quot;&gt;growth&lt;/a&gt;, the scale of foodbank use has been subject to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm&quot;&gt;heated debate&lt;/a&gt;. Food insecurity is associated with poor &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/4/324&quot;&gt;mental&lt;/a&gt; and physical health, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trusselltrust.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/06/OU_Report_final_01_08_online.pdf&quot;&gt;disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, so the recent growth in foodbank use could warn of an escalating nutrition and public health crisis in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aimed to address a key evidence gap in estimating the scale of foodbank use. The Trussell Trust – Britain’s largest foodbank network – collects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/&quot;&gt;headline data &lt;/a&gt;on the number of food parcels given to adults and children. However, when people visit foodbanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://wandsworth.foodbank.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2016/05/WANDSWORTH-FOOD-POVERTY-REPORT-2016.pdf&quot;&gt;more than once&lt;/a&gt;, they are also counted more than once, so the true prevalence of foodbank use in Britain is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, each household’s annual number of visits was estimated by cross-referencing the names and addresses of people receiving emergency food from West Cheshire Foodbank. This approach made it possible to identify the unique number of households receiving assistance. This work therefore presents the first attempt to estimate the scale of UK foodbank use among adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that an estimated one per cent of the population of West Cheshire received emergency food between 2013 and 2015. Worryingly, this figure was higher among children. If scaled up, this would equate to approximately 850,000 people in Britain – nearly the population of Liverpool – who rely on emergency food to feed themselves and their families. This proportion rose slightly over time, consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/&quot;&gt;national trends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9634&quot; style=&quot;width: 837px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9634&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/fig-1.png&quot; width=&quot;827&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Number of unique and total recipients of emergency food in West Cheshire, 2013-2015&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed analyses revealed that the growth in repeat visits outpaced the increase in total visits (see Figure 1), suggesting that foodbank use is becoming more entrenched among certain groups. Repeat visits were more common among working-age and one-person households, groups who have been particularly badly impacted by the recent recession and consequent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743516300846&quot;&gt;welfare reform&lt;/a&gt;. This finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/working-papers/the-impact-of-benefit-sanctioning-on-food-insecurity-a-dynamic-cross-area-study-of-food-bank-usage-in-the-uk.html&quot;&gt;replicates existing research&lt;/a&gt; on the topic and strengthens the evidence linking economic and social policies to foodbank use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scaled up, this would equate to approximately 850,000 people in Britain – nearly the population of Liverpool – who rely on emergency food to feed themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these results do have some limitations. First, they relate to a single foodbank, which cannot fully represent Britain’s diverse population. Nonetheless, these results are consistent with what is known &lt;a href=&quot;https://westcheshire.foodbank.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2016/07/stillhungry.pdf&quot;&gt;nationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a localized approach also enabled unique households to be identified, a time-consuming task. The next step to a more complete impression of UK foodbank use would require the same strategy to be repeated among a carefully selected sample of foodbanks – a daunting undertaking that may not be practically possible. This approach would still under-estimate the number of people using foodbanks as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk&quot;&gt;independent foodbanks&lt;/a&gt; would not be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember that foodbanks are commonly considered a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/food-aid-research-report&quot;&gt;last resort&lt;/a&gt;’ and used by only a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gowellonline.com/assets/0000/3896/BP28_food_banks_web.pdf&quot;&gt;small minority&lt;/a&gt; of food insecure people, often because people feel &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038038515594092&quot;&gt;embarrassed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/jpsj/2016/00000024/00000003/art00005&quot;&gt;ashamed&lt;/a&gt;. Separate estimates that between &lt;a href=&quot;http://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FoodInsecurityBriefing-May-2016-FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/food-and-you-w4-combined-report.pdf&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; per cent of people in Britain experience food insecurity demonstrate that foodbank figures drastically underestimate the scale of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new work adds to growing evidence about foodbank use in the UK. Practitioners are increasingly well versed in the problem of food insecurity, and may have seen its effects first-hand: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/practice-news/one-in-six-gps-asked-to-refer-a-patient-to-a-food-bank-in-the-past-year/20005889.fullarticle&quot;&gt;one in six of GPs&lt;/a&gt; reported having been asked to refer patients to foodbanks in 2014. The health consequences of food insecurity are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592315/pdf/187e429.pdf&quot;&gt;costly to the public purse&lt;/a&gt;. Wide-reaching measures to reduce food insecurity are crucially needed and should especially target the particularly vulnerable groups identified here.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With nearly 50 million people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease worldwide, it is more important than ever that we find new treatments and hopefully a cure for this devastating illness. With that goal in mind, nearly 2,000 clinical trials related to Alzheimer’s disease have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov, yet there are only five FDA-approved drugs available to patients, and none can halt or reverse the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d67513;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we missing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Anytime You’re in Listening Mode: PLOScast Two-year Anniversary</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=7860</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/pyCCVM3N-5c/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/11/PLOScast_blog-hero-image_690x320-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;0000-0001-7318-5892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced world with its onslaught of environmental, societal and political challenges, science-related podcasts can provide an interesting, educational and even entertaining escape. Podcasts bring an interactive, personal approach and sense of intimacy to topics that might be dry when presented in written form. Plus, you can listen during your commute to the lab, library or office, while you’re exercising, cooking, or anytime you’re in headphone mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/ecology/2017/07/31/the-lab-bench-in-stereo-science-and-science-podcasts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;growth in science podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides evidence of their potential to deliver important stories to a broad audience. Podcasts are not just about stories, though. Ciencia Puerto Rico (CienciaPR) has increased the amount of culturally relevant scientific news content in Puerto Rico through essays, articles and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001740&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;articles distributed as podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the University of California considered podcasts as a mechanism to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enhance and accelerate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; research. Podcasts were integral to an early proposal for an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002632&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online bioinformatics curriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and are an appropriate component to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000787&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transform science communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through incorporation of rich media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PLOS, we’re celebrating the two-year anniversary of our own podcast, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOScast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. According to PLOScast founding host and PLOS staff researcher Elizabeth Seiver, PLOScast was established to give the organization a modern forum for thought leadership in the publishing space, but it quickly moved beyond this boundary. PLOScast engages listeners through interviews with innovators and thought leaders on the changing experiences of scientists in a digital world, the future of academia and its ongoing challenges, and scholarly publishing developments in an increasingly diverse landscape. These are serious issues, and PLOScast approaches them with integrity, diligence and humor. The show explores all things Open (access, peer review and science), including research tools; ideas for improving science communication; and exemplary, practical habits of successful scientists in all disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PLOScast enables us to discuss issues that are important to scientists, with some of the thought leaders in their fields. It also increases the visibility of the work that the greater scientific community contributes, every day.”—Elizabeth Seiver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When PLOScast launched at the end of 2015, development involved getting the logistics and day-to-day operations straightened out. None of the team members had experience with podcasting, so they needed to learn the basics, including what kind of equipment was needed, how to edit a sound file, and how to best promote each episode. Over time, the script itself has evolved to better engage the audience and optimize the listener experience. “I try to keep the listener in mind more now,” says Seiver. “I think at the beginning I was more focused on having the conversation itself, but now I try to have a running voice in the back of my mind thinking about the listener, asking ‘will other people understand this reference? Is this what other people want to know about this topic?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists and those interested in academics are certainly listening—PLOScast has over 16,000 plays in the past two years. With its reputation growing, plans are to diversify beyond the traditional one-on-one interview format and to expand its voice to provide early career researchers (ECRs) an opportunity to participate. The manager of PLOS’ ECR Community, Sara Kassabian, recently joined the PLOScast hosting team (yes, two people make a team), contributing an interview with preprint maven Jessica Polka for her inaugural episode. In “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2017/10/24/episode26/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How ECRs like Jessica Polka are reinventing science publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” Polka goes beyond the topic of preprints to discuss opportunities for ECRs in #scicomm and the role of twitter in creating positive change in #science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 10 most popular episodes by number of plays cover issues ranging from altmetrics and their history (episode 14) to big data in the social sciences (episode 23) and how to work with public information officers to increase the visibility of your science (episode 8). The top 10 (including number of plays as of October 31, 2017) in order are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, PLOScast launched with a broad ranging discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2015/10/19/introducing-ploscast-a-podcast-on-on-science-academia-and-the-future-of-scholarship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;c&lt;strong&gt;ollaboration and publications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/Cameron.Neylon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cameron Neylon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, formerly PLOS’ Advocacy Director. Part of this conversation covered bioRxiv, prior to that preprint server’s current phase of rapid growth. The second year began with an interview with James Fraser from UCSF on preprints and their ability to help &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/10/24/the-power-of-preprints-an-interview-with-james-fraser/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;authors stake a claim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on ideas, methods or results. The interview with Polka marks the beginning of year three for PLOScast; as with the rest of the scientific community, preprints are an increasingly central part of PLOS’ conversation on how to move science communication forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark this achievement milestone for PLOScast, we have a new icon that’s fun and quirky yet at its core remains PLOS. We leave listeners around the globe with the top five favorites of the PLOScast crew:&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Science-Exchange-Alector.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Science Exchange-Alector Partnership&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1191&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Science-Exchange-Alector-300x174.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #338dc8;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.–&lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51718545&amp;amp;newsitemid=20171120005339&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Science+Exchange&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=61a642df6eb9ddef7d99755cbc56ab23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading and most secure enterprise platform and aggregator for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), today announced a strategic partnership with Alector, a biotech company pioneering the discovery &amp;amp; development of immuno-neurology therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, to provide the company’s scientists access to a private R&amp;amp;D marketplace to accelerate their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Science Exchange platform solves the challenges of R&amp;amp;D outsourcing: we provide scientists with efficient access to a diverse network of qualified suppliers under a single relationship, and at the same time we provide sourcing departments with more information and control over their outsourcing spend,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “We are thrilled to be the provider of Alector’s R&amp;amp;D marketplace and help bring potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease to patients more quickly and efficiently. Especially following the exciting news on Alector’s partnership with AbbVie to advance therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, it’s clear that Alector has extremely promising drug targets — we’re honored to help accelerate these important discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Science Exchange-powered R&amp;amp;D marketplace enables scientists to instantly order more than 6,000 unique scientific services from the 2,500 CROs, academic labs, and government facilities that are available under a single Science Exchange contract. The partnership also will provide Alector with a platform to effectively manage the company’s outsourced R&amp;amp;D investments, including the ability to track supplier utilization, trends, and performance, which also supports the need for compliance with internal policies and external regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alector is the latest R&amp;amp;D company to choose to partner with Science Exchange, and joins more than 30 enterprise organizations, including 10 of the top 20 pharma companies, that use Science Exchange to more efficiently manage outsourced R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Science Exchange offers a unique platform for connecting with a broad network of qualified scientific service providers,” said Arnon Rosenthal, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Alector. “It is our hope that working with Science Exchange will enable us to more quickly advance discovery and development of novel immuno-neurology therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Science Exchange will support company-specific governance, approval workflows, and preferred vendors. To minimize the risk frequently associated with outsourcing to external service providers, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2Ftrust&amp;amp;esheet=51718545&amp;amp;newsitemid=20171120005339&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Science+Exchange+guarantee&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=c0ccaaac6a80714963a7c5d9c3db351d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Exchange guarantee&lt;/a&gt; ensures complete protection of data, assets and performance of agreed-upon services, all backed by a best-in-class, SOC 2-compliant information technology security infrastructure. Science Exchange’s ISO 9001-certified quality assurance system and dedicated regulatory compliance team also support regulated work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Re-Learning the Joy of Living with Journaling and Meditation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23126</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moving along the treadmill of life, many of us succumb to the ever-present pressures to be faster, stronger, more efficient, and smarter. Perspective on what is happening in our lives is lost. We focus on failure and lacking within ourselves, rather than the abundance and opportunities for growth that surround us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stop taking the time to appreciate the simple pleasures of our lives as we spiral our way into a depleted existence—physically, emotionally, and mentally. Now more than ever, there is a global need to circumvent this pattern of being. We need to learn to unconditionally love and appreciate ourselves just as we are, how we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Epidemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it was believed the cause of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/&quot;&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/02/mindfulness-for-children-may-prevent-anxiety-and-mental-illness/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/20/a-scientific-review-of-hbo-documentary-film-my-depression/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; was attributable to genetic disposition, personality traits, the existence of stressful events, physical health problems, and substance abuse, as well as serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine imbalances within the brain. Whilst this is largely still the case, this perception has altered over the last decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our fast-paced world, we judge ourselves as harshly as we judge others. We are encouraged and manipulated to compete with others with whom we continually compare ourselves. We try so hard to emulate or exceed expectations placed upon us that we forget our personal needs in the process (no time for that!). Stress and anxiety often manifest as a result as we try and prove our worth to the world, and depression looms when we judge ourselves as falling short of the benchmark that is set for us to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged periods of stress wreak havoc on the human mind and body. Chronic muscle tension leads to tension headaches and migraines. The cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine systems become over-taxed and the risk increases for the development of diseases like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/03/can-an-anti-asthma-drug-rejuvenate-the-brain/&quot;&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/19/link-between-diabetes-and-alzheimers-disease/&quot;&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/21/cartoon-nuts-reduce-heart-disease-and-death/&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; (just to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent times the media has reported stress, anxiety, and depression as reaching epidemic proportions, reportedly attributable to numerous causes including an increase in hours in front of computer screens, national and cultural competitiveness, the exposure to a broadening range of choices due to advances in technology, and the belief that worthiness is related to monetary success.  Additionally, there is a sense of “collective stress” in regards to issues such as climate change and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness &amp;amp; Self-Reflection &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst living a faster pace, society has forgotten the art of living in the present moment, and yet there is much evidence to support that engaging in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/&quot;&gt;mindfulness &lt;/a&gt;and self-reflection enables sufferers to break the cycle of anxiety, stress, and depression as it promotes a greater sense of well-being and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who engage in the art of mindfulness and self-reflection can improve their ability relate to the world around them in a more compassionate and empathetic manner.  A feeling of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/26/learning-how-to-practice-being-grateful-and-reap-the-benefits/&quot;&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt;, joy, and abundance is also often a pleasant side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Value of Meditation &amp;amp; Journaling &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/03/writing-away-your-worries/&quot;&gt;journaling &lt;/a&gt;can positively impact a person’s mental health as it allows one to “capture” a thought for long enough to acquire a 360-degree perspective on what that thought is about, where it came from, and how acting on that thought might impact those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many forms of meditation, like mindfulness meditation, work particularly well with journaling as it takes the mind out of a conscious, judgmental state and into a reflective, sub-conscious state. Such meditative practices smooth the path for writing down thoughts and feelings by prompting less judgment of the thoughts being written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditative practice can be merely taking five minutes to go for a walk in the park or to focus on breathing patterns—anything that promotes being in the present moment. Likewise, there are many effective journaling techniques that may help people with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/31/meditate-to-learn-compassion/&quot;&gt;self-reflection&lt;/a&gt; and mindfulness that work well with meditation, and they are not restricted just to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, mindfulness can be achieved through writing, art, photography – any means that allows a person to step into a reflective zone. It is for an individual to explore what takes them to that special place where they can set down their emotional and mental baggage to touch base with their soul, and nurturing a sense of gratitude and appreciation for all the simple attainable pleasures within day to day life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a friend sees you suffering and tells you “&lt;i&gt;I feel your pain&lt;/i&gt;”, it may be more than an expression of empathy. For about a quarter of people, it could be literally true. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759805&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Thomas Grice-Jackson at the University of Sussex, found that 27 per cent of participants experienced so-called “mirror pain” – watching someone falling off a bicycle or receiving an injection, for instance, caused them to experience physical pain of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00507/full&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, the same team of researchers has explored the neurological underpinnings of mirror pain. When some people have this experience, they don’t just show more activity in the so-called “pain matrix” (the network of brain regions linked to the experience of pain), they also show unusual patterns of neural activity that suggest they struggle to distinguish other people’s experience from their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32595&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied 44 participants, 18 men and 26 women, who had completed a survey that involved watching 16 movies depicting people experiencing injections and sports injuries, and reporting whether they experienced any pain themselves, and if so, what it was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one of the participants had said they didn’t experience any pain sensations; 13 others were “Sensory/Localiser responders” – they experienced a discrete pain in the same body locations as the injured people in the videos; and the rest were “Affective/General responders” – they described a more whole-body response. For the last group, watching someone getting hurt may trigger a general “nauseating” kind of pain, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used fMRI to scan all these participants’ brains while they looked at a series of 16 images depicting hands and feet suffering a variety of everyday painful incidents (like fingers being caught in a car door) as well as similar but pain-free images (like a hand closing a car door). After each image, they were asked to rate how much pain they’d experienced, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers expected the Sensory/Localiser types to show more activity in the somatosensory cortices (neural areas involved in processing touch) whereas the Affective/General volunteers would show more activity in affective, motivational brain regions, like the anterior insula. In fact, they didn’t find this. When witnessing pain, both types of mirror pain volunteers showed greater activity in all these regions than the non-responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, differences between the mirror-pain subgroups emerged in the way that different parts of their brains communicated with each other. When the Sensory/Localiser group witnessed painful incidents, there was greater communication between the anterior insula and the right temporal-parietal junction (rTPJ) regions of their brains, for example. There is evidence from other studies that the rTPJ is involved in representations of the self and “other”. “Our explanation of the Sensory/Localised group is that they systematically fail to attribute shared bodily representations to others,” the researchers wrote. There were hints of distinct patterns of neural communication for the other subgroup, but the researchers admitted: “The explanation for the Affective/General group is presently lacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights how there is great variety in our experience of seeing other people in pain. But it’s clear we are only just beginning to understand the brain basis of these different ways of empathising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00507/full&quot;&gt;Consciously Feeling the Pain of Others Reflects Atypical Functional Connectivity between the Pain Matrix and Frontal-Parietal Regions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: God in the Brain: the Science of Neurotheology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23114</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/19/god-in-the-brain-the-science-of-neurotheology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We are the only species on the planet known to practice religion. This feature is universal among humans: there is no nation on Earth that does not practice one or another form of spiritual belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is what makes our brain different so that we practice &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/11/does-spirituality-and-religion-guard-against-depression/&quot;&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;? Does religion serve any purpose to our species in terms of benefiting survival and progress? These questions are very philosophical. Many thinkers believe that religiosity is what distinguishes &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; from the rest of the animal kingdom and brought our species to dominate this planet. On the other hand, a large numbers of thinkers believe that religion impedes progress and keeps our society in a barbaric state. There is no doubt that religion played a very important role in early human history: providing the first explanations for the existence of the world around us. The need for such explanation highlights an important step in the development of the brain and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/15/brain-training-can-we-really-enhance-our-cognitive-skills/&quot;&gt;cognitive &lt;/a&gt;processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral traits might become strengthened by evolution if they bring survival benefits. Researchers think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/29/neurological-basis-of-altruism/&quot;&gt;altruism&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, is this kind of behavioral trait: it might be disadvantageous for a particular individual at a particular instance, but it brings advantages to the species in general. Altruistic behavior is promoted by the majority of the world’s religions. Therefore, religious practices might have provided evolutionary advantages for early humans in terms of survival too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are so deeply religious that the system of beliefs they practice shapes their whole life. It would be reasonable to assume that something interesting should be going on in their brain. It is also quite likely that these brain processes are different from the processes in the brains of unbelievers. This is what the new science of neurotheology is aiming to study. Neurotheology investigates the neural correlates of religious and spiritual beliefs. Such studies may help to uncover why some people are more inclined towards spirituality, while others remain deeply skeptical about the whole idea of God’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already some interesting findings from the field of neuroscience that can help to open the window into the spiritual brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is no single part of the brain which is “responsible” for an individual’s relationship with their God/s. Like any emotionally intense human experience, religious experiences involves multiple parts and systems of the brain. Several experiments with the use of brain scanners confirm this point of view. In one study, Carmelite nuns were asked to remember their most intense mystical experience while neuroimaging of their brain was conducted. The loci of activation in this experiment were observed in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, right middle temporal cortex, right inferior and superior parietal lobules, right caudate, left medial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, left insula, left caudate, and left brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an fMRI study on religious Mormon subjects found areas of activation in the nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. The nucleus accumbens is the brain area associated with reward. It is also involved in emotional responses to  love, sex, drugs, and music. One recent study also identified a number of changes in regional cortical volumes that are associated with several components of religiosity, such as an intimate relationship with God and fear of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears likely that life-changing religious experiences may be linked to changes in brain structure. For instance, one study demonstrated that the brains of older adults who reported such experiences feature a degree of hippocampal atrophy. Hippocampal atrophy is an important factor in the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/22/older-age-dementia-and-circadian-rhythms/&quot;&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. It remains unclear exactly how structural changes in the brain and the level of religiosity relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that some drugs simulate spiritual experiences. For instance, psilosybin, the active ingredient in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/22/magic-mushrooms-for-mental-health/&quot;&gt;magic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;”, stimulates temporal lobes and mimics religious experiences. This implies that spirituality is rooted in neuronal physiology. It is no wonder that psychoactive compounds are often used in ritualistic and shamanistic practices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All studies that involve brain imaging of people in specific states suffer from one major limitation: it is hard to be sure that people are actually in that particular state at the time of measurement. For instance, if we measure the brain activity when a subject is supposed to solve a mathematical task, we can’t be 100% sure that his or her mind is not wondering around instead of focusing on the task. The same applies to the measurement of any spiritual state. Therefore, the patterns of brain activation obtained through brain imaging should not be viewed as ultimate proof of any theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various religious practices have the potential to influence our health, in both positive and negative directions. It was noted that religious people, in general, have a lower risk of anxiety and depression. This, in turn, is linked to a stronger immune system. On the other hand, people engaged in religious struggles might experience the opposite effects. Research into the brain’s response to religious practices might help to develop further our understanding of the connection between health and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Medicinal Plants and the Brain — St. John’s Wort, Skullcap, and Ashwagandha</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23131</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/17/the-influence-of-medicinal-plants-on-the-brain-part-i/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Medicinal plants still comprise a nebulous cloud in biomedical science. We know they have been used since the dawn of man, but there are precious few good quality scientific studies that support their use. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, plant medicines consist of many different molecules that interact together in the body to have a variety of, poorly understood, pharmacological effects. Despite variably successful attempts to identify single molecules in plants for drug development, we should acknowledge that the whole is greater than a single part. There is an increasing number of clinical studies which strongly imply that root, leaf, and flower extracts of medicinal plants can influence the brain and are effective at treating cognitive disorders. This article series will examine plants where we have double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to support their medicinal influence on the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. John’s wort&lt;/strong&gt; is a commonly known plant that is native to Europe and yields bright yellow flowers. Its name comes from flowering around St. John’s day on the 24th June. St. John’s wort has been used as long ago as the ancient Greeks, and the physician Dioscorides (40–90AD) used it in the treatment of sciatica. However, St. John’s wort has become known as less of a treatment for nerve pain and more so for &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/12/sad-and-in-pain-the-link-between-migraine-and-depression/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled trials confirming its antidepressant properties. Authors typically compare St. John’s wort with mainstream anti-depressant drugs and find it has a preferable side effects profile. It is not without its downsides however, as excessive use has been linked to serotonin syndrome, sun sensitivity, and easy skin burning, and more generally with increased pharmaceutical drug metabolism by the liver. This means St. John’s wort may not be suitable for applications alongside other pharmaceutical drugs, and it is contraindicated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American skullcap&lt;/strong&gt; is a member of the mint family that is native to North America and grows wild in meadows and swamps. It was used by the Native Americans as a sedative and America’s 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century physicians, the Eclectics, widely used the herb for complaints involving an overactive nervous system such as insomnia, anxiety, and epilepsy. A human double-blind, placebo-controlled study supports skullcap’s application against &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and a mood elevating effect has also been noted. Herbalist’s view both St. John’s wort and American skullcap as ‘nervine tonics’, meaning that they act upon the nervous system medicinally and are also considered to have a long-term renewing effect. While, this claim is yet to be verified by scientific studies, it certainly warrants further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/strong&gt;, the root of which is a popular home remedy in India, is a plant native to India that is mentioned in the traditional Ayurvedic medical text, the &lt;em&gt;Charaka Samhita&lt;/em&gt;, approximately 2000 years ago. Here it is recommended as a tonic for emancipation, reproductive ability, and longevity. In Ayurveda, it is classified as a ‘rasayana herb’, a class of plant that are considered to restore and support long-term health and that overlaps to some degree with the Western definition of a ‘tonic herb’. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies support ashwagandha’s role in the reduction of anxiety. It’s wide-ranging medicinal properties are supported by two additional well-controlled, human clinical studies on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/13/pain-in-osteoarthritis/&quot;&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; and subclinical hypothyroidism. The emerging picture is that ashwagandha possesses a wide range of medicinal properties that will likely be better understood in the future. Ashwagandha has been well-tolerated across clinical trials, with a side effect profile similar to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the world we humans spend a great deal of time connected to the internet, this is especially true for younger people – who are growing up surrounded by this technology. You can see this huge change over time in graph from Our World in Data below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_593&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alex post pic1&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-593&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;593&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Alex post pic1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/alex-post-pic1.png?w=474?w=474&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/alex-post-pic1.png?w=474?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/alex-post-pic1.png?w=474&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;872,400&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/17/590/alex-post-pic1/&quot; src=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/alex-post-pic1.png?w=474&quot; /&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, researchers and companies are leveraging this remote access to behaviour to answer questions about how humans behave. Companies have been collecting ‘user data’ for years from online platforms, and using this inferred information about people to improve user experience, and in some cases sell more products to the correct people. The amount of data we are able to collect on behaviour is expanding exponentially, and at the same time so is the quality and modality of this data – as people connect different devices (like activity monitors, clocks, fridges). Wearable sensors are becoming particularly more frequent – often this data is stored using internet-based services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/chart/3370/wearable-device-forecast/&quot; title=&quot;Infographic: The Predicted Wearables Boom Is All About The Wrist | Statista&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Infographic: The Predicted Wearables Boom Is All About The Wrist | Statista&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_3370_Wearable_device_forecast_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/&quot;&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology and cognitive science is starting to catch up on this trend, as it offers the ability to carry out controlled experiments on a much larger scale. This offers the opportunity to characterise subtle differences, that would be lost in the noise of small samples tested in a lab environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for many the task of running an online experiment is daunting; there are so many choices, and dealing with building, hosting and data processing can be tricky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Browsers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good starting point, and often the most straightforward, is building experiments to work in a web browser. The primary advantage of this is that you can run experiments on the vast majority of computers, and even mobile devices, with no installation overhead. There are some limitations though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Internet Explorer - sigh&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.discourse.org/sitepoint/uploads/default/21195/0bc6a8ea7fc9f167.jpg&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With multiple different web browsers, operating systems, and devices, the possible combinations number in the 1000s. This can lead to unexpected bugs and errors in your experiment. A workaround is to restrict access to a few devices (see below for tips on how to do this in JavaScript) – but this is traded off with how many participants you would like to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browsers were not designed to run reaction time experiments in, or present stimulus with millisecond precision. Despite this, some research has shown equivalent precision for &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0678-9&quot;&gt;Reaction Time&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109812&quot;&gt;Stimulus Presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are very concerned still, you may utilise&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API&quot;&gt; WebGL&lt;/a&gt;, a web graphics engine, which allows you to gain analogous presentation times to native programs, and even use a computer’s graphics card. Although this will be limited by the operating system and hardware of the user!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that can help you with browser experiments. From fee-paying services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gorilla.sc/&quot;&gt;Gorilla&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with task building, hosting and data management for you, to fully open source projects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jspsych.org/&quot;&gt;jsPsych&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychopy.org/online/fromBuilder.html&quot;&gt;PsychoPy’s PsychoJS&lt;/a&gt; – which deal with building experiments and data, but not hosting (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/wellcome-trust-funding-psychopy-is-going-properly-online/2809&quot;&gt;there are plans to develop a hosting and data storage solution&lt;/a&gt;). All of these offer a graphical user-interface, which allows experiments to be built without any prior knowledge of programming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;unity&quot; class=&quot; alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://answers.unity.com/storage/temp/56640-screenshot-2015-10-21-15-35-36.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One intermediate tool – which we are currently using – is cross platform development environment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst originally intended for creating video-games, Unity can be repurposed for creating experimental apps. The large advantage is an easy capability to build to a vast variety of operating systems and platforms with minimal effort: a Unity project can be built for a web browser, iOS app, Android app, Windows, OSX, Linux…. and so on. You can also gain access to sensor information on devices (hear rate monitors, step counting, microphone, camera), to start to access the richness of information contained in these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of this tool for experimental research is huge, and apparently appears to be under-utilised – it has an easy to learn interface, and requires minimal programming knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this post is largely non-instructional, hopefully it has shed some light on the potential tools you can use to start running research online (without employing an expensive web or app developer), or hopefully just piqued your interest a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;
