Table from &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-07714-001&quot;&gt;Warne et al 2018&lt;/a&gt; [fallacies originally documented by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/11861-001&quot;&gt;Gottfredson 2009&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A researcher in human intelligence at Utah Valley University has analysed the 29 best-selling introductory psychology textbooks in the US – some written by among the most eminent psychologists alive – and concluded that they present a highly misleading view of the science of intelligence (see full list of books below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvu.edu/profpages/profiles/show/user_id/10984&quot;&gt;Russell T Warne&lt;/a&gt; and his co-authors found that three-quarters of the books contain inaccuracies; that the books give disproportionate coverage to unsupported theories, such as Gardner’s “multiple intelligencies”; and nearly 80 per cent contain logical fallacies in their discussions of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-07714-001&quot;&gt;Reporting their findings in an open-access article in &lt;em&gt;Archives of Scientific Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Warne and his colleagues say that altogether the widely used books contained “43 inaccurate statements, 129 questionably accurate statements and 51 logical fallacies” and therefore “members of the public [are] likely to learn some inaccurate information about intelligence in their psychology courses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33429&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of topic coverage, over 93 per cent of the books covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&quot;&gt;Gardner’s multiple intelligences&lt;/a&gt; and over 89 per cent covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence&quot;&gt;Sternberg’s triarchic theory of intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (both of which challenge the idea of there being a unitary “intelligence” per se), even though neither of these theories are mainstream or well-supported by evidence, according to Warne. In contrast, fewer than a quarter of the books covered the most strongly supported contemporary, hierarchical theories, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-stratum_theory&quot;&gt;Carroll’s three-statrum model&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattell–Horn–Carroll_theory&quot;&gt;CHC theory&lt;/a&gt; each of which posits the influence of a general intelligence on other cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify factual inaccuracies, Warne’s team used as a benchmark &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8&quot;&gt;a consensus statement on intelligence&lt;/a&gt; research published in 1997 by Linda Gottfredson et al, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77&quot;&gt;a 1996 APA report on the state of the field&lt;/a&gt;. Although no longer cutting edge, Warne chose these references because they reflect consensus in the field and because they are old enough for the information in them to have filtered through to non-specialist textbook authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common inaccuracy (appearing in nearly half the books) was that intelligence tests are biased against particular groups or individuals. This contradicts the 1997 consensus statement which tackles this issue and concludes that “intelligence tests are not culturally biased”.&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-07714-001&quot;&gt;Warne et al, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other common inaccuracies included promotion of the idea that it is not possible to measure intelligence in a meaningful way (in fact, Warne and his colleagues point out that “it is actually easier to measure intelligence than many other psychological constructs”), and claims that intelligence is only relevant in academic settings (in fact, intelligence correlates with many non-academic life outcomes, from life expectancy to risk of dying in a car accident, and is among the strongest predictors of career success).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the logical fallacies in the books is what’s known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genetic_Diversity:_Lewontin's_Fallacy&quot;&gt;Lewontin’s fallacy&lt;/a&gt;” – this idea, advanced in six of the books, states that because humans share about 99 per cent of the same genes, that genes cannot therefore have a role in the differences between individuals or groups. In fact, “slight differences in genotypes among organisms can result in major phenotype differences”, according to Warne and his team. Twelve other fallacies appeared in the books – see full list above – such as giving less scrutiny to politically correct ideas or claiming that intelligence doesn’t exist because it is a collection of abilities (suggesting the textbook authors had failed to understand the principle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; or “general intelligence”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of questionable accuracy (i.e. errors not covered by the consensus statements), Warne highlights issues around the discussion of the taboo topic of race and IQ; textbook authors overplaying the role of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/19/reverse-stereotype-threat-women-play-chess-better-than-expected-against-men/&quot;&gt;stereotype threat&lt;/a&gt;“, and authors having a tendency to overestimate environmental influences on intelligence (the books largely neglected the work of scholars who study the genetic influences on intelligence, such as the British researchers Ian Deary and Robert Plomin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warne and his team admit there is an element of subjectivity in their analysis of the textbooks. However, they tried to mitigate this by using the two consensus publications from the 1990s as a reference point, by being as lenient as possible in their judgments of the books, and by being explicit in the how they went about their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis helps explain why the public and lay journalists often express a scepticism toward intelligence and intelligence testing that is at odds with expert opinion (perhaps best captured by the hackneyed claim that “intelligence tests only measure your ability to take intelligence tests”). Over a million students take introductory psych courses every year in the USA alone (a majority of whom are taking the course as part of a different degree subject), and judging by the content of most popular introductory psych textbooks in America, it seems likely these students are getting a highly distorted view of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obvious issue for our domestic readers is that it’s not clear if the same inaccuracies and bias toward intelligence research also appear in British and European introductory textbooks. In fact this is a recurring shortcoming in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/category/textbooks/&quot;&gt;our coverage of investigations into psychology textbooks&lt;/a&gt; – there simply doesn’t seem to be the same scrutiny of psychology textbooks here as there is in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Improving the public’s understanding about intelligence starts in psychology’s own backyard with improving the content of undergraduate courses and textbooks,” Warne and his colleagues conclude. And for anyone who would like to know more about intelligence, they recommend &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligence-That-Matters-Stuart-Ritchie/dp/1444791877/&quot;&gt;Intelligence: All That Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Research Digest &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/31/was-that-new-science-paper-hyped-and-over-interpreted-because-we-liked-its-message/&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/12/its-now-possible-in-theory-to-predict-life-success-from-a-genetic-test-at-birth/&quot;&gt;contributor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/20/why-do-more-intelligent-people-live-longer/&quot;&gt;Stuart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/08/how-do-you-prove-that-reading-boosts-iq/&quot;&gt;Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligence-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/0192893211&quot;&gt;Intelligence: A Very Short Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ian Deary – these books are “not only accurate, but they also have a breezy writing style that makes them easily digestible”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Danielle Stodilka and the Matilda effect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9952</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/08/danielle-stodilka-matilda-effect/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/IMG_0490-e1519165910764-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the speakers at the United Nations for International Women and Girls in Science day was Danielle Stodilka, a materials and data scientist from Canada who is a senior fellow with the Canadian International Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle received a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Florida in the early 1990s, at a time where very few women were involved in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to statistics presented at the UN meeting, biology has perhaps the highest percentage of women representation among the STEM fields, with engineering containing the least, at around 11% and shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my country, the recruitment and retention of women in engineering was still overcoming the impact of the Montreal Massacre in 1989”, she says, “I enrolled in engineering in the early 90’s to pay respect to the young women who lost their lives, while at the same time knowing they could have mentored me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s most remarkable about Danielle’s story is how closely it aligns with so many stories reiterated by female speakers during the conference; while pursuing a master’s degree as one of the few, if not only, women in her field, Danielle’s scientific work was appropriated by males in her research group without giving her credit. This behavior was overlooked at the institution, where all of the superiors were male and there was very much an “old boys club” atmosphere in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle references this to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/285482?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;the Matilda effect&lt;/a&gt;”, where the contributions of women in science are overlooked, citing an article that discusses the phenomenon in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some women have sued institutions for this unethical behavior, others have protested within the departments, all to varying degrees of success, but ultimately this behavior is still seen today. The fact that this is going on should be a high level of concern for all STEM institutions and industries, and should be on the radar for all funding institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Danielle’s story is not a negative one, but very much a positive one, as she met this situation with resilience and perseverance. She told another story that perhaps many of our readers can relate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was a small child in preschool, the boys and girls were given separate toys: the girls were given dolls, and the boys were given building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; style=&quot;width: 251px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Children_marbles.jpg/575px-Children_marbles.jpg&quot; width=&quot;241&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Photo by Tup Wanders Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tupwanders/83092660/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, she decided to leave the dolls for a little while and join the boys so that she could play with the blocks as well. At that point, a young boy told her she had no right to do so, since she was a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I in no way advocate violence,” she says with wry grin, but it did lead to a bit of a tussle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle went on to receive accolades for her work, and entered the field of Materials Science and Engineering in the early 1990s at a time when very few had been involved in the field. She went on to pursue a PhD in America on a post-graduate fellowship, when she found a female mentor in Florida in a field of her interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a science mentor is perhaps the greatest challenge facing women in STEM today, because there are so few women to begin with, it can be hard to find someone who can provide advice for navigating a particularly competitive and demanding field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle strongly encourages all women and girls to join the field of science, particularly that of engineering. She says this would be an excellent strategy to avoid the Matilda effect because she believes if more women are physically present and involved in decision making processes, science will become a more female-friendly workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went on to state that having more women involved in the STEM fields will benefit all of humanity, because they can offer new perspectives, not only for safety, efficiency, and aesthetics but also in new research discoveries and our understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Nowadays, there are many ways to access a paper — on the publisher’s website, on MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and other outlets. So when the publisher retracts a paper, do these outlets consistently mark it as such? And if they don’t, what’s the impact? Researchers Caitlin Bakker and Amy Riegelman at the University of Minnesota … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/07/want-to-tell-if-a-paper-has-been-retracted-good-luck/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Want to tell if a paper has been retracted?

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: First systematic study of people who can give themselves goose-bumps at will</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=33422</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/07/first-systematic-study-of-people-who-can-give-themselves-goose-bumps-at-will/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, goose-bumps are something that happens outside of our conscious control, either when we’re cold or afraid, or because we’ve been moved by music or poignant art. However, it seems there are a few individuals with a kind of psychophysiological super-power – they can give themselves goose-bumps at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a new study, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/preprints/26594/&quot;&gt;they’ve released as a pre-print at &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by James Heathers at Northeastern University, Boston, created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/voluntarygoosebumps&quot;&gt;a Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; with descriptions of “voluntary piloerection”, to use the technical term,  and invited anyone with this ability to complete a comprehensive questionnaire. Thirty-two voluntary goose-bumpers took part. Though the results are preliminary, this is a landmark study considering that voluntary piloerection has not previously been subject to systematic investigation, and that the scientific record contains just three prior case studies over a period of more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33422&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the individuals who answered the survey was 32 and there were many consistencies in their descriptions of their goose-bump ability, closely matching the few &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajplegacy.1902.7.4.369?journalCode=ajplegacy&quot;&gt;obscure accounts&lt;/a&gt; in the existing medical literature. Nearly three quarters said that the voluntary sensation or action began on the back of their head or neck; many described a shiver or tingle down the spine; and ninety per cent said the sensation manifested on their arms, among other body areas. The participants overwhelmingly described their ability as a voluntary act, akin to deciding to move, as opposed to using their imagination or memories to cause the goose-bumps. They saw it as a normal, harmless activity and many were surprised to learn that others cannot do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tighten a muscle behind my ears … and the goosebumps appear on my back and then travel to my arms”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think about goose-bumps, they start to appear, I shudder/shiver, and there they are”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I simple [sic] think of doing it. I don’t need to have a [sic] emotion involved, in fact I can do it now without feeling any emotion whatsoever”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I flex a ‘muscle’ in my brain. Sometimes I have to concentrate a little if I’ve been doing it a while”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the participants said that they noticed their ability in adolescence or early adulthood; two said they only realised they had the ability after reading the description on Facebook (leading the researchers to doubt that the ability arises via conditioning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the participants didn’t use emotions to produce their goose-bumps, triggering the sensation was associated with subsequent emotional experience, especially absorption and wonder (similar to involuntary goose-bumps). In fact, nearly three quarters of them said they deliberately triggered goose-bumps while engaged in aesthetic activities, such as listening to music or dancing, and also activities like sex and study, as if to accentuate or facilitate these experiences. Half of them also used their ability to prolong involuntary goose-bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obvious criticism of the study is that the participants’ accounts must be taken on trust – the researchers didn’t invite these individuals to the lab to study the phenomenon with their own eyes (or if they have, these results aren’t available yet). However, given the consistency of the accounts, Heathers and his colleagues doubt that the participants are fabricating, and they added: “It is unlikely any participant had prior cues or expectations regarding how their ability might be expected to work due its rarity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the survey, the participants also completed a personality and emotion questionnaire and the most striking result was that they scored much higher than average on the trait of Openness, and they experienced the state of absorption more often than normal. The personality finding isn’t surprising given that prior research has found that more open individuals are more prone to involuntary goose-bumps; openness is also associated with self-experimentation, which may be one way that the goose-bumpers discovered or developed their skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we still have no idea about the prevalence of the voluntary goose-bump ability because the researchers don’t know how many people viewed their online advertisements for the survey. We do know that they screened 682 first-year psychology students, and none of them had the ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be exciting to see what more can be discovered about this little known phenomenon, especially how other physiological systems such as heart rate are involved, and how it affects emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author James Heathers, perhaps best known for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research&quot;&gt;data sleuthing activities&lt;/a&gt;, said (on Twitter): “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamesheathers/status/969330864164392960&quot;&gt;This is the strangest thing I’ve ever gotten to study, and I love it&lt;/a&gt;“. Can he do it? “No,” he said, adding: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamesheathers/status/969336047682367488&quot;&gt;Do you know how many hours I’ve spent staring at my damn arms or hands, trying to focus ‘energy’ at the back of my head?? I feel ridiculous and I absolutely cannot do it&lt;/a&gt;.” Check Heathers’ twitter feed &lt;span class=&quot;username u-dir&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;ProfileCardMini-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav u-dir&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamesheathers&quot;&gt;@jamesheathers&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion and information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: The emerging field of psychobiotics (Part 3)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5317</guid>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/emerging-field-psychobiotics-part-3/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-5318 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-05-at-9.41.23-am-1024x652.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today in Part 3 of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/&quot;&gt;series on the gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;, Drs Amy Reichelt and Sarah McKay discuss mind-altering microbes and the emerging field of psychobiotics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome is a key node in the gut-brain axis. Scientists are only just uncovering how microbes in the gut influence physical, brain and even mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15133062&quot;&gt;pivotal study&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=&quot;https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v19i4/germ-free-mice&quot;&gt;“germ-free”&lt;/a&gt; mice that lacked a gut microbiome had exaggerated emotional responses to stressful events compared to normal mice. Intriguingly, more pronounced emotional reactions were &lt;em&gt;reversed&lt;/em&gt; when the gut microbiome was restored using probiotics. Findings such as this have lead to an explosion of interest in the use of probiotics for treating myriad illnesses including depression and anxiety in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the difference between probiotics and psychobiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2013/04/10/3733630.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Probiotics&lt;/a&gt; are living microrganisms such as bacteria or yeast, which when taken in large enough quantities, help improve and maintain the health of your gastrointestinal tract. The most frequently used &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt;biotic bacteria are from &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; families. Also included in the class of probiotics are &lt;em&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;biotics, which ‘feed’ or ‘fertilise’ resident beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102282/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychobiotics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a class of probiotics, which, when ingested, confer brain or mental health benefits through interactions with gut bacteria and the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychobiotic research examines rodent behaviour to measure changes in motivation, anxiety, and depression following treatment. For example, in 2015, a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; reported probiotic supplements &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408987&quot;&gt;improved resilience&lt;/a&gt; in rats following stressful experiences. Dosing stressed rats  with &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus helveticus&lt;/em&gt; lowered anxiety and depression-like behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gut feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have paved the way for studies testing the ability of probiotics versus placebo controls to improve mood in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17151594&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; double-blind randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; in 2007, 132 people consumed either a milk drink containing &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus casei Shirota&lt;/em&gt; or a milk-based placebo for three weeks. All volunteers completed mood and cognitive tests at baseline and every 10 days during the trial. When the baseline measures of those consumed the two types of drink were compared, no significant differences were found with any measure of mood or cognition. However, for a subset of volunteers who reported&lt;em&gt; low&lt;/em&gt; moods beginning the trial, the probiotic drink improved their mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have reported supplements containing a variety of probiotic strains, including &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus helveticus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20974015&quot;&gt;reduce self-reported negative moods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862297&quot;&gt;emotional reactions to sad experiences&lt;/a&gt;. Probiotic treatments also lower the body’s response to stressful situations which can be measured through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/cortisol/&quot;&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies suggest that probiotics have the potential to improve mood and help control responses to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can probiotics make you smarter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of their potential to alter brain function, research has examined whether psychobiotics improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probiotic supplements enhance the ability of mice to solve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23454729&quot;&gt;memory tasks&lt;/a&gt;. This improvement was linked to increased neuroplasticity-boosting brain chemicals such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus – a key brain area for forming memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress can increase forgetfulness, and stressed-out rats treated with probiotics were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408987&quot;&gt;better at remembering objects&lt;/a&gt; than stressed rats that received placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that junk food diets can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29251841&quot;&gt;detrimental to brain function&lt;/a&gt; and impair memory. A recent study showed that a probiotic cocktail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201738&quot;&gt;restored memory&lt;/a&gt; in rats that typically ate junk foods. Oddly, the probiotic treatment &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; memory performance in rats that usually ate a &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; diet. Such unexpected results show that manipulating the microbiome may not always be beneficial in a healthy population and have the potential to disrupt healthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the advocates (and advertisements) tout probiotics as the silver bullet for almost every illness you can think of, rightly so, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2016/01/21/probiotics-shaky-science/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plenty of scepticism&lt;/a&gt; in the neuroscientific and medical communities surrounding the use of psychobiotics as therapy for mood disorders. There is some concern that psychobiotics may be used a replacement for evidence-based treatments (including talking therapies), or as a reason to postpone seeking help from a mental health professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201775&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, immunologists Jotham Suez and Eran Elinav state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While some studies have suggested mechanistic insights into how probiotic bacteria may mediate beneficial effects, these were mostly done in cell culture and animal models. As such, insufficient evidence supports the efficacy of the current probiotics approach (one bacterial mix is beneficial to all conditions) in most indications, while their human health benefits remain controversial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suez and Elinav acknowledge out the huge potential for gut microbiome interventions as shown by faecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) for infections such as &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile,&lt;/i&gt; but caution against the “one strain fits all” therapeutic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US NIH National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…preliminary evidence that some probiotics are helpful in preventing diarrhoeaa caused by infections and antibiotics and in improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, but more needs to be learned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we still don’t know which probiotics are helpful and which are not. We also don’t know how much of the probiotic people would have to take, or who would most likely benefit from taking probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102282/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 2016 Trends in Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; review of psychobiotics concludes with the following rather long list of outstanding questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl:dr “Plenty we don’t yet know”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p52&quot;&gt;What are the dose-response functions associated with psychobiotics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p53&quot;&gt;What are the contributions of gut hormones in the mechanisms of action of prebiotics versus probiotics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p54&quot;&gt;How do prebiotics and probiotics differ in terms of their impact on microbiome structure and relative abundance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p55&quot;&gt;Are there undetected psychophysiological costs alongside the observed benefits of psychobiotics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p56&quot;&gt;Does the brain adapt to long-term psychobiotic ingestion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p57&quot;&gt;How do bacteria-derived blood metabolites affect the central nervous system, and how do psychobiotics modulate this relationship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p58&quot;&gt;What is the time-course for the emergence of various psychobiotic effects, and how long do they last?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p59&quot;&gt;Are there ceiling effects on psychobiotic benefits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p60&quot;&gt;What are the functional implications of altered excitation–inhibition balance (due to alterations in GABA and glutamate concentrations) in specific brain regions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p61&quot;&gt;Why do some strains of probiotic or prebiotic show effects while others do not, and are these linked to dosage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p62&quot;&gt;Do neurotransmitters produced by gut bacteria modulate synaptic transmission in the proximal neurons of the enteric nervous system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p63&quot;&gt;What is the direction of causality between systemic and central changes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;__p64&quot;&gt;How do factors such as diet, genotype, sex, and age moderate the effects of psychobiotics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Shocked, confused, disappointed — these are the reactions of authors who recently published in a cancer journal that was delisted by a company that indexes journals. Recently, Clarivate Analytics announced it would discontinue indexing Oncotarget after the first few issues of 2018 — as a result, the journal would not receive a current impact factor. The company … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;When a journal is delisted, authors pay a price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growth mindset – believing your capabilities can grow over time – can help us set self-improvement goals, consider mistakes as a step towards mastery, and remain upbeat when facing tribulation. Psychologists are excited by the ways we can help develop such mindsets, particularly towards creativity and intelligence, but some studies have found the impact &lt;a href=&quot;http://%2520https//osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tsdwy&quot;&gt;less impressive&lt;/a&gt; than earlier research had suggested. Now researchers are hungry to understand the individual characteristics that might prevent these interventions making an impact on some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12238/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has investigated one possible candidate – political ideology, specifically a perspective known as “social dominance orientation”. If you are invested in preserving the status quo, perhaps that encourages you to see social relations as inevitable, as “just the way things are” – an essentialist, fixed view of the world that seems to carry over to how you view human capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33415&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal Hoyt at the University of Richmond and her colleagues asked 300 online participants to rate their agreement with statements about social dominance like “some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups.” Participants then read either an article about intelligence that promoted a growth mindset, or an article arguing for the opposite (both articles used text and graphs to suggest that intelligence was either highly influenced or entirely uninfluenced by the circumstances of our lives, respectively). Finally participants rated their agreement with fixed mindset items like “you can learn new things, but you can’t really change your basic intelligence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants higher in social dominance orientation had a somewhat more fixed intelligence mindset. Their views also barely budged after reading either the growth or fixed-mindset article. In contrast, and against the researchers’ expectations, the low-dominance participants were particularly influenced by the article that argued for intelligence as a fixed quality (after reading it, they expressed a fixed mindset, as high as the high-dominance participants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps people who are low in social dominance beliefs are more open to scientific argument, and the fixed article was the one that presented them with a new take. In any case, the evidence suggests they are not the ones with most to gain from growth interventions, as was expected, but instead they are at greater risk of sliding towards a fixed argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, rather than suggesting that high-dominance people might be an especially hard nut for these mindset interventions to crack, the findings create a case for giving it a go – these people are no more resistant than anyone else, and may have further to go, and hence more to gain. All in all, this new research shows that individual differences are worth considering if we want to change mindset, but we’re still in early days of understanding how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12238/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;Social dominance orientation moderates the effectiveness of mindset messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: BMC Family Practice:  highlights of 2017</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/06/bmc-family-practice-highlights-2017/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/feat-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-017-0611-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussing success in support for patient self-management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the rising prevalence of long-term health conditions, self-management by patients is seen as crucial to making health care service more effective.  Support for self-management (SSM) by healthcare professionals is an important contributor to patient well-being.  Evaluations of SSM tend to focus on just one or two outcomes and so do not reveal a complete picture of the quality of service provided to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful self-management depends on many factors, many of which cannot be influenced by a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this lack from the provider perspective, Owens &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; conducted individual interviews and group discussions with health professionals who worked with patients with diabetes and/or Parkinson’s Disease.  Participants were asked to discuss what they viewed as successful SSM and what factors helped or hindered this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descriptions of success were complex and included elements that inter-related and sometimes contradicted each other.  The three main groups of elements of success were related to patient health and quality of life, patient self-management capacity, and provider-patient relationships and communication.  Many of these elements were specific to certain contexts or patients, highlighting the difficulty in developing generic measures of success in SSM.  One challenge that was highlighted was that successful self-management depends on many factors, many of which cannot be influenced by a health professional; meanwhile, outcomes which providers can influence may not be those most important to patients.  Additionally, the definition of “realistic” goals is both individual and subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions of success in SSM in this paper indicate the need for careful consideration of measures of success that take into account the complexity of judgment and many ways to measure quality in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-016-0578-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Self-Rating Scales an Effective Tool in Primary Care for Depressed Patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9999 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/checklist-300x200.jpg&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In Sweden, patients with depression are often treated in primary care. The recommended guidelines for this population suggest that general practitioners regularly administer self-rating scales as a means to monitor depressive symptoms. However, the most commonly used, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S), is specifically designed for a psychiatric setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent multicenter randomized controlled study conducted by Wikberg &lt;em&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt; sought to address the utility of self-rating scales. The trial assessed the use of pharmacological treatment such as sedatives and antidepressants, patient’s quality of life, psychological wellbeing, sick leave, frequency of care visits, and the severity of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three months, general practitioners across 22 primary health care centers either administered a self-rating scale monthly along with their usual course of care or proceeded to treat patients as usual.  This study found that participants in both groups had significant improvements in quality of life, depressive symptoms and psychological wellbeing between the start of the study and the three-month follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the study, there were also increases in the percentage of antidepressant use by the three-month mark. At the six-month follow-up, 69% of patients in the intervention group were still on anti-depressants, as compared to 59% of controls.  By the one-year mark, over 50% of patients were still using anti-depressants, with 59% in the intervention and 58% in the control groups.  Additionally, the control group visited psychology health professionals more often than the intervention group, while the intervention group visited primary care centers more than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikberg&lt;em&gt; et al.&lt;/em&gt; concluded that while the self-rating scale lead to increases in continued use of anti-depressants, the other variables measured in the study were not significantly impacted by the scales. Furthermore, it is their belief that self-rating scales ma&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;y be best left to the discretion of the general practitioner and the needs of their patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-017-0634-0&quot;&gt;How health care providers’ burnout and empathy affect patient outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure (BP) is increasingly prevalent in most populations.  Diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of high BP regularly take place in primary care settings.  Outcomes are often poor due to a number of factors associated with how primary health care providers manage and interact with patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that patients had significantly lower blood pressure when in the care of a doctor or nurse with low burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuguero &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated how primary care providers’ characteristics, specifically empathy and burnout, affected BP control and management in their patients.  Physician burnout is a measure of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization towards patients, and feelings of competence and success.  They found that patients had significantly lower BP when in the care of a doctor or nurse with low burnout.  They also found a significant association between low burnout and high empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown high empathy to improve immediate patient outcomes.  This suggests that the improved BP control seen in patients of health care professionals with lower burnout and higher empathy may result from a better physician-patient relationship and better adherence to treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study support recommendations to promote skills that improve empathy and reduce burnout among health care providers, particularly in primary care, to benefit both providers and patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-017-0642-0&quot;&gt;Management of Polypharmacy in Primary Care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9998 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/pills-300x251.png&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot; width=&quot;243&quot; /&gt;Polypharmacy refers to the use of multiple medications by an individual patient over their course of treatment. Increasing rates of multi-morbidity and chronic illness, the use of disease-specific evidence-based guidelines, and the lack of guidelines for multi-morbidity, have led to increases in polypharmacy.  This phenomenon is positively associated with disease management and quality of life, but is also associated with increased risk for drug interactions and side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that polypharmacy is most advantageous for patients, researchers have identified high-risk groups and provided suggestions for primary care physicians.  Researchers found those at highest risk were adults 65 and older, due to higher incidence of multi-morbidity with age, as well as patients in residential health care facilities. Outside of this group, primary care physicians have looked for patients at risk based on the number of medications they were taking.  While the number of medications prescribed to patients with risk of polypharmacy varies, it was recommended that patients taking ten or more medications should be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an insightful debate article, Molokhia and Majeed suggest that once physicians are aware of what factors are associated with polypharmacy, electronic medical records can be a useful tool to easily filter through patients.  They also suggested improving patient-physician communication regarding risk and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, regularly checking in with patients to ensure that treatment are followed as directed and frequently assessing whether each drug is still necessary can allow physicians to proactively manage polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/05/unveil-the-mist-of-pain-frontiers-in-pain-research/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/nerve-cell-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontiers in pain research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important direction of pain research is to classify neurons that are involved in the pain transduction pathway. With further functional identification and neural circuit tracing, the neural network of pain can be ultimately decoded. This strategy not only applies to pain research, but also to other fields in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breakthroughs are very likely to be made first on the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, due to their advantages of easy operation.” says Prof. Xu Zhang. The DRG neurons possess nearly ten thousand genes, regardless of the size or function of the neuron. Of them over 2000 genes are differentially expressed by 5 folds or more. Combining neural circuit tracing by viral tools, functional test by electrophysiology and behavioral test, the whole picture of DRG neurons can be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs are very likely to be made first on the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, due to their advantages of easy operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few years, the neuroscience community will ‘decompose the nervous system at a higher level’. The community is working together towards this goal, presenting us with a clearer view of the nervous system. Our current work is to set up a normal reference model at this level. Only by using this normal reference can we unravel abnormality in animal models or with transgenic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more about Dr. Zhang’s work on somatosensory neuron type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015149&quot;&gt;check out this paper.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Data-Driven Research in Studying Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The era of big data is coming, for sure,” says Dr. Zhang. As a pioneer of using big data strategy to study pain, his research benefited tremendously from the new strategy and technology. The gene profiling of DRG is like a dictionary, providing unprecedented depth of understanding and larger picture of pain study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From life science to pain research, multidisciplinary coordination is always needed to explore gene networks within a cell. Big data approaches like large-scale sequencing, computation and data statistics are becoming more and more essential, and will make basic research more objective and accurate. The Chinese government has been forethoughtful and gave strong financial support for the project of Mapping Brain Functional Connections, proposed by a small group of neuroscientists a few years ago and the achievements are now for all to see. This proves the power of big data in neuroscience and is a great start to a promising future of better understanding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the current practice of big-data driven research is still at its preliminary stage in China. Databases supported by advanced technology and professional management are in great need for further development of China’s big-data driven research. “Particularly, I hope China can play a role in international data resource network to facilitate data sharing worldwide, thus make scientific progress more efficient.” Dr. Zhang adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big data-driven research requires technical and policy support for data management. Springer Nature pioneered in supporting scientists to share data in smooth and in order. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about data policy and data support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Basic and Clinical Researches Are Combined in Pain Research? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Basic research has greatly advanced our understanding of pain. Patients with chronic pain require much more attention and more professional treatment,” Dr. Zhang points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long lasting pain may lead to alterations in brain structure which are not the direct outcome from diseases like periphery nerve injury, inflammation or cancer but rather subsequent effects of these diseases. Brain structure alterations would cause encephalopathy, resulting in a range of problems such as mania, depression, sleep disorders, learning and memory disorders and personality defects. From a clinical or medical perspective, it has been more and more accepted that “pain is a brain disease”, rather than “a local symptom” as it was previously recognized .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of pain treatment shall be influenced by the constant advancing of people’s knowledge. In light of that, an utmost important thing to do is to provide patients with better disease diagnosis and treatment, especially timely treatment of pain to avoid its progression into a chronic status. In China, joint efforts are being made by the government, hospitals and academic societies. Medical treatment combination, which is promoted by National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China and coordinated by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and joined by hundreds of hospitals, is the channel to benefit the public with the latest research outcomes and translational applications in the pain field. The goal is to build a comprehensive pain management and treatment system, so that the “pain clinics” can be as widespread as dental clinics, thus benefitting the pain patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xu Zhang, an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, from Institute of Neuroscience, CAS, is mainly interesting in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying pain and cognitive disorders. His lab used gene profiling strategy to identify pain modulators and underlying mechanisms, thus uncovered new regulators of pain transmission and new molecular pathways providing potential targets for clinic analgesia and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The human brain atlas: present and future</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/05/the-human-brain-atlas-present-and-future/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Brain-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of human brain atlas can be dated back to the early of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. At the initial stage, researchers made endless efforts to map the brain and anatomically partition it into areas based on cytoarchitectonic information. The recent human Brainnetome Atlas is a novel type of atlas that, unlike the ordinary ones, provides connectivity-based parcellation, with a specific focus on brain connectivity architecture. The unprecedented connectivity-based thought fills the gap in old-fashioned brain mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only by constantly improving the fineness and accuracy of brain atlas, can we make good use of it to identify biomarkers for mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the journey of Brainnetome Atlas is far from over. There are still much more to do before we can finally apply it for therapies like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). What is more, only by constantly improving the fineness and accuracy of brain atlas, can we make good use of it to identify biomarkers for mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – the technology that existed before the atlas – has been in a dilemma for a long time. Although having been available for more than three decades and still rapidly developing, MRI has not been adopted for clinical diagnosis criteria for brain disorders, particularly mental disorders. This could be due to limited disease data and poor accuracy of brain atlases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing the brain atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the atlas into use, we propose three important directions for future studies on the human Brainnetome Atlas. The first one is about identifying the biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy evaluation in different mental disorders based on more sophisticated atlases. The second direction is to confirm the matching of different areas in the atlas to functional circuits of cognition such as emotion and memory and to generate brain functional atlases at different scales. Another direction involves the use of the language- or cognition-related brain atlas in computational modeling in brain-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is tremendous amount of research that can be done on the link between brain atlas and the above-mentioned brain-inspired AI computing, which will be a research hotspot in the future. Although AI is a touted concept nowadays, challenges are everywhere including limited options of techniques for AI computation. Revealing how human brain processes information may largely facilitate the development of AI computation. For instance, it has been found that, when the human brain is processing information, the high-order interactions between neurons are characterized by the second-order interactions. It is important to uncover the false mask of the so-called high order. That will largely simplify AI computation and systemic structure design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next plan is to establish nonhuman primate brain atlases at three different levels. First, we will create a similar macroscopic atlas of macaque monkey brain as that of the human brain by parcellating its brain into different areas based on macrostructural features. Based on the macroscopic atlas, we will apply classical neural tract tracing technique and the new viral tracing methods to further create the connectivity atlas at the level of the neuronal populations (or different types of neurons). This is a major issue of importance to be addressed in the next 5 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the fineness, it is far superior to the purely MRI-dependent method. To delineate a microscopic atlas is our ultimate goal, although hardly achievable, as currently there is no better technique available in this field other than the electron microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The establishment of nonhuman primate brain atlas using invasive tracing techniques, which are inapplicable in human beings, would advance our understanding of the atlas of human brain. In addition, comparing nonhuman primate and human atlases at the macroscale may provide some hints on the similarity and difference between the two species during evolution at the brain functional connectivity level.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Understanding and preventing copycat suicides</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/05/understanding-and-preventing-copycat-suicides/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Suicide-Blog-pic-1-e1520245604790-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably first heard the word copycat in the playground. Its childlike nature belies the now sinister connotations of this word. Research into the phenomenon of copycat suicide is important if we are to understand and prevent it, but we remain far from grasping the chain of cognitive processes and other influences involved. This blog describes a study we recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1560-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and what it reveals about the influence of another’s suicide on someone’s own attitudes to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of suicide in the media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 the broadcast of the controversial Netflix series &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why &lt;/em&gt;generated a media storm, provoking debate over the extent to which young people might be influenced by the suicides of other people, fictionalized or otherwise. The graphic depiction of the teenage protagonist’s death, its portrayal as inevitable, and the apparent glamorization of the aftermath of her death were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iasp.info/pdf/2017_iasp_statement_13_reasons_why.pdf&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; by those concerned about the powerful messages conveyed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suicideresearch.info/news-1/commentonthenetflixseries13reasonswhy&quot;&gt;Suicide researchers pointed out&lt;/a&gt; the potential triggering effects of the irresponsible reporting or portrayal of suicide and self-harm, as advised against in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samaritans.org/media-centre/media-guidelines-reporting-suicide&quot;&gt;media guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These media guidelines are based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3315075/&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that young people may be susceptible to imitating the suicidal behavior of celebrities or others known to them where those deaths are glorified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These media guidelines are based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3315075/&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that young people may be susceptible to imitating the suicidal behavior of celebrities or others known to them where those deaths are glorified. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2646773?redirect=true&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/a&gt; of internet searches in the 19 days after the series aired revealed that use of the search term ‘suicide’ rose by almost 20%. A number of cases of suicide reported in the press subsequently bore similarities to the death portrayed on screen, and were highly suggestive of a direct imitative effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitudes to suicide after the suicide of a friend or relative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young people are also at increased risk of suicide attempt after the suicide or suicide attempt of a peer, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461080/&quot;&gt;evidenced by large-scale US studies&lt;/a&gt;. This copycat behavior is thought to be explained by social learning, and has also been termed imitative suicide, suicide contagion, or suicide diffusion. Whilst the majority of research on this topic has been conducted in the US, including attempts to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472458/&quot;&gt;the underlying cognitions&lt;/a&gt; associated with this behavior, until now relatively little work has been done in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently published a British study investigating attitudes to suicide after the suicide of a friend or relative, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1560-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This work provides valuable insights into whether or not a close contact’s suicide can trigger suicidal thoughts. To our knowledge, this is the published study with the largest sample size that explores qualitatively the attitudes of people bereaved by suicide towards suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the published study with the largest sample size that explores qualitatively the attitudes of people bereaved by suicide towards suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our online survey in 2010 we sampled young adults living across Britain who had lost a friend or relative to suicide. Using an anonymous internet-based survey we established the circumstances of the death and then asked: &lt;em&gt;“To what extent has their death made you fear that you may die in a similar way?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall we had free text responses from 429 people, and our team of researchers analyzed these responses using the approach of &lt;a href=&quot;http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/11735/2/thematic_analysis_revised...&quot;&gt;thematic analysis&lt;/a&gt;. We were concerned to see that a minority (26%) of respondents who had given detailed responses to this question felt that following their own experience of suicide loss they now thought of suicide as a more tangible option for them. Their responses conveyed that many now felt inured to any previous fear of suicide, to the extent that it had been normalized for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give one example, a young man whose brother had died by suicide some years before commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If anything, it made it easier for me to consider and attempt suicide. If he had not done it, I probably would have not considered it in my lowest moments&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly a young woman whose uncle had died by suicide reflected her relief that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Knowing that if things get to be too difficult there’s a way out.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides evidence to support the idea of a suicide suggestion effect in a sub-group of people exposed to a peer or relative’s suicide. This represents one possible explanation for the increased risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2609649?redirect=true&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/1/e009948&quot;&gt;suicide attempt&lt;/a&gt; after the suicide of a friend or relative. However, there is also a positive message from this work; namely, that the majority of those responding to the survey described great aversion to the idea of attempting suicide themselves, largely because of their awareness of the negative impact on other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is important for health professionals, bereavement counselors, and the general public in raising awareness of the increased risk of imitative suicide in a sub-set of people who lose a close contact to suicide. As a psychiatrist myself, I have resolved to ask my patients about their experiences of suicide in more careful detail, exploring their attitudes sensitively, and whether they might have been influenced by the suicidal behavior of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this study will prompt further research work in schools, colleges, psychiatric units and social networks, to understand how attitudes to suicide might differ before and after a peer’s suicide. Improving our understanding of the phenomenon of copycat suicide offers us opportunities to intervene and prevent further suicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite countless myth-busting articles online, dedicated bloggers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt;, and the publication of a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Myths-Brain-Psychology/dp/1118312716&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; described by Ben Goldacre as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/Index/Great_Myths_of_the_Brain.html&quot;&gt;a masterful catalogue of neurobollocks&lt;/a&gt;” (disclaimer: I wrote it), and another in the same series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Myths-Child-Development-Psychology/dp/1118521234&quot;&gt;addressing child development myths&lt;/a&gt;, public surveys continue to show stubborn, widespread belief in many brain myths and psychology myths, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/&quot;&gt;even among people with neuroscience training&lt;/a&gt;. Now the latest survey of the public via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=82576&quot;&gt;published open-access in &lt;em&gt;Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that little has changed. Belief in many brain and child developmental myths remains rife, even among those who’ve taken psychology courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33387&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prolific psychology researcher and author &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianfurnham.com&quot;&gt;Adrian Furnham&lt;/a&gt; sourced 56 brain myths from my 2014 book &lt;em&gt;Great Myths of the Brain&lt;/em&gt; and 49 child development myths from the 2015 book &lt;em&gt;Great Myths of Child Development&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell. Furnham presented the myths to 220 online participants (aged 19 to 66) and they rated them on a five-point scale from definitely false, probably false to probably true or definitely true, and also including “don’t know”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belief in the most infamous brain myths, such as the idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;we only use 10 per cent of our brains&lt;/a&gt; or that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;some people are left-brained, others right-brained&lt;/a&gt;“, remains rife, according to this survey (over 40 per cent and 36 per cent of participants said probably or definitely true, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were four brain myths that over 40 per cent of the participants thought were definitely true: that the brain is very well designed; that after head injury, people can forget who they are and not recognise others, but be normal in every other way; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141118-how-many-senses-do-you-have&quot;&gt;that we have five senses&lt;/a&gt;; and that our brain cells are joined together forming a huge net of nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there were two child development myths that more than 30 per cent of participants thought were definitely true: that all boys have one Y chromosome and all girls do not; and that a woman who is already pregnant can’t get pregnant again. Other strongly endorsed child development myths included the idea that sugar makes kids hyperactive and that dyslexia’s defining feature is letter reversal (65 per cent and 66 per cent believed probably or definitely true, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence that participants’ age, gender or educational background (including specific experience with psychology) made any difference to their endorsement in myths. However, those who rated their own common sense higher endorsed fewer myths, and there was a modest correlation between being more religious and/or more right-wing and endorsing fewer myths (Furnham has no explanation for these “surprising” correlations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furnham notes that participants were generally disinclined to answer “don’t know” – on average less than a fifth chose this option. “It could be that people were too embarrassed to admit they did not know when indeed the evidence shows quite clearly that they did not,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has a few issues, such as the lack of detailed information on the participants’ psychology background or their geographical location. There were no “brain facts” interspersed with the myths. Also, Furnham reproduced the wording of the myths verbatim from the books, even though many aren’t that easily understood without the accompany explanatory text from the books (some are also open to different interpretations without contextual explanation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Furnham says his findings reveal once more “the ‘shocking truth’ about the widespread acceptance of myths” and he warns that they are “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/10-ways-brain-myths-harming-us/&quot;&gt;potentially harmful and socially divisive&lt;/a&gt;“. He adds: “The question of how to combat these myths and ensure that people are better informed about various areas of psychology remains largely unanswered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329317303051&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Food Quality and Preference&lt;/i&gt; suggests that tea-drinking benefits divergent thinking, a key element of creativity that’s associated with generating ideas or identifying patterns. The researchers from Peking University greeted their initial 50 student participants with a cup of either hot water or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipton&quot;&gt;black Lipton tea&lt;/a&gt;, before asking them to use children’s building blocks to make the most attractive design they could. Independent raters, blind to the study purpose and condition, rated the tea-drinkers designs as more creative, in terms of factors like aesthetic appeal, innovativeness and grandness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, 40 more participants proposed names for a ramen noodle shop, and judges considered the names produced by tea-drinkers to be more innovative (but no more playful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea drinking has already been tied to enhanced convergent thinking – coming up with the single correct answer to a problem – but the researchers claim theirs is the first study to find a relationship with more open, explorative thinking. The reasons for the effect aren’t clear: no significant improvement in arousal or positive mood was observed in the tea drinkers, nor did the participants prepare tea themselves, a ritual that some have speculated could help shift mindset. It’s possible that the effect is simply due to relaxation – so why not sit back and enjoy a brew with your next brainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329317303051&quot;&gt;Drinking tea improves the performance of divergent creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Discovery magazine - Neuroskeptic: Scientific Salami Slicing: 33 Papers from 1 Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9387</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9387</link>
	<description>&quot;Salami slicing&quot; refers to the practice of breaking scientific studies down into small chunks and publishing each part as a seperate paper.



Given that scientists are judged in large part by the number of peer-reviewed papers they produce, it's easy to understand the temptation to engage in salami publication. It's officialy discouraged, but it's still very common to see researchers writing perhaps 3 or 4 papers based on a single project that could, realistically, have been one big paper.</description>

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen the recent viral &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54&quot;&gt;TV interview&lt;/a&gt; in which the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson claimed that an important part of the reason there are fewer women than men in leadership positions is to do with personality differences between the sexes. Specifically, he said that women on average score lower than men on traits, such as assertiveness, that are known to be associated with reaching senior roles, and higher on others that work against promotion, especially agreeableness and emotional sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these observations are largely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities&quot;&gt;backed by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-9010.87.4.765&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;, what’s far less clear – because the question simply hasn’t been studied much before – is whether women who reach senior management tend to share the traits of men in these positions, or if instead female bosses have a contrasting personality profile, indicative of an alternative, “feminine” route to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are pertinent questions for any one who would like more gender diversity in leadership roles because the findings could point to clues for how to ease the promotion path for women. For a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879118300228&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Vocational Behaviour,&lt;/em&gt; a team led by Bart Wille at the University of Antwerp has investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33385&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers accessed comprehensive personality tests taken by nearly 600 top-level executives (including 143 female bosses) and over 52,000 non-executives (including 17,643 women) from diverse industries in Belgium and other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men and women in non-leadership roles differed in their personality traits in ways consistent with the existing literature – for instance, women scored higher than men on characteristics associated with being more agreeable, such as being cooperative and people-oriented, while scoring lower on emotional stability and aspects of extraversion. In contrast, the personalities of male and female bosses were far more similar, with many sex-linked differences absent altogether or greatly attenuated (although the women still scored higher on aspects of agreeableness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…[M]en and women in executive positions demonstrate a similar pattern of classically masculine personality traits,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture was reinforced by the within-sex personality comparisons between bosses and non-bosses. Whereas the personality of female managers contrasted sharply with the traits of non-managerial women, male bosses were not so different in their traits from non-managerial men. “Women tend to be lower on traits that lead individuals to pursue and be selected for leadership roles,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this would appear to support the Peterson view: because there are more men with the traits associated with striving for and obtaining leadership than there are women, it could be argued this helps explain the paucity of women in management roles. In turn, helping women develop more stereotypically masculine traits of the kind displayed by the male and female managers in this study, could be one way to enable more women to become bosses. Again, this matches the Peterson perspective – in his Channel 4 interview, he talked about how he has coached women to be more assertive to help them gain promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one problem with this solution is that existing evidence suggests that women often face a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/04/female-bosses-judged-more-harshly-than-male-counterparts-for-being-insensitive-disrespectful/&quot;&gt;backlash&lt;/a&gt; when they display stereotypically masculine traits. Wille and his team mention this issue and they say that “organisations must strive to counter these biases”. Another criticism is that this approach is arguably all about changing women to excel in existing male-dominated hierarchies, rather than changing workplace cultures to make them fairer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, if there were a cultural change, then people with different personality profiles, including more stereotypically feminine traits, might more often reach leadership roles, which would then favour more women. Peterson acknowledged the potential benefits of such a shift in his Channel 4 interview: “It could be the case that if companies modified their behaviour and became more feminine then they would be more successful”, he said, although he added that “there is no evidence for it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you choose to interpret the new findings, they help answer a question that many have long speculated about. They suggest that even after several decades with an increasing female presence in the workplace, it remains the case that the same stereotypically masculine traits predict the attainment of senior roles among men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many issues remain unanswered and the study had various limitations. For instance, we don’t know if the women with a profile of higher extraversion and lower emotional instability were more likely to become bosses because they harboured more leadership ambitions, or because they had what it takes to overcome the barriers to the top. Also, the study relied on participants rating their own personalities, and it was conducted within a particular culture so the findings may not generalise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study found that male and female C-level executives represent similar populations with a common profile of characteristic agentic, strategic personality traits,” the researchers concluded. “Ongoing research and practice should acknowledge that gender similarity, not difference, characterises leader personality and potential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where they live, people interpret certain kinds of vocalisations, even from animals, as conveying a particular emotion – as “angry”, for instance, or “soothing”. It’s tempting to think that there might be similar cross-cultural universals in the ways that we use music – that a song used to calm an infant in Melanesia, say, should bear striking similarities to a song created for the same purpose by a culture in the Arctic Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s tempting if you’re a cognitive scientist – though not if you’re an ethnomusicologist (who studies music from different cultures), according to a survey of the opinions of academics reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(17)31675-5&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt;. “Historically, the idea that there might be universals in music from many cultures has been met with considerable scepticism, especially among music scholars,” note the authors of the study, led by Samuel Mehr at Harvard University, which then goes on to explore whether they do exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33375&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 750 online participants from 60 countries. They listened to a random sample of 36 excerpts of songs taken from the &lt;i&gt;Natural History of Song&lt;/i&gt; discography, which includes vocal music from 86 predominantly small-scale societies – such as love songs from the Fulani society of pastoralists from Western Africa, lullabies from Igluik Inuit hunger-gatherers from the Arctic Circle, and dance songs by a society of horticulturalists from Melanesia. “The broad range of cultures and languages…combined with the many countries of origin of the participants makes it likely that participants were both unfamiliar with the music they heard and unable to understand the lyrics,” the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These particular songs were chosen because each represented one of four specific social functions: “for dancing”, “to soothe a baby”, “to heal illness” and “to express love for another person”. The participants’ task was to indicate, on six-point scales, the degree to which they believed each song was used for each of those four reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listeners were fairly accurate at judging which songs were intended “for dancing” or “to soothe a baby”. They were less competent at recognising healing songs: while they were generally of the opinion that these songs were not “for dancing”, they found it hard to judge whether they were for healing or for soothing a baby. The participants were least accurate at spotting “love songs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second experiment, the researchers explored which features of the various songs the listeners might have been using to make their judgements. Using 500 participants from India and 500 from the US, they found that dance songs were rated as having higher melodic complexity, a faster tempo and a steadier beat, for example, relative to the three other song types. Lullabies, meanwhile, were rated as having lower melodic complexity, lower rhythmic complexity, a slower tempo and a less steady beat than the other three types. It seems likely then that these are culturally universal characteristics shared by music that serves these functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can’t be entirely sure this is the case. As the researchers note, all the participants in these experiments had access to the internet, so while in theory there was no reason to think that a listener from India would have been familiar with lullabies from the Arctic, they might have been. More likely, they may already have heard various songs with different uses from different cultures, and this experience, rather than cultural universals in the use of music, might have influenced the participants’ conclusions. “A stronger test of universality would require testing the inferences of people living in isolated societies with minimal access to the music of other cultures,” the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, overall, “these findings are consistent with the existence of universal form-function links in human song,” the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31675-5&quot;&gt;Form and Function in Human Song&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Research suggests link between suicidal ideation and low blood pressure</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/03/01/research-suggests-link-suicidal-ideation-low-blood-pressure/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/AdobeStock_139538849-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most studies on blood pressure (BP) have focused on high BP, whereas studies on low BP are rare. Unlike hypertension, constitutional low BP is not considered to be related to serious illness or death, and it is widely accepted that ‘the lower the BP, the better’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was not difficult to find people who complain, ‘I’m dizzy because my blood pressure is low’ or ‘I feel down because of my low blood pressure’. This raised our suspicions about the common perception that low blood pressure is not really a problem, and thus marked the beginning of our research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the 2010-2013 Korea National Health and Nutrition survey, we compared 10,708 people with either normal or low blood pressure. Suicidal ideation was identified by asking one of two questions: “Have you ever felt inclined to commit suicide over the last year?” (2010-2012) and “Have you ever considered suicide seriously over the last year?” (2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that among people with normal blood pressure, the proportion of those with suicidal ideation was 10.8%. This proportion increased for people with lower blood pressures: those with systolic blood pressure (SBP) &amp;lt;100 mmHg the proportion was 12.5%; those with SBP &amp;lt;95 mmHg, 13.7%; and those with SBP &amp;lt;90 mmHg, 16.6%. In other words the lower the blood pressure, the higher the percentage of people with suicidal thought. Observing the distribution of low blood pressure among those with suicidal thought and those without, we came to the following assumption: Low blood pressure may explain a higher risk of suicidal thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing the distribution of low blood pressure among those with suicidal thought and those without, we came to the following assumption: Low blood pressure may explain a higher risk of suicidal thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then analyzed the risk of suicidal ideation present in people with low blood pressure after controlling for potential confounding variables such as gender, age, BMI and underlying diseases. As a result, people with a systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mmHg were shown to have more than 25% higher odds of suicide ideation than those with normal blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that increasing the strictness of the criteria for low BP led to a more pronounced tendency towards suicidal ideation. That is, the odds of suicidal ideation for the low blood pressure group with a cut-off value of SBP&amp;lt; 95 mmHg and SBP &amp;lt;90 mmHg was 43% and 74% higher, respectively, than that of the normal pressure group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at low blood pressure, we also investigated the risk of suicidal thought at high blood pressure. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the risk of suicidal ideation among the higher blood pressure groups (pre-hypertensive and hypertensive) and that of the normotensive group. Therefore, low blood pressure may pose its own different health issues in comparison to high blood pressure. Our study hereby challenges the perception that, in terms of mental health, lower blood pressure is always better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this study is a cross-sectional study and cannot verify the causal relationship between low blood pressure and suicidal ideation. The study’s use of self-reported survey data may have introduced information and recall bias. As only levels of systolic blood pressure were used to define low blood pressure, future studies are needed to explore the relationship between suicidal ideation and diastolic blood pressure. Further research is also needed into the possible biological mechanisms that may explain the association between blood pressure and suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to investigate the association between low BP and suicidal ideation, which is an indicator of a negative psychiatric state, and thus underscores the need to re-evaluate the health implications of low BP. This may also call for careful monitoring of the mental health conditions of those with low BP.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: BMC International Health and Human Rights announces its revised scope</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9968</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/02/28/bmc-international-health-human-rights-announces-revised-scope/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/rights-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to health was first brought to light as a social right in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution-en.pdf?ua=1&quot;&gt;World Health Organization (WHO) Constitution (1946)&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)&lt;/a&gt; where the obligation of understanding health as a human right emerged to ensure that, not only should there be access to essential medicines and affordable health care, but there should also be the provision of basic determinants of health such as food, housing, sanitation, safe water and health-related education to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The States Parties to the WHO Constitution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the interest in human rights issues having grown exponentially in recent years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC International Health and Human Rights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides a niche home for work which is carried out to communicate, across various disciplines and geographical boundaries, human rights issues related to health. The journal also welcomes &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/debate&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; pieces, important for stimulating discussion and further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In highlighting &lt;em&gt;BMC International Health and Human Rights&lt;/em&gt; as a forum for activists, practitioners and academics from human rights, public health and related fields, we are delighted to announce the revised scope of the journal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC International Health and Human Rights&lt;/em&gt; is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that considers articles on the influences of human rights violations on health in developing and transitional countries, as well as all issues relating to the impact of health policies, programs and practices on human rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal is separated into the following sections, each with its own focus on core subject areas under the umbrella of health and human rights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/health-and-human-rights-of-marginalized-populations&quot;&gt;Health and human rights of marginalized populations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9972&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9972&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/aid-300x218.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantaged and marginalised populations tend to be excluded from what may be considered by them to be the luxury of enjoying good health. This section of the journal considers studies regarding the health and human rights of members of marginalized populations, including sexual and gender minorities, children, migrants, ethnic minorities, refugees, displaced people, commercial sex workers, injection drug users, and other marginalized populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/healthcare-availability-practices-and-development&quot;&gt;Healthcare availability, practices and development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare needs to be both available and accessible to all. Together with the need for a sufficient quantity of health care facilities, goods, services and programs, barriers of accessibility to these services should be identified and addressed. This section considers studies addressing all aspects of access to and availability of healthcare, healthcare knowledge, practices, and beliefs, as well as studies of healthcare development and training in rural and/or developing areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/prison-violence-and-conflict&quot;&gt;Prison, violence, and conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9970&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9970&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/prison-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harmful traditional practices, torture, trafficking, violence against women, and violence against children are just a few of the various forms of violence which have been recognized as human rights issues. Freedom from violence and conflict is a fundamental human right. This section considers studies regarding the health and human rights of prison inmates and victims of violence, war, and civil conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/healthcare-policy-and-law&quot;&gt;Healthcare policy and law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity. Standards in both law and policy are required to address barriers to healthcare. This section considers studies regarding the impact of international and national policies on healthcare for individuals and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/hiv-aids&quot;&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the world’s most fatal communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects the world’s poorest populations, and in many cases, its effects are intensified by other factors such as gender, age, sexual orientation or gender identity and migration status. This section of the journal considers studies regarding all aspects of healthcare provision for and the social aspects of HIV/AIDS in developing countries, including awareness, stigma, prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC International Health and Human Rights&lt;/em&gt; is recruiting Associate Editors for the above sections, to join its mission in promoting a global movement for health and human rights by publishing important and stimulating work in this field.

	<title>Forging Connections: Crushed by the ivory tower – a personal account of mental health in academia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/?p=607</guid>
	<link>https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/crushed-by-the-ivory-tower-a-personal-account-of-mental-health-in-academia/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The tone was set on my first day at university. After a tough year of sitting exams to get the grades required to be admitted to a competitive undergraduate science programme, I was sitting in my first lecture. The professor stood in front of around 300 excited undergraduate students and began their first lecture with the statement “A year from now around half of you will be gone”. Indeed, what followed were three gruelling years of constant pressure with exams every 6 weeks and term breaks filled with additional lab work, seminar presentations, or essays. By the end, only around a third obtained their degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than protesting this brutal pressure that robbed us of our intellectual and social breathing space, we students were largely complicit. On the contrary, a culture developed that aggravated and justified the pressure. After all, this level of sacrifice is to be expected if you want to make it at a top university. Plus, the recession had hit hard and obtaining jobs was seen as a struggle for life at an institution that offered little perspective on employment prospects outside of academia. It seemed like there was no chance to find employment without top grades and extracurricular activities to make you stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observed a similar culture as an MSc and later PhD student at a different institution in a different country. Senior academics told us that the commitment necessary to obtain their position had taken a substantial toll on their private lives. Again, there were myths floating around that made the pressure balloon to even more crushing proportions. Apparently, getting a position as a university lecturer is impossible with a Nature or Science publication, students working less than 45 hours per week might as well give up, and if you really took it seriously you should consider emulating Professor X who gets through his enormous workload with caffeine pills and nicotine gum. I adapted to this culture by working extremely long hours, working on weekends, taking on additional projects, and neglecting my social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After bearing the pressure stoically for a few years, I had my first breakdown during the second year of my PhD. I had fallen into a vicious cycle of caffeine-fuelled work during the week and heavy drinking on weekends – the abundance of cafes and pubs around university might indicate that this is a common pattern. One Monday morning, I did not find the strength to get up. The isolation and constant pressure of my PhD had sucked the joy out of my life. By sacrificing almost everything for my work, I had eroded all the support that might have provided some resilience.  Fortunately, I could get professional help and managed to start building a healthier relationship with academic work, which is still very much work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a learned a few lessons about triggers that make academic work problematic for people with a predisposition for depression and/or anxiety like myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unclear or unrealistic expectations: We often don’t know what leads to success and if it is attainable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolated work: In my experience, scientists often work by themselves and identify a lot with their work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high standards, abundant criticism: from anonymous peer review to seminar questions, scientists have to deal with a lot of negative feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparisons: the golden boy from lab X just received a fellowship right after his PhD, the people I follow on social media publish papers in high impact journals all the time, X is not only a great postdoc but also an accomplished concert pianist, …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a good solution for dealing with these triggers, but, unfortunately, I don’t. However, I think that there are things to all of us can do to change this culture of pressure and make life more enjoyable for all. First, we should acknowledge that longer working hours and higher workloads are not the route to success. In contrast, leisure time is essential for building creativity and resilience. Second, share your difficulties as well as your successes. Even the most accomplished scientists are not some sort of Übermensch and will have experienced some setbacks. It is important for junior scientists to hear these stories and learn how they can be overcome. Third, we should all monitor how we communicate with other people. You may disagree with another scientist’s work, but you should acknowledge that this scientist’s time, sweat, and blood went into this work. So, in reviews or Q&amp;amp;A sessions at least try to find something nice to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share your experiences and your suggestions in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2018-02-28:/2018/02/28/handling-variability-in-model-transformations-and-generators.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2018/02/28/handling-variability-in-model-transformations-and-generators.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will be based mainly on Voelter et al's paper on &quot;Handling
Variability in Model Transformations and Generators&quot;. Marco will provide
an introduction to the topic and explain how it relates to his
research. At the end of the talk he will provide a brief introduction
to Rose et al's paper on &quot;A Feature Model for Model-to-Text
Transformation Languages&quot; and explain how it interlinks with the first
paper and his research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main paper by Voelter et al: Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software product line engineering aims to reduce development
time, effort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the
commonality within a portfolio of similar products. The effectiveness
of a software product line approach directly depends on how well
feature variability within the portfolio is implemented and managed
throughout the development lifecycle, from early analysis through
maintenance and evolution. Using DSLs and AO to implement product
lines can yield significant advantages, since the variability can be
implemented on a higher level of abstraction, in less detailed models.
This paper illustrates how variability can be implemented in
model-to-model transformations and code generators using
aspect-oriented techniques. These techniques are important ingredients
for the aspectoriented model-driven product line engineering approach
presented in [13].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary paper by Rose et al: A Feature Model for Model-to-Text Transformation Languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model-to-text (M2T) transformation is an important model management
operation, as it is used to implement code and documentation
generation; model serialisation (enabling model interchange); and
model visualisation and exploration. Despite the creation of the MOF
Model-To-Text Transformation Language (MOFM2T) in 2008, many very
different M2T languages exist today. Because there is little
interoperability between M2T languages and rewriting an existing M2T
transformation in a new language is costly, developers face a
difficult choice when selecting a M2T language. In this paper, we use
domain analysis to identify a preliminary feature model for M2T
languages. We demonstrate the appropriateness of the feature model by
describing two different M2T languages, and discuss potential
applications for a tool-supported and model-driven approach to
describing the features of M2T languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;The Arms of Nildo and Rony:&quot; a NeuroMat story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;A professional motorcyclist and a surgeon meet up at the waiting room of a physiotherapy clinic. They share a common story: rehabilitation after a traumatic brachial plexus injury. Their fate is somehow similar to the one of a famous soccer player who, after a serious lesion, must attend therapy sections to learn again how to play, after a period of recovery. These stories are the guiding narratives of a newly released educational material for patients, caregivers and health professionals, the illustrated magazine &quot;The Arms of Nildo and Rony.&quot;
                        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although criminal investigation has been transformed through technological developments in DNA, phone tracking, and online data, the way a detective works through a crime has remained much the same. The first suspect is often the true perpetrator, but not always, and snowballing biases continue to lead to miscarriages of justice. Proficient detectives need the ability to generate and evaluate different explanations and keep an open mind. New &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-017-9231-3&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology&lt;/i&gt; investigates whether it’s possible to use established tests of reasoning ability to identify who has the skills necessary for thinking this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33367&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Gothenburg psychologists Ivar Fahsing and Karl Ask asked 166 recruits (60 women, aged around 23) from the Norwegian Police University College to complete two tests of reasoning ability. One involved deductive reasoning – the ability to apply rules to reach a correct conclusion, in this case, combining shapes to form a new target shape. The other involved inductive reasoning –  viewing different images, and using these to figure out the rule that is governing them all. These tests already feature in Norwegian police recruitment but it’s not clear whether they are useful for predicting detective skills, which are more dependent on abductive reasoning, which is much harder to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas deduction seeks linear, definitive conclusions, and induction tries to identify a category based on the available clues (“all birds, none fly”  therefore the category must be “flightless birds”), abduction amplifies the known information to generate imaginative possibilities (“an open wine bottle and smashed glasses could suggest a thwarted seduction… or a failed reconciliation with his wife?”). It requires a leap of logic, a creative act, hard to measure but known to differentiate stronger investigators, whether criminal or scientific. The ability to make many such leaps helps avoid premature foreclosure on the possibilities of a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fahsing and Ask were hopeful that measures of deductive and inductive reasoning would help identify better detectives because investigation isn’t rooted solely in abduction, and because different forms of reasoning ability are known to correlate (so a candidate skilful at deduction and induction ought to be skilled at abduction and therefore detective thinking too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess detection nous, the researchers asked their participants to review two case vignettes, each describing a woman missing under ambiguous circumstances, and some versions also mentioned the arrest of a suspect. The participants’ task was to outline all the possible explanations that could account for the facts. Both vignettes had been reviewed by an expert panel of detectives, who generated a “gold standard” of 9 viable hypotheses for the first and 11 for the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants tended to neglect the non-criminal hypotheses, such as the possibility the missing woman had suffered an accident. More importantly, scores on the reasoning ability tests didn’t predict their detective performance. Nor did they predict immunity to a commonly observed detecting error: becoming more narrow-minded (generating fewer hypotheses) after reading that a suspect had been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current data suggest that commonly used cognitive assessments are unlikely to help identify candidates with the best aptitude for becoming a detective. It seems police forces will need to think more inventively about the actual skills that contribute to good detection if they are to succeed in separating the Maigrets from the Clouseaus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Collaborates on Recommendations to Improve Transparency for Author Contributions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8076</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/hMjMgXXat38/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/02/Dichroic_filters_690x320px-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a new report, a group convened by the US National Academy of Sciences and including a dozen journal editors reflects on authorship guidelines and recommends new ways to make author contributions more transparent. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What does it mean to be author number seven on a twenty-five–author article?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing transparency for each author’s role in a research study is one of the recommendations in a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/26/1715374115&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report published today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) by a group led by Marcia McNutt, President of the National Academy of Sciences. The recommendations issued by this group, which included one of us, were adapted based on community feedback and peer review from an original draft presented as a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/20/140228&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. PLOS supports the recommendations for increased transparency and has already put some of them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more systematic description of author contributions is a prerequisite to providing due credit for roles that are instrumental to the research enterprise, especially those roles that are too often ignored or devalued. For example, collecting, curating and sharing a dataset or developing a new methodological approach that can be reused by others are key contributions that may not always land a ‘first author position’ but have applications beyond a single article and deserve recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency also brings more accountability to a system where questionable and even detrimental practices (such as guest, ghost or conscripted authorship) have been documented. While transparency requirements cannot entirely eliminate abuse, transparent description of individual author contributions can deter inaccurate representations and can expose institutionalized authorship practices that should be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, a concern often heard about emphasizing contributions is that they risk diluting individual author responsibility for the overall integrity of a study. The recommendations address this concern by stipulating authorship standards that require each author to be “personally accountable for [their] own contributions and to ensure that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work, even ones in which the author was not personally involved, are appropriately investigated, resolved, and the resolution documented in the literature.” Thus, having one’s contributions precisely described does not absolve any author of responsibility for the accuracy and rigor of the entire study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also recommends mechanisms by which publishers can bring a minimum level of standardization to the description of author contributions. In particular, the group advocates for the implementation of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orcid.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ORCID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; identifiers and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.casrai.org/Contributor_Roles&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CRediT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; taxonomy as emerging standards in the industry. While many journals already require specification of author contributions, a more fully integrated system of persistent identifiers (like ORCID iDs for authors and DOIs for articles) connected via a standardized vocabulary of relationships (like the CRediT taxonomy for contributions) will make the information both human- and machine-readable and allow it to be surfaced more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS journals have adopted both &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/01/author-credit-plos-orcid-update/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ORCID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CRediT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; since 2016; the roles and ORCID iDs provided by authors are now visible with one click on the author name in the by-line. ORCID information is passed on to CrossRef, which updates ORCID records with authors’ permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experience, the CRediT taxonomy has worked well, but the definition of some individual terms could be improved. In particular, those related to data may benefit from some refinement to distinguish generation of data from its subsequent curation. As others examine the possibility of using the taxonomy, we encourage a collaborative approach with CASRAI’s CRediT Committee, the taxonomy steward, to match the needs of different communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all roles in the CRediT taxonomy immediately qualify a participant for authorship; that qualification is determined by journal policy. To determine who should be an author, PLOS currently follows the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icmje.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICMJE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) for medical journals which posits that authorship should be associated with a substantive intellectual contribution as well as participation in drafting or revising the manuscript. While &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/authorship&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; checks that all four ICMJE criteria are met by all authors, the experience at other PLOS journals indicates that in fields outside medicine, not all authors state they have participated in the drafting or revising of the manuscript. The proposed adaptation of authorship criteria in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/26/1715374115&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;current PNAS report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes writing as a &lt;em&gt;qualification&lt;/em&gt; for authorship but does not &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; it, aims not to exclude important contributors from authorship. Conversely, the inclusion of writing without other intellectual contribution to a study as a role worthy of authorship may not find acceptance in all disciplines. The intent is not to impose a monolithic approach to authorship, but to accommodate a broad range of community standards transparently. When contributors do not meet authorship criteria, CRediT can also serve to document their precise contributions as acknowledged colleagues, supported by other means of credit like citations of protocols and datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/Transparency_Author_Contributions.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the report’s authors commit to reflect upon and improve current authorship guidelines and practices at the journals they represent, and they encourage other journals to do the same. Such introspection and subsequent discussion are timely, as research studies are increasingly large-scale and multi-disciplinary affairs. As more work goes into providing due credit for scholarly contributions like methods development, data collection and data sharing, transparency in authorship roles should advance in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competing Interests Disclosure: Veronique Kiermer is an author of the recommendations discussed and Chair of the ORCID Board. Larry Peiperl serves on the ICMJE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence tests are meant to tell you something about a person’s inherent abilities. But what if the results are distorted by the motivation to perform well? That would undermine the tests’ validity and have important implications for their use in education and recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to find out whether motivation affects intelligence test performance is to offer people a financial incentive for doing well and see if this helps them get a higher score. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12288/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/i&gt; has done this, finding that while a financial incentive boosted people’s self-declared effort levels, it failed to lift their performance. This result is good news for the validity of intelligence testing. Or as the paper’s author, Gilles Gignac at the University of Western Australia, put it: “The position of a causal effect of test-taking motivation on intelligence test performance in adults does not, yet, appear to be clearly tenable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33349&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background to this research is a controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/04/19/1018601108&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2011 by Angela Duckworth (of Grit fame) and her colleagues which suggested that motivation distorts IQ test performance, thereby challenging the validity of IQ tests as a pure measure of ability. However, only 2 of the 46 samples included in that meta-analysis featured adults, and the findings from those adult samples were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To plug this gap, Gignac recruited 99 undergrads and asked them to complete various intelligence tests, including of basic “processing speed”, working memory, fluid intelligence (measured using Raven’s progressive matrices) and crystallised intelligence (based on a vocab test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gignac split the tests in half so that the participants completed two very similar testing sessions in succession: one without any financial incentive and one with the chance to win $75 if they were among the top 10 per cent of performers (some participants did the session with this incentive first, others did it second). After each session, the participants completed a survey about how much effort they had put in and how important they thought the tests were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial incentive didn’t affect the participants’ perception of the importance of the tests. However it affected their effort levels, at least according to their self-reports. Those participants who had the financial incentive session in their first session subsequently reported less effort in their second session. In contrast, those who had the financial incentive in the second session managed to sustain their effort levels. “It may be claimed with some confidence that financial incentives can, on average, increase the amount of effort testees apply to complete cognitive tasks,” Gignac said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, this effect on effort did not translate into any difference in performance. Participants’ actual performance on all the various tests was the same across both sessions, suggesting that the financial incentive failed to boost their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prior studies, in children and adults, have found that people’s self-reported effort correlates with their IQ. That is, people who are more intelligent – at least according to their higher test results – tend to say that they tried harder. Of course this doesn’t mean that greater effort is causing the superior performance. And the new results are among the first in adults to suggest strongly that it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this study makes a useful contribution, it doesn’t settle the matter. Remember the financial incentive did not affect participants’ belief in the importance of the tests. Perhaps a bigger or different kind of incentive may affect test performance, especially if it manages to harness people’s intrinsic motivation by making them think it is very important to do well (for instance, imagine feeling highly motivated after being told that your test performance would be used to rate the ability of your country or your university). Another thing is that the participants in the new study all scored fairly high in terms of their effort levels, even without financial incentive. It remains possible that financial incentives may affect intelligence test performance but only among people who have very low motivation to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, though, it is safe to say there is little evidence that differences in motivation undermine the validity of intelligence tests taken by adults. However, Gignac concluded, “as absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, we encourage more research to help understand precisely why test-taking motivation and intelligence test scores are correlated positively in both children and adults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12288/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;A moderate financial incentive can increase effort, but not intelligence test performance in adult volunteers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Rare Disease Day Spotlight on PLOS Authors: Open Data Repositories in Practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8056</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/frgJf61zACA/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/02/Rare-Diesase-Open-Data_blog-image2-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science increasingly involves collaborative research groups, program partnerships and shared learnings to encourage transparency, reproducibility and a responsible transition to a more open way of doing science. Open Science policies and best practices are currently under discussion, definition and development across the wide spectrum of activities that make up the research cycle, from open notebooks, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/open-data&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and transparent peer review to the interoperability of meta-data and digital identifiers. In particular for open research practices, adoption of emergent and recent policies (i.e. PLOS Data Policy) could be strengthened if accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;examples of successful implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Examples can serve as a powerful motivator for improved understanding and behavioral change for those confronted with the uncertainties of a more open landscape for the practice and communication of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s a question of making clear to the broad stakeholder community, at all stages and across multiple disciplines, the practical benefit of these polices moving us all toward a more Open Science. It’s not just a theoretical pursuit of Open Science for the sake of being open. The current energy behind Open Science in the European Union, as well as in the United States, stems also from a frustration over wasted resources, time and talent. Practicing Open Science well does enhance reproducibility through improved clarity of methods and reagents, and accelerated reuse of data and code by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Celebration of Open Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit of open data is that data can be reused, not only for validation work but also for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006945&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pushing science forward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Teams of scientists with diverse expertise collaborated to explore&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/up-for-a-challenge&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preexisting data sets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to advance breast cancer research, in the US National Cancer Institute’s Up For A Challenge (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3157598/wiki/232604&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U4C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) Contest. Finalists in the US National Institutes of Health, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Wellcome Trust &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/open-data-projects-win-wellcome-trust-nih-and-hhmi-open-science-prize/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Science Prize competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (which included projects by PLOS authors and their related publications) “demonstrated the huge potential for data to be reused to develop new applications and uncover new knowledge,” wrote Robert Kiley, Head of Open Research, and David Carr, Programme Manager, Wellcome Trust, in Figshare’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/articles/_/5481187&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;State of Open Data Report 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The report provided insight into how researchers approach publishing their data. In response to surveys asking where they published their data, researchers most commonly did so as an appendix to an article (slightly over 30%) or in a data repository (slightly under 30%), with 20% having published data in a data journal (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/articles/The_State_of_Open_Data_2017_Report_-_Infographic/5519155&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see the summary infographic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opendataday.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (March 3, 2018) is an opportunity to showcase the benefits of open data and open data systems, and, according to the grassroots collective’s website, “to encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society around the world.” This year, the focus is on four key areas where open data can help solve universal problems: opening research data, tracking public money flows, informing open mapping projects and providing open data for equal development. In Copenhagen, Open Data Day will include announcement of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dk.okfn.org/2018/02/13/join-us-for-open-data-day-2018-in-copenhagen/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Danish Open Data Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and in London activities are planned related to Open Science and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://goldsmiths.tech/data&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reproducible research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Participants in The Philippines will benefit from a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ilead.ph/2018/02/20/open-data-day-rtd-on-open-research-in-the-philippines/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roundtable discussion on open research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as it applies locally and globally. There are no shortage of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opendataday.org/#resources&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ideas and data &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opendataday.org/#resources&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for Open Data Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Publisher Actions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS took a leadership position in open data in 2014 with our strengthened Data Policy, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2015/07/02/plos-recommended-data-repositories/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; our journals maintain a list of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommended repositories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to help authors share their data. When we assess repositories for inclusion in our list we are guided by criteria that meet the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAIR principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on open data. We consider this our responsibility as a publisher. The FAIR guiding principles state that beyond making data open as an important component in the data ecosystem, data also need to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. For inclusion on PLOS’ list of recommended repositories, several criteria were developed, some of which are listed below. For a more complete description of repository criteria, visit the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EveryONE blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on Open Data Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datasets should be available at no cost. &lt;/strong&gt;All PLOS articles are available to readers free of charge and we believe cost should not be a barrier to access either the scientific literature or accompanying datasets. Repositories are not considered for our recommended list if they charge readers access or subscription fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repository with stated licensing policies should offer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CC 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt; licenses (or equivalents&lt;/strong&gt;), for maximum reproducibility and reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ensure that datasets will be permanently accessible at the specified location, repositories must &lt;strong&gt;issue a stable identifier at publication, such as a digital object identifier (DOI) or an equally robust accession number&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAIRsharing.org works with a community of journals, funders and databases in support of standards, polices and educational material to enable funders, librarians, journals, researchers and developers to thrive in the open data world. &lt;strong&gt;The repository chosen by PLOS authors should have an entry created in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAIRsharing database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, to allow it to be linked to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/recommendation/PLOS&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to considering the PLOS Data Policy and providing a Data Availability Statement for their individual data and datasets, selecting the appropriate data repository is an important part of a researcher’s overall experimental and data plan. To assist authors in choosing the best repository, in addition to the current list of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommended repositories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the complete list of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/03/01/criteria-for-recommended-data-repositories/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repository criteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will soon be available on PLOS journal websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Researcher Participation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the practical importance of open data? As one specific example we can look to a coincidence of timing: February 28 is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rarediseaseday.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rare Disease Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rare diseases constitute a group of more than 6,000 different diseases and affect more than 300 million people worldwide. To put this number in perspective, 1 in 20 people live with a rare disease in their life, according to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurordis.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EURORDIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an alliance of over 700 patient organizations from nearly 70 countries in Europe. In light of Rare Disease Day’s close temporal alignment with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opendataday.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we highlight a selection of articles on rare diseases published at PLOS that utilize a variety of repository options to best make their associated data available. These are examples of authors doing the right thing to advance rare disease research, collective knowledge, and future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176562&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sorenson et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; used the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) repository to store their genomic and transcriptomic data relating to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(a rare variant of liver cancer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188943&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guilhem et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;used the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Data Archiving and Networking Services (DANS) EASY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; repository to deposit data files from their research on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_hemorrhagic_telangiectasia&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (a disease leading to abnormal blood vessel formation). The EASY repository is one of PLOS’ recommended repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116966&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andersen et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;carried out a bibliometric analysis on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; research (a cancer of white blood cells). Few, if any, dedicated repositories exist exclusively for bibliometric work, so data underlying work like this can be deposited to a discipline-independent repository—in this case &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. While subject-specific repositories are preferred, in cases where they are not available authors may use a cross-disciplinary repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006037&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hytönen et al. (2016)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published genome data relating to their work on three rare bone diseases in the European Nucleotide Archive (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ENA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) hosted by EMBL-EBI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133607&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Piersanti et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also used the GEO repository to store their microarray data on gene expression changes in brain cells following infection with viral vectors. This work contributes to the development of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that could be used in the treatment of several rare diseases affecting the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme for Rare Disease Day this year is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/optimism-on-rare-disease-day-with-research-possibilities-are-limitless/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;carry-over from last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—research. If scientists working in these disease areas make their data open and available for reuse and re-examination, they can extend the impact of their efforts and may open a window to unrealized diagnoses, therapies and perhaps even cures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of Open Science, practical and even incremental change has the power and potential to bolster momentum and encourage a spirit of collaboration that ultimately brings about large-scale cultural shift. We have seen evidence of this most recently with the preprint movement in biomedical and life sciences. Making open data the norm, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2017/06/05/new-icmje-requirements-and-the-plos-data-policy/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whenever possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and following FAIR sharing principles are additional practices that, like preprints, have the capacity to transform the work and culture of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7061842&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Communications LinkedIn Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to stay up to date on author interviews, research and organisation highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>When the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences retracted a gene therapy paper in December, it declared that some of the data had been falsified and mentioned a research misconduct investigation. But the notice said nothing about who was responsible.

	<description>A chemistry journal has retracted a nanoparticle paper following heavy outcry from readers, who alleged the paper contained signs of obvious manipulation. After the paper appeared in 2017, one critic lamented it contained “obviously fabricated” images, and asked the journal to retract it. Another suggested the presence of one image merited “an instant lifetime ban.” … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/26/chemistry-journal-retracts-highly-criticized-paper/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Chemistry journal retracts highly criticized paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies of mindfulness schools programmes for teenagers have produced mixed results, with some failing to find benefits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/26/perhaps-teens-are-too-cynical-to-benefit-from-mindfulness-say-authors-of-latest-negative-school-trial/&quot;&gt;even when extra features were added&lt;/a&gt; to try to make them more effective. But given the demonstrated benefits of mindfulness training on stress and wellbeing in adults – and the urgent need to find ways to reduce stress and prevent depression in teenagers – it’s not surprising that researchers are pursuing work in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of mindfulness for kids may, then, take some comfort from &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12646/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/em&gt; that found an 8-week training programme improved emotion processing in 16-18-year-olds. In theory, this might reduce their vulnerability to depression, write the researchers, from Bangor University, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33326&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was not large: it involved just 40 sixth-form pupils (aged 16 to 18) from north Wales. Twenty-one pupils from two schools acted as controls, while 19 from two other schools formed the training group. Regular teachers from these schools delivered the “Foundations” version of the .b mindfulness curriculum, originally developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindfulnessinschools.org&quot;&gt;Mindfulness in Schools Project&lt;/a&gt; for busy adults, and which consists of eight 50-minute sessions (the researchers said they chose this programme to “reflect the maturity of the age group targeted for this intervention”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start and end of the study period, all the pupils completed a number of questionnaires, including the Perceived Stress Scale, a self-assessment of empathy, and a version of the WHO Well-Being Index. The researchers also used electroencephalography (EEG) to provide a brainwave measure of the teenagers’ sensitivity to happy, sad and neutral male and female faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the training, the mindfulness group did not score higher for empathy or lower for stress than the controls. But they did report feeling greater well-being. And the EEG data showed that, unlike the controls, they sustained their sensitivity to the faces that had happy or sad expressions, rather than becoming habituated to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tentatively, we can interpret the findings as suggesting that mindfulness practice, which encourages curiosity and exposure to emotion without judgement or reactivity, can help maintain attention on socially relevant stimuli,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the so-called Emotion Content Insensitivity model, depression is characterised by a lack of response to both positive and negative emotional stimuli. So, in theory, maintaining a sensitivity to happy and sad faces may reduce these pupils’ vulnerability to depression, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be said that there are a quite a lot of “maybes” in the conclusions of this study. And while there were some potentially encouraging trends in the data (in relation to empathy, for example), only a few of the positive results were statistically significant. Also, the final assessments came soon after the training finished, so there’s no way of knowing how long the slight improvements shown by the mindfulness group would have lasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, “we hope that future work will build on these initial findings and explore the long-term effects of mindfulness training on adolescents,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, every teacher and parent would like to see effective interventions to reduce stress and the risk of depression in teenagers. But whether mindfulness is the answer is yet to be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12646/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;Effects of school-based mindfulness training on emotion processing and well-being in adolescents: evidence from event-related potentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A new Lancet paper about antidepressants caused quite a stir this week. Headlines proclaimed that &quot;It's official - antidepressants work&quot;, &quot;Study proves anti-depressants are effective&quot;, and &quot;Antidepressants work. Period.&quot;



Wew.

The truth is that while the Lancet paper is a nice piece of work, it tells us very little that we didn't already know, and it has a number of limitations. The media reaction to the paper is frankly bananas, as we'll see below.

Here's why the new study doesn't t</description>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: In memoriam: Jimmie C. Holland, MD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=136634</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/528121437/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jimmie C. Holland, MD, internationally recognized as the founder of the field of Psycho-oncology, died suddenly on 24 December 2017 at the age of 89. Dr. Holland, who was affectionately known by her first name, “Jimmie,” had a profound global influence on the fields of Psycho-oncology, Psychosomatic Medicine, and Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holland was the Attending Psychiatrist and Wayne E. Chapman Chair at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Professor of Psychiatry, Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York. In 1977, she was appointed Chief of the Psychiatry Service in the Department of Neurology at MSK. The Psychiatry Service at MSK was the first such clinical, research, and training service established in any cancer center in the world. In 1996, Dr. Holland was named the inaugural Chairwoman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MSK Cancer Center, also the first such department created in any cancer center in the world. Over 25 years ago, Dr. Holland founded and co-edited the international &lt;em&gt;Psycho-Oncology &lt;/em&gt;journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;557&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DRU-367eCmE.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;Dr. Jimmie Holland. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Dr. William Breitbart. Not to be reused without permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holland edited the first major textbooks of Psycho-oncology, and in 1989 edited the &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Psychooncology: Psychological care of the patient with cancer&lt;/em&gt;. This landmark textbook was notable for several reasons; it established a “new” field, a subspecialty of both Psychosomatics and oncology. I remember being a young faculty member in Dr. Holland’s service and the very real sense that we were creating something that had not existed before. I remember her asking me to write multiple chapters, including several in which I had very little expertise. I expressed my concern, “I’m not an expert on the psychiatric complications of head and neck cancer!” She calmly reassured me, “Well, Bill, no one is. So when you finish researching and writing the chapter I suppose then you’ll be the world’s expert!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psycho-oncology was born and named with the publication of this textbook and with Dr. Holland’s founding of the International Psycho-oncology Society (IPOS) in 1984, then the American Psychosocial Oncology Society in 1986. Subsequently, Dr. Holland edited, with a group of co-editors, what became known as the “Bible” of Psycho-oncology; &lt;em&gt;Psycho-oncology&lt;/em&gt; was published in 1998, and represented the most comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and international encyclopedia of a field entering its adolescence. 2010 saw the publication of the second edition followed by the third edition in 2015. Every card-carrying “psycho-oncologist” (in 57 countries with national psycho-oncology societies) had to have the latest edition in their library to demonstrate their link to Jimmie Holland. Dr. Holland also co-wrote two well received books for the public: &lt;em&gt;The Human Side of Cancer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lighter as We Go: Virtues, Character Strengths, and Aging&lt;/em&gt;, the latter reflecting her interests in Geriatric Oncology as she approached her 90th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holland was born in the small farming community of Nevada, Texas in 1928. She credits the local family physician in that community for her interest in medicine and caring for those who were suffering. She was one of only three women in her class at Baylor College of Medicine. In 1956, Dr. Holland married the renowned oncology pioneer James Holland, MD, who was then Chief of Medical Oncology at Roswell Park in Buffalo, NY. She would chide James, complaining that cancer patients were asked every conceivable question about their physical functioning but never, “How do you feel emotionally?” Dr. Holland pioneered the inclusion of psychological and emotional well-being patient-reported outcomes in quality of life measures and as a component of clinical outcomes in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

Holland. Image courtesy of Dr. William Breitbart. Not to be reused without permission&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holland has received too many awards to list, however some notable ones include: The Medal of Honor for Clinical Research from the American Cancer Society, The Marie Curie Award from the Government of France, and the Margaret L. Kripke Legend Award for contributions to the advancement of women in cancer medicine and cancer science from the MD Anderson Cancer Center. She served as President of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (APM) in 1996 and was the recipient of the APM’s Hackett Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. She was also the inaugural recipient of the Arthur Sutherland Award for Lifetime Achievement from IPOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a 40-year career at MSK Cancer Center, Dr. Holland created and nurtured the field of Psycho-oncology, established its clinical practice, advanced its clinical research agenda, and through her pioneering efforts, launched the careers of the leaders of a national and worldwide field who mourn her passing and continue to work in what has become a shared mission to emphasize the &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stepping down as Chairman of the MSK Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in 2003, she kept working full time, seeing patients, conducting research, training and supervising fellows, and traveling the world lecturing and teaching. She also helped bring Psycho-oncology to Africa through her work with the African Organization for Cancer Research &amp;amp; Training in Cancer (AORTIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in a humble farming community with a one room school house, Dr. Holland created a life that led her to New York and the capitals of the world, honored by so many organizations and societies. She was teaching and seeing patients up until two days before her death. I think we’ll all remember her for various reasons. I certainly have many memories from a 34 year career working beside her. But on that list was her generosity and loving attitude towards her family, her patients, her colleagues, trainees, and everyone who crossed her path. Those who worked alongside her in medicine have made her mission our mission. We will continue this mission’s work, always remembering and honoring Dr. Jimmie Holland. Her death is a profound loss for all of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine, Psycho-oncology, and Oncology. We’ve lost a pioneer, a remarkable woman, a once-in-a-generation influencer.&lt;/p&gt;

performing symbolic integration and differentiations, it has the added benefit
that it can be used seamlessly as a part of regular Python programs. I will

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Adopting a more active lifestyle today could have benefits for your personality decades from now</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/23/adopting-a-more-active-lifestyle-today-could-have-benefits-for-your-personality-decades-from-now/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhf.org.uk/publications/statistics/physical-inactivity-report-2017&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; published by the British Heart Foundation, we spend 76 days per year, on average, sitting. The World Health Organisation describes physical inactivity as a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_inactivity/en/&quot;&gt;global public health problem&lt;/a&gt;” that contributes to millions of deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be surprised to hear about the harmful health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, but perhaps less obvious is that physical inactivity is also associated with unwelcome changes in personality over time. Previous research has documented these effects over periods of four and ten years. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300175&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt; has extended this, finding that greater physical inactivity at baseline is associated with deterioration in personality two decades later, even after accounting for any differences in initial personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers, led by Yannick Stephan at Université de Montpellier, point out, there is an upside: the findings suggest that even a moderate increase in your activity levels today could have positive implications for your personality decades from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33331&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers combined data from three long-running survey studies. Two involved over 6000 participants in Wisconsin, first recruited between 1992 and 1994, aged 53 on average, when they completed a personality questionnaire and answered questions about their physical activity levels. These same participants then repeated the personality questionnaire in 2011. The other study was US-wide and involved over 2500 participants who first took part between 1995 to 1996, aged 46, on average, when they answered questions about their personality and physical activity. The same participants then provided follow-up personality data in 2013-2014. All the studies also recorded extensive information about the participants’ health and any illnesses or psychological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main take-away is that greater physical inactivity at baseline was associated with sharper declines in conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openness, as measured two decades later, even after factoring out baseline personality and any differences in health. The pattern also wasn’t moderated by race, age, education or sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sense of perspective about the size of these links: the associations between physical inactivity and personality change were mostly either as great as, or even greater than, the associations between demographic factors and personality change, and between disease burden and personality change (in a multiple regression on data combined from the three studies, and controlling for other factors like health, the β value for the inactivity and personality correlations was between -.03 and -.06).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These patterns generally held across different intensities of physical activity (the researchers were able to look separately at light physical activity, such as gardening; moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking; and vigorous activity, such as running or lifting weights). However, for extraversion and agreeableness, there was a suggestion that a lack of moderate physical activity might be especially relevant in terms of later declines in these traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may not usually think of physical activity as contributing to our personalities, in fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180221-the-hidden-side-to-your-personality&quot;&gt;there is a close association between personality and our basic physiology&lt;/a&gt;, including our responsiveness to stress. Another part of the reason that lower physical activity may have such long-term links with personality may be due to knock-on consequences of inactivity for our physical capabilities, which will impact the kind of lives we are able to lead. Being less active may also contribute to us becoming less self-disciplined, less curious and adventurous. We will have fewer opportunities for socialising and also miss the mood-enhancing effects of exercise, a detriment that may accumulate over time and potentially contribute to our lower agreeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat unexpected, but consistent with previous research, was the relative lack of an association between inactivity and later higher trait neuroticism (or emotional instability). However there was one exception: lower vigorous physical activity at baseline was associated with higher neuroticism two decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper includes a large number of participants and covers an impressive time span. However, it’s far from perfect. It mostly pertains to changes between mid-life and older age. There is also no data on what happened earlier in the participants’ lives – perhaps the participants’ personalities in their youth influenced both their later activity levels and the later trajectories of their trait changes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/18/hate-sport-maybe-its-because-you-have-the-genes-that-make-exercise-feel-awful/&quot;&gt;Genetic differences&lt;/a&gt; between the participants could be another major confound, potentially influencing personality trajectories and activity levels. It’s worth noting too that we don’t know how the participants’ activity levels changed over the course of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings reinforce the increasingly well-established idea that personality and health are closely interwoven, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/07/longest-ever-personality-study-finds-no-correlation-between-measures-taken-at-age-14-and-age-77/&quot;&gt;personality is relatively malleable across the life-span&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that being more active is good for our health, this new paper brings home that it’s probably good for our personalities too. Something to ponder when you next decide whether to walk or drive to the shops. “It is likely that the benefits of even a small increase in physical activity may accumulate over time, resulting in significant [positive] personality change,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/pregnant-1-e1518712534422-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1279-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors Influencing Choice of Birth Place Setting from the Perspective of Healthy Women in the UK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternity care policy in England has opened the doors for women to choose their birth setting. With this change in policy, women now have the options to give birth in a hospital obstetrics unit, a freestanding midwifery unit, with a midwife affiliated with an obstetric unit, or plan a home birth. Despite the options provided, in recent years it has been observed that only 13% of women take advantage of non-obstetric unit settings. Previous studies have suggested that women chose one birth option over another due to the perceived level of safety in hospitals, a lack of information related to non-obstetric birth units, or sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this systematic review, 20 research articles were assessed using the best fit framework, delving into what influences women’s decisions based on their perspective. This study found women were influenced by the level of information they received regarding each birth setting, the opinions of healthcare providers, family and friends, the characteristics of the services provided, perceived level of associated risk, and experiences with previous births.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study found that each birth setting had its positive attributes and factors that concerned women. Women often relied on hospitals due to access to facilities in the event something went wrong as well as access to pain relief. Conversely, women often felt that hospitals were not as personal as other birthing options. Women who decided to deliver at home or use a midwifery affiliated unit felt that it was a more relaxed setting and that they had a greater sense of control and a relationship with the person caring for them.  Alternatively, women in this setting felt they had to do extra research to gain the appropriate information outside of what was provided to them and worried about what would happen in the event they needed to transfer to a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study concluded that women with a low-risk pregnancy found giving birth in a hospital more straightforward than non-hospitals births. Overall, these opinions were shaped by each woman’s personal experience and pre-existing opinion, despite the access to multiple forms of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1566-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements for safe obstetric anesthesia are rarely met in hospitals in Uganda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9940 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/surgery-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe surgery and anesthesia are critical to comprehensive emergency obstetric care.  International standards of safe practice have been formulated to address the needs of low- and middle-income countries to improve the quality and safety of surgical procedures using anesthesia.  However, small studies across East Africa have shown that these standards are not being met by hospitals offering obstetric anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epiu &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; conducted a large, cross-sectional survey of 64 hospitals in Uganda, both public and private, to assess adherence to guidelines for safe anesthesia. They found that only 5% met all the requirements set out by the international guidelines while 8% had no trained providers for anesthesia at all. Many hospitals lacked some of the equipment necessary for monitoring of anesthesia and the authors noted that much of the equipment present was obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the need to strengthen obstetric and general anesthesia services in Uganda by increasing training and access to equipment. These improvements would play an important role in meeting United Nations goals for reducing the maternal mortality ratio by providing safe cesarean section services when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9941 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/meditation-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Past research suggests th&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;at fear of childbirth is highest among first-time mothers. This fear not only predicts the use of pain medication, but it is linked to perinatal and postpartum depression, puts women at a higher risk for poor postpartum adjustment, and can act as a predictor of poor outcomes for labor and birth. In order to provide first time mothers with a resource to combat fear of childbirth, Duncan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt; conducted a randomized controlled trial implementing a mindfulness-based childbirth workshop. In the trial, the intervention group utilized the workshop while the control group underwent standard preparations for childbirth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop, titled “Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth,” was an 18-hour program, utilized in the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; trimester for both the mothers and their partners. The MIL workshop taught the participants yoga, walking meditation, partner touch, mindful breathing, and instruction grounded in mindfulness as strategies to cope with labor-related stress. The mindfulness strategies used in the study are based on a nine-week Mindfulness-based Childbirth and Parenting program which in turn is based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. The overall goal of the workshop was to teach women the traditional topics needed for childbirth preparation, how to become more aware of their bodies, separate the cognitive and emotional aspects of pain and replace it with the goal to decrease fear, and show participants ways to cope and support each other throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this trial found that there was a reduced rate of opioid analgesia in the MIL group as compared to controls, but no reduction in the overall rate of epidural or perceived pain retrospectively. The results also suggested that participants in the MIL group had marginally fewer perinatal and postpartum depression symptoms as compared to the controls. Most notably, participants in the MIL group were significantly more likely to feel confident in their behaviors throughout labor. In conclusion, a mindfulness based approach to childbirth preparation is promising avenue for continued research in reducing fear of childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-016-1197-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of care providers in birth trauma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth trauma, an extreme negative experience during childbirth that can result from a number of factors, can lead to ongoing poor mental health, affecting the woman herself, her relationship to her family, and her ability to bond with her child. A number of studies have identified a perceived lack of control of decision-making as a major factor in the experience of birth trauma.  Additionally, a lack of emotional support of women during birth has also been identified as a risk factor for birth trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study by Reed, Sharman, and Inglis, from our collection ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen&quot;&gt;The Role of Structural and Interpersonal Violence in the Lives of Women&lt;/a&gt;,’ nearly 750 women out of over 900 who completed an online survey answered an open-ended question about birth trauma. While one third of them described birth trauma related to medical concerns or adverse events, the other two thirds described trauma relating to care provider actions and how they were treated during labor and birth. Accounts of trauma included care providers disregarding or not seeking women’s preferences regarding interventions, women not being believed regarding onset of labor or timing of pushing, outright lies and threats to coerce women into consenting to interventions, and physical violations such as internal examinations on women who had explicitly not consented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These experiences were common across cultural contexts and birth settings.  This highlights the global nature of the problem and the need for maternity services to comply with recommendations from the World Health Organization and others regarding women-centered maternity services and potentially unnecessary medical interventions. In addition, it contributes to ongoing debate about the accuracy and efficacy of standards and assessments used during labor and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of recorded time, humanity has been fascinated by the figure of the wise person, wending their path through the tribulations of life, and informing those willing to learn. What sets them apart? Maybe that’s the wrong question. In a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-02884-003&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;European Psychologist&lt;/i&gt;, Igor Grossman of the University of Waterloo argues that understanding wisdom involves taking the wise off their pedestal, and seeing wisdom as a set of processes that we can all tap into, with the right attitude, and in the right context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33322&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom might seem to be a difficult concept for psychologists to study, but Grossman says there is some agreement now that it comprises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/&quot;&gt;Intellectual humility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciating broader perspectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing that social relations can change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A willingness to compromise or integrate different opinions together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen this way, wisdom is distinct from things like creativity and intelligence, while being associated with related phenomena like emotion regulation, cooperative intentions, and political even-handedness (e.g. not condemning an opponent’s change of view as flip-flopping).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists who research wisdom tend to use questionnaires administered at one point in time to measure it, treating it as a static property. But Grossman argues that this doesn’t fit with the variability with which wisdom manifests. Experiments in the lab that asked participants to work through hypothetical situations, have found that people’s wisdom on one topic (say, the “Meaning of Life”) only gave a limited indication of their wisdom in another, like adjudicating a family issue. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/31/wisdom-is-more-of-a-state-than-a-trait/&quot;&gt;diary studies&lt;/a&gt; where participants reflect on the most difficult issue they faced each day show that wise thinking can fluctuate wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Grossman’s view, this suggests that although wisdom has some stability, the context is king. And changing the context of thinking can encourage more wise outcomes. For instance, researchers observe wiser thinking when participants are asked to consider a problem as if it occurred a year ago, rather than now, or if it’s occurring to a third party, rather than themselves. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/03/01/how-thinking-for-others-can-boost-your-creativity/&quot;&gt;distancing techniques&lt;/a&gt; help us take a less egocentric approach, trapped in the urgent “here, now, me” which pushes us to look for certainty and closure, often prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, explaining an issue you care deeply about is done in a more wise, balanced manner when you imagine that the recipient is a 12-year old, casting you as a teacher. It seems that again, seeing yourself as a teacher of someone in need of insight (rather than facing a peer in need of convincing) leads us to be less egocentric and more focused on the other, allowing us to disinvest in static certainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If different contexts can encourage wisdom, does this mean that wisdom can be taught? There’s good reason to be skeptical: in &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-31215-001&quot;&gt;a classic study&lt;/a&gt;, John Darley and Daniel Batson found that seminary students who had been preparing a talk about the Good Samaritan were no more likely to stop and help someone in need, suggesting that learning about a wise approach to living doesn’t mean that we will internalise it. And we know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/22/expert-philosophers-are-just-as-irrational-as-the-rest-of-us/&quot;&gt;moral philosophers are no more moral&lt;/a&gt; than the rest of us, suggesting that even deep training doesn’t add up to real world practical wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Grossman is optimistic, citing the fact that even undergraduate study – including in psychology – can lead to better reasoning about statistics, methodology, and practical aspects of logic. While these don’t map directly onto wisdom, they share something in their recognition of uncertainty and error in the ways we know the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of teaching wisdom suggest that this teaching could be framed around exemplars – wise figures from the past. Grossman is in favour of this, but suggests that the road to wisdom comes not from treating these figures as peerless exemplars, but as successes within a social context, and by comparing and contrasting where their wisdom apparently reached its limits and why. This is captured by the Solomon Paradox, named after the great Jewish king who also boasted of his riches and ill-prepared his son to succeed him. Grossman argues that exploring these foibles and failings – and whether, in their historical context, they were as great a failing as we now assume – leads to intellectual humility and a sense of a bigger, more complicated picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the social context into wisdom isn’t an entirely new idea. Taoism teaches us to go beyond an individual point of view, and the Socratic method involves gaining wisdom through discussion, rather than solitary rumination. So consider this new paper a reminder of what these traditions have said: that wisdom is a way, a path along which our thinking becomes proportionate, balanced and expansive, and that it’s a journey enriched by company.&lt;/p&gt;
