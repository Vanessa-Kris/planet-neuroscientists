	<description>Earlier this week, Jordan Anaya asked an interesting question on Twitter:

Why do we blame the media for reporting on bad studies but we don't blame scientists for citing bad studies?
— Omnes Res (@OmnesResNetwork) March 6, 2017
This got me thinking about what we might call the ethics of citation.



Citation is a little-discussed subject in science. Certainly, there's plenty of talk about citations - about whether it is right to judge papers by the number of citations they receive, whet</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: The ancient origins of the Chow Chow</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;ChowChow2Szczecin&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/ChowChow2Szczecin-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ChowChow2Szczecin&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8676&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/ChowChow2Szczecin.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chow Chow is an East Asian dog breed and one of the first to emerge after the domestication of the dog. It is believed that they were the models for the stone lion statues which guard Buddhist temples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chow Chows have a sturdy build, straight hind legs and very dense fur, particularly in the neck area, giving the impression of a mane. The breed also possesses more unusual features such as an extra pair of teeth (44 instead of 42) and a distinctive blue/black tongue. The temperament of the breed is said to be fiercely protective of its owners whilst being discerning towards strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From wolf to dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the species that were successfully domesticated, dogs (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupus familiaris&lt;/em&gt;) are the only large carnivore able to thrive in a human created environment. Our understanding of the history of this domestication is still far from complete and the origin of the domestic dogs’ descent from gray wolves (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupus&lt;/em&gt;) is of great debate. Various studies present conflicting conclusions, identifying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v108/n5/full/hdy2011114a.html&quot;&gt;Southern East Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/13639&quot;&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/871&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; as the geographical origin of dog domestication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know that the indigenous dogs of China and the ancient breeds from East Asia have been identified as the most basal lineages relating to gray wolves. These include breeds such as Chow Chow, Akita and Shiba Inu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to many European breeds, which underwent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7069/full/nature04338.html&quot;&gt;intense artificial selection&lt;/a&gt; over the past 500 years, Ancient East Asian breeds carry substantially more genetic variability. It has been suggested that this comparatively high genetic variability indicates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v26/n1/full/cr2015147a.html&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/a&gt; of domestic dogs is in East Asia and that this occurred around 33,000 years ago, followed by a global dispersal of dogs out of southern East Asia around 15,000 years ago. This gave rise to domestic dog populations with an ancestry gradient moving away from gray wolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Chow Chow as an example ancient East Asian dog breed, the authors of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3525-9&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; recently published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, conducted a systematic study that looked to characterize the origin of East Asian dogs. The researchers sequenced the genome of nine Chow Chows using a Restricted site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approach. This data was combined with genome sequences of 37 canid species including gray wolves, Chinese indigenous dogs and other dog breeds, all collected from previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old dogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Chow-Chow_from_1915&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8679 alignright&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Chow-Chow_from_1915.jpg&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having features like a thick coat which suggest an origin in a high altitude environment, the authors’ analysis found that Chow Chows were in fact selected from Chinese indigenous dogs which are of Southern origin. They also found that the Chow Chow and other East Asian dog breeds must have originated from Chinese indigenous dogs very early, as much as 8,300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors theorize that the selection of the Chow Chow from Chinese indigenous dogs may have been facilitated by agricultural that started near the Yangtze River around 11,000 to 9,000 years ago which created a sedentary environment for humans. They add that examining the creation of Asian dog breeds in unison with human development is an “enchanting picture waiting to be told”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of the Chow Chow breed has previously been thought of as gradual. When an emerging breed is under development, you could expect high genetic exchange with the source population due to low differentiation. However the authors found that there was a surprisingly low gene flow between Chow Chows and Chinese indigenous dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the creation of the Chow Chow breed was relatively rapid with subsequent interbreeding restricted. This mode of breed formation may be quite common among many ancient breeds as low gene flow was also found across East Asian dog breeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furry, strong and a blue tongue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8678&quot; style=&quot;width: 261px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;chow tongue&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8678 size-full&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/chow-tongue.png&quot; width=&quot;251&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The distinct blue tongue of a Chow Chow&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining the phenotype of the Chow Chow, the authors found that traits unique to the breed like a blue tongue and a thick coat are not strongly indicated in gene ontology analysis. This could mean that the coding for these distinctive phenotypes is limited to only a few genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes for traits such as muscle and heart development as well as metabolism and digestion were found to have been extensively selected for. This is consistent with knowledge that Chow Chows were kept as sporting dogs in their early development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found strong signals for selection in two genes (ASIP and PDPK1) that are associated with pigmentation in other animals and could hint at a relation to the distinctive blue/black tongue. Gene ASIP is associated with pigmentation across many animals and mutations of the gene PDPK1 causes abnormal pigmentation in mouse embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this study helps to characterize the origin of East Asian dog breeds and sheds light on the distinctive traits of the Chow Chow, a much loved breed, there is still a lot of work to be done in to unravel the complex history and definitive origin of man’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A pathology journal has retracted a 2015 paper from researchers in China after concluding the authors had falsified and copied some of the data and text. According to the notice, a “knowledgeable informant” told the journal about the overlap and “fraudulent” aspects of the paper, which the editors were able to confirm. The journal retracted the paper […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: What lies beneath: Why diversity matters in cystic fibrosis lung infections</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Colour is key: Isolates from the CF lung display striking differences in the production of a blue/green pigment associated with enhanced virulence - pyocyanin.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/figure-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease causing a build up of thick, viscous mucous in the airways, which makes CF patients highly susceptible to infections. The most common culprit is &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, &lt;/em&gt;a highly virulent opportunistic pathogen. These infections are associated with declining lung function, reduced quality of life and ultimately, premature death. To make matters worse, &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;is now resistant to virtually all commonly administered antibiotics, making it seemingly impossible to eradicate once established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;rapidly adapts to life within the CF lung via a series of genetic and phenotypic changes, including, most strikingly, the loss of many secreted proteins and sugars which are linked to virulence. The loss of these traits in chronic infections has been observed time and time again, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/103/22/8487&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17493132&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the widely-held assumption that virulence is generally bad for the bugs in chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, however, CF infections worldwide are dominated by highly transmissible epidemic strains that must retain their virulence-associated traits in order to allow them to transmit to new hosts. This prompted us to question just how universal the assumed loss of virulence-associated traits really is in CF chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible solution to this problem is that &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; populations in the CF lung are not uniform, but highly diverse. Even by sampling just a few colonies we can see diversity in clinically important traits like antibiotic resistance (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep10932&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060225&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps diversity in virulence-associated traits might explain how virulence could be reduced overall in chronic infections while still maintaining the ability for some genotypes to infect new hosts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to investigate this by quantifying phenotypic variation in&lt;em&gt; P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; isolates within the lungs of several CF patients. Our approach was different from previous studies – rather than sampling a few isolates from a large number of patients over time, we sampled 40 isolates from three samples taken from different CF patients (all at a similar stage of infection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that in two out of three patients, the bacterial populations were highly diverse in their production of secreted peptides and proteins linked to virulence, ranging from non-producing genotypes to hyper-producers which had evolved to pump out these virulence-associated secretions at very high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then was, does this variation actually matter for establishing virulent infections in a new host? We tested this in waxmoth larvae, by individually infecting single larvae with each of 40 isolates taken from a single patient sample. We found that isolates that produced higher levels of these secretions killed the waxmoths much faster than non-producing isolates, even though all of these isolates once coexisted together in the same lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work suggests that this diversity within the CF lung explains the ability of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; to transmit from patient to patient in CF clinics. In these CF infections, despite reduced virulence at the whole population level, the diversity means that there is a highly-virulent sub-population capable of causing new infections. What we don’t yet know is why the diversity evolves and how it is maintained for such long periods in the CF lung. Nonetheless, we have shown that within-patient &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; diversity matters, suggesting that accounting for diversity is key to accurately diagnosing and treating CF infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millennia, humans have enjoyed using alcohol as a social lubricant. The reasons seem obvious at first. Most of us have had a drink or two that’s put us at ease, helped us lose our inhibitions, lifted our mood. And yet, literally for decades through the last century, psychologists and other scientists struggled to find evidence for what they termed the “tension reduction theory” that proposed alcohol was rewarding because of its relaxing, mood-enhancing effects. In the lab, alcohol often had no effect or even made people feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796716301000&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; helps make sense of this mismatch between real life and the lab. Too much of the early research presumed alcohol’s effects are straightforward, that if you give a dose of alcohol to a person sat alone in a psych lab, that its pharmacological effects will kick in and make them feel jollier and less anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality, as Michael Sayette of the University of Pittsburgh explains in his review, is that alcohol’s rewarding effects interact in complex ways with our thoughts and emotions and the social situations we find ourselves in. To uncover why social drinking is so rewarding, researchers have had to develop more sophisticated, realistic experiments. Here I’ve pulled out five of the key insights from Sayette’s review that help explain why so many of us find alcohol the perfect companion when we’re socialising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20551&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol makes us stay in the moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With moderate doses of alcohol we seem less affected by past experiences, our mood is more connected to the immediate moment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcoholresearchlab.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/abn_122_3_770.pdf&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; to show this involved researchers filming small groups of strangers interacting. Comparing the changing facial emotions of those participants who’d drunk modest amounts of alcohol with those who’d drunk a non-alcoholic beverage or placebo (they thought it was alcohol but it wasn’t) showed that alcohol seemed to reduce “emotional inertia” – that is, the intoxicated participants’ current emotions were less affected by their earlier emotions. As Sayette writes in his review,  alcohol “increases the ability to experience the present moment unbound by past experience”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol reduces anxiety, but not fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate intoxication doesn’t seem to help reduce our fear of a threat that we know is definitely coming, but it does reduce our anxiety about unpredictable threats, which could help explain its appeal in social situations. An unpredictable threat is more analogous to the challenge of a social situation where you never know when you might next suffer a snub or awkward exchange. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797613499923&quot;&gt;Researchers demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; this effect of alcohol by measuring participants’ startle response to loud noises during a task in which they knew they were definitely going to receive mild electric shocks, or another in which there was uncertainty about whether they would receive a shock or not. Drinking alcohol reduced participants’ startle reaction and their subjective feelings of anxiety only when the shock threat was uncertain. “This experiment provides clear evidence that the magnitude of alcohol stress reduction is greater when there is uncertainty about the severity of the upcoming threat than when the threat is well defined,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol narrows our attentional focus making it easier to ignore worries and threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re mildly intoxicated we seem to have less spare mental capacity which means that as long as we’re currently distracted by a pleasant or non-threatening task – such as chatting with friends – our minds are less likely to have the resources left over to worry about other things. &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/97/2/196/&quot;&gt;For a study published in 1988&lt;/a&gt;, participants were either mildly intoxicated or sober, and either looked at art slides or sat quietly, after being told that they would soon have to give a speech. Being intoxicated and looking at art slides helped reduced the anxiety about the upcoming speech consistent with the “attention-allocation” model of alcohol’s effects – that is, presumably the tipsy participants were unable to fret about the upcoming speech because the artwork occupied their diminished powers of attention. Alcohol or artwork on their own did not have the same benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol boosts social bonding and the catchiness of positive emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s little wonder that early research struggled to pin down the rewarding effects of alcohol: so many of these studies involved testing participants on their own when some of alcohol’s most relevant effects seem to manifest specifically in social situations. Recent research has begun to capture these social effects. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611435134&quot;&gt;when psychologists filmed small groups of strangers&lt;/a&gt; getting to know each other, they found that those groups who were mildly intoxicated reported increased feelings of closeness with their new acquaintances and they displayed more genuine “Duchenne” smiles, as compared with sober groups or groups drinking placebo. What’s more, alcohol increased the frequency of “golden moments” when all three members of the group were showing Duchenne smiles at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men and extraverts are especially likely to experience the social benefits of moderate drinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research that’s used the same format, of filming groups of strangers getting to know each other, has found that extraverts are especially likely to report mood-enhancing and social bonding effects of alcohol, which might partly help explain why extraverts are more likely to develop problems with drinking to excess. Similarly, men seem especially receptive to alcohol’s social effects. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237323&quot;&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; that’s used conversation volume to gauge the merriment of social gatherings has found that small groups of sober women seem merrier than small groups of sober men, but this gender difference disappears when participants have had an alcoholic drink. The researchers said this shows “greater alcohol reward for male groups and thus identifies a mechanism that may support heavy drinking in male drinking contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding his review, Michael Sayette says that that there is still a lot more we need to know about social drinking: for example, a lot of the social group research has so far involved strangers, but of course much of the time we drink socially with friends in which case the precise effects of alcohol might be quite different. He also notes that these findings on social drinking could help inform new ways to help people who have problems with controlling their alcohol consumption. For instance, by better understanding the rewarding psychological effects of alcohol, clinicians might be better placed to help clients find different, potentially healthier ways to increase their enjoyment of socialising.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During the last decade, a variety of platforms for neuromorphic computing, so-called neuromorphic hardware systems, have been introduced by different players in academia and industry. They are often praised as promising systems for future computing, especially now that conventional processors don’t get faster anymore. But what is this “neuromorphic hardware” after all, and what are the promises it holds? In my presentation I will give an overview on the neuromorphic technologies that we can access through the Human Brain Project. I will also present results from a recent study where we compared the performance of neuromorphic systems to conventional technologies. This study sheds light on constraints of neuromorphic systems, and opportunities to overcome them. Finally, I will provide an outlook on how neuromorphic sensory computation might look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Orange = increased grey matter, blue = decrease. Via University of Michigan&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling in space can play havoc with the human mind. Because of micro-gravity, astronauts frequently experience weird sensory effects, such as the world suddenly appearing upside down. Even their ability to rotate objects in their mind’s eye is sometimes affected. A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-016-0001-9&quot;&gt;open-access study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Microgravity&lt;/em&gt; is the first to explore the structural brain changes caused by spaceflight and which may contribute to, or reflect, these and other sensory and cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Koppelmans and his colleagues, including Jacob Bloomberg at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, compared brain scans taken of 27 astronauts before a space mission with a second scan taken once they were back on earth. The results revealed a mix of shrinkage and enlargement across the brain. There were widespread reductions in grey matter as well as some more localised increases in grey matter in regions that are involved in sensory processing and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20474&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen of the scanned astronauts had taken part in shuttle missions lasting around two weeks, the others had visited the International Space Station for a period of around six months. The pre-mission scans were conducted a median of 194 days before the mission, usually after significant amount of astronaut training had already been completed, which helps reduce, but not eliminate, the possibility that any observed brain changes were caused by training rather than spaceflight. The post-mission scans were taken between one to twenty days after landing back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, after experiencing spaceflight, the astronauts’ brains had shrunk in various frontal and temporal regions and in the cerebellum (a region at the back of the brain involved in coordination, among other things). This is fairly similar to what’s been found in a previous study of the effects of 70 days’ bed rest on brain structure, which was intended to be an approximate simulation of micro-gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koppelmans and his colleagues think these widespread grey matter reductions – which were more extensive in astronauts who’d spent longer in space – might be caused by the way that micro-gravity leads to increased fluid pressure in the brain leading to a gradual upward shift of the brain’s centre of mass in the skull  (our bodies usually compensate for the downward pull of gravity on internal fluids; when gravity is reduced, the compensation processes continue, leading to pressure build up in the head and brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there were also some more localised areas in which brain volume appeared to have increased, on average, including in parts of the parietal lobe, which are involved in motor control. This might reflect changes to brain structure involved in the astronauts’ adaptation to a micro-gravity environment. However, the magnitude of these brain changes did not correlate with the amount of balance problems that the astronauts showed after landing back on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study marks a useful start in understanding how spaceflight affects the physical structure of the brain, which in turn could help inform counter-measures to help astronauts adapt to microgravity during flight and then cope with adapting back to life on earth. However, as the researchers acknowledge, the results are speculative because of the many methodological drawbacks. For example, the fact the astronauts had a range of spaceflight experiences and the initial brain scans were sometimes taken many months before take-off means that the study lacked precision. Moreover, some of the astronauts already had earlier spaceflight experiences, which may have already altered their brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-016-0001-9&quot;&gt;Brain structural plasticity with spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Guardian - Neurophilosophy by Mo Constandi: How to become a super memorizer – and what it does to your brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;New research shows that we can train our brains to become memory champions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many of us, having to memorize a long list of items feels like a chore. But for others, it is more like a sport. Every year, hundreds of these ‘memory athletes’ compete with one another in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldmemorychampionships.com/&quot;&gt;World Memory Championships&lt;/a&gt;, memorising hundreds of words, numbers, or other pieces of information within minutes. The current world champion is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mullenmemory.com/&quot;&gt;Alex Mullen&lt;/a&gt;, who beat his competitors by memorizing a string of more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/lessons-from-americas-first-memory-world-champion&quot;&gt;550 digits in under 5 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think that such prodigious mental feats are linked to having an unusual brain, or to being extraordinarily clever. But they are not. New research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; shows that you, too, can be a super memorizer with just six weeks of intensive mnemonic training, and also reveals the long-lasting changes to brain structure and function that occur as a result of such training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/apr/24/the-homer-simpson-effect-forgetting-to-remember&quot;&gt;The Homer Simpson effect: forgetting to remember&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/mar/18/a-neural-pathway-that-erases-memories&quot;&gt;A neural pathway that erases memories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/mar/08/how-to-become-a-super-memorizer-and-what-it-does-to-your-brain&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

	<title>Brain Byte - The HBP blog: Why gender matters for the HBP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/a78626e135c1</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/why-gender-matters-for-the-hbp-a78626e135c1?source=rss----8bf7660fc7aa---4</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A blog post for International Women’s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Katharina Schiederig, EAF Berlin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been only 100 years that women were allowed to study at universities, e.g. in 1908 in Prussia/Germany. Around the same time, an annual International Women’s Day was introduced on March 8 to commemorate the struggle for women’s rights. A historic event only? The theme for International Women’s Day 2017 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internationalwomensday.com/BeBold&quot;&gt;#BeBoldForChange&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone is called upon to help forge a better working world — a more gender inclusive world. Does this matter for the Human Brain Project as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at the numbers, we can say: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst women were once under-represented at doctoral level, in 2012 they made up 47% of PhD graduates in the EU (EU-28), and between 40% and 60% of PhD graduates in all countries covered by the She Figures (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/she-figures-2015-pbKI0415386/&quot;&gt;EU Commission, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). In 2011, women in the EU accounted for only 33% of researchers. In decision-making positions, the share is lower, and this is also true for the HBP: only two of the 12 Subprojects are led by female researchers, and the Directorate has one woman out of 7 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why one of the main challenges will be to increase the number of women in higher positions, particularly in governing bodies and in education activities. The HBP aims to play a pioneering role in advancing gender equality by targeting a balanced share of male and female scientists in research teams and decision-making, as well as promoting awareness of gender equality in research and innovation. &lt;strong&gt;This is not only a question of fairness for all; research has also shown that diverse organizations achieve more creative results and attract a more diverse talent pool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the HBP will launch an online survey on gender issues among all HBP staff. The results will serve as a baseline to ensure that future policies can be aligned with needs and we can address the barriers identified. Both female and male scientists are invited to share their experiences and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, foundations will be laid for a comprehensive and sustainable gender strategy for the entire term of the HBP. The HBP is supported in this challenging task by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eaf-berlin.de/&quot;&gt;EAF Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, an independent, non-profit research and consulting organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further activities planned over the next 15 months include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· A good practice study and a database will collect innovative policies and existing measures from the collaborating partners and institutions in order to disseminate good practices and to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· In order to monitor gender equality activities and to transfer them into the entire HBP, a gender advisory committee, linked to the governing structures of the HBP, will be set up. A gender action plan with targets and milestones will be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Finally, a conference on gender perspectives will take place in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gender equality activities are coordinated by the Project Coordination Office in Geneva. We hope that both HBP researchers and those in the wider scientific community can be inspired by these activities and incorporate them into your personal initiatives around International Women’s Day 2017!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=a78626e135c1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/why-gender-matters-for-the-hbp-a78626e135c1&quot;&gt;Why gender matters for the HBP&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog&quot;&gt;Brain Byte Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Feeling authentic in a relationship – that is, feeling like you are able to be yourself, rather than acting out of character – is healthy, not just for the relationship, but for your wellbeing in general. This makes sense: after all, putting on a fake show can be exhausting. But dig a little deeper and things get more complicated because there are different ways to define who “you” really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the real you how you actually think and behave, for instance? Or, taking a more dynamic perspective, is it fairer to say that the true you is the person you aspire to be: what psychologists call your “ideal self”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216688211&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, Muping Gan and Serena Chen asked members of the public about this and 70 per cent of them thought that the ability to be your actual self was more important for feeling authentic in a relationship than being able to be your ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But contrary to this folk wisdom, across several studies, the researchers actually found evidence for the opposite – that is, feelings of authenticity in a relationship seem to arise not from being our actual selves in the relationship, but from feeling that we can be our best or ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20357&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers made this discovery across several surveys conducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website, each involving hundreds of participants of varying ages and in a range of different relationships, from the relatively new to decades-long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one survey, participants answered questions about how they acted in their relationship, described what they considered to be their actual self, their ideal self, and they also answered questions about their feelings of authenticity in that relationship (for instance, they rated how much they could “be themselves” when with their partner and how they much they “felt artificial”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that feelings of authenticity in the relationship were higher when the way they behaved in the relationship more closely matched what they considered to be their ideal self. This association stayed true even when factoring out the contribution of other more general relationship factors, like relationship satisfaction and commitment. In contrast, being able to act in the relationship in ways similar to how they’d described their actual self did not correlate with feelings of authenticity in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further surveys, the researchers asked participants to perform short thought experiments before measuring their feelings of relationship authenticity. For example, in one survey some participants spent time thinking about ways that they are able to act like their ideal selves in their relationship whereas other participants spent time thinking about the ways they act with their partner that are different from their ideal self. In another case, participants spent time thinking about how the way they act with their partner is the same as their actual self, while others thought about how they are unable to act like their actual selves when with their partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of these different thought experiments were clear: thinking about the ability to be one’s ideal self in the relationship increased subsequent feelings of relationship authenticity (and thinking of not be able to be one’s ideal self had the converse effect). Meanwhile, thinking about the ability to be one’s actual self in the relationship did not increase feelings of relationship authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, at least when it comes to feelings of authenticity in a relationship, what seems to matter the most is not that we can be ourselves, as such, but that we can behave as the kind of person we strive to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chimes in an interesting way with another concept in relationship research known as the Michelangelo phenomenon. This is the finding that we tend to make more progress towards our ideal selves when our partner has the same traits that we aspire to have ourselves, through encouragement or acting by example. The name of the concept invokes the idea of our partners helping to reveal our ideal selves, like a sculptor gradually reveals the form of a statue. These new findings suggest that if you have a partner like this, not only will you make more progress toward the kind of person you’d like to be, but that you’ll also have stronger feelings of authenticity in that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gan and Chen conclude their paper by suggesting that it might be time to revise the authenticity trope in romantic movies, such as when Mac in &lt;em&gt;Juno&lt;/em&gt; says: “Look, in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you…”. Perhaps in the future, the researchers write, “a movie character will dispense advice more along the lines of: “Look, in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who you feel like you are your ‘best you’ with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216688211&quot;&gt;Being Your Actual or Ideal Self? What It Means to Feel Authentic in a Relationship &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;© kbuntu / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Fotolia-Person-holding-a-globe-kbuntu-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internationalwomensday.com/&quot;&gt;International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt; is a time where changes which are needed to ensure gender equality are highlighted to increase awareness about the inequities present as well as celebrating the achievements of women who have overcome barriers. One of the action points listed for the #BeBoldForChange, is that which tackles violence against women. Gender based violence is often divided into two categories which are interlinked: Interpersonal and Structural/ Institutional. Broadly speaking, interpersonal violence refers to an act of violence such as physical, psychological and sexual violence perpetrated by an individual (i.e. partner or non-partner) against another. It is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&quot;&gt;35% of women worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lifetime. It has also been found that globally, around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&quot;&gt;38% of women murdered&lt;/a&gt; were at the hands of a male intimate partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8653&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;© Tiko / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8653&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Fotolia-Female-hand-stop-sign-Tiko-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© Tiko / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural/ institutional violence refers to systematic ways in which social structures harm or otherwise puts individuals at a disadvantage. It is the violence of injustice and inequity. These structures are violent because they result in avoidable deaths, illness and injury. By being built into the fabric of society (i.e. political and economic organization of our social world) it &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-015-0256-4&quot;&gt;creates and maintains inequalities&lt;/a&gt; within and between different social groups, and also among ethnic-cultural or other minority groups. Structural violence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438698&quot;&gt;creates barriers&lt;/a&gt; and prevents people from accessing the resources needed to develop their full human potential and also threatens the achievement of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/&quot;&gt;Millennium Development Goals (MDG)&lt;/a&gt; which are a set of targets for improving the lives of the world’s poorest people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Violence against women is a significant public health issue and a violation of human rights. It can have negative impacts on a woman’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health. It has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85241/1/WHO_RHR_HRP_13.06_eng.pdf?ua=1&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that women who have been physically or sexually abused by their partners are 16% more likely to have a low birth weight baby, more than twice as likely to have an abortion, 1.5 times more prone to acquire HIV, and almost twice as likely to experience depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen&quot;&gt;Thematic Series: The Role of Structural and Interpersonal Violence in the Lives of Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cross-journal thematic series running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The aim of the article collection is to build a strong understanding of structural and interpersonal violence against women, to explore its prevalence, incidence and possible risk factors as well as to identify policy responses to address structural inequities that make women vulnerable to various forms of violence. There is a clear need to increase efforts across a range of domains to tackle and prevent violence from taking place and to provide the necessary support and service for those who have fallen victim to these circumstances. Through research, acquisition of data and information, decision making and policy can be informed to address, reduce and ultimately end violence against women. After all, equality and a life free of violence are basic human rights that belong to every person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article collection is currently open for submission. Published papers which form part of the collection can be accessed via its homepage (please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Molecular biology: A hidden competitive advantage of disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21893</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/LI9L8bm6ah4/nature21893</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cellular response to low oxygen levels is regulated by a process in which one protein is ousted from a binding site by another. It emerges that protein disorder allows the displacement to occur remarkably efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21893&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21893&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/LI9L8bm6ah4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Hypersensitive termination of the hypoxic response by a disordered protein switch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21705</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/exTwN0GsxCc/nature21705</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The cellular response to hypoxia is critical for cell survival and is fine-tuned to allow cells to recover from hypoxic stress and adapt to heterogeneous or fluctuating oxygen levels. The hypoxic response is mediated by the α-subunit of the transcription factor HIF-1 (HIF-1α), which interacts through its intrinsically disordered C-terminal transactivation domain with the TAZ1 (also known as CH1) domain of the general transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 to control the transcription of critical adaptive genes. One such gene encodes CITED2, a negative feedback regulator that attenuates HIF-1 transcriptional activity by competing for TAZ1 binding through its own disordered transactivation domain. Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which CITED2 displaces the tightly bound HIF-1α from their common cellular target. The HIF-1α and CITED2 transactivation domains bind to TAZ1 through helical motifs that flank a conserved LP(Q/E)L sequence that is essential for negative feedback regulation. Here we show that human CITED2 displaces HIF-1α by forming a transient ternary complex with TAZ1 and HIF-1α and competing for a shared binding site through its LPEL motif, thus promoting a conformational change in TAZ1 that increases the rate of HIF-1α dissociation. Through allosteric enhancement of HIF-1α release, CITED2 activates a highly responsive negative feedback circuit that rapidly and efficiently attenuates the hypoxic response, even at modest CITED2 concentrations. This hypersensitive regulatory switch is entirely dependent on the unique flexibility and binding properties of these intrinsically disordered proteins and probably exemplifies a common strategy used by the cell to respond rapidly to environmental signals.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: MC4R-dependent suppression of appetite by bone-derived lipocalin 2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21697</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/iaEgP83CNzQ/nature21697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Bone has recently emerged as a pleiotropic endocrine organ that secretes at least two hormones, FGF23 and osteocalcin, which regulate kidney function and glucose homeostasis, respectively. These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood–brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine function of bone.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Nomadic ecology shaped the highland geography of Asia’s Silk Roads</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21696</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 There are many unanswered questions about the evolution of the ancient ‘Silk Roads’ across Asia. This is especially the case in their mountainous stretches, where harsh terrain is seen as an impediment to travel. Considering the ecology and mobility of inner Asian mountain pastoralists, we use ‘flow accumulation’ modelling to calculate the annual routes of nomadic societies (from 750 m to 4,000 m elevation). Aggregating 500 iterations of the model reveals a high-resolution flow network that simulates how centuries of seasonal nomadic herding could shape discrete routes of connectivity across the mountains of Asia. We then compare the locations of known high-elevation Silk Road sites with the geography of these optimized herding flows, and find a significant correspondence in mountainous regions. Thus, we argue that highland Silk Road networks (from 750 m to 4,000 m) emerged slowly in relation to long-established mobility patterns of nomadic herders in the mountains of inner Asia.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: KRAB zinc-finger proteins contribute to the evolution of gene regulatory networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21683</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Z6ck1yp_Rpg/nature21683</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human genome encodes some 350 Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing zinc-finger proteins (KZFPs), the products of a rapidly evolving gene family that has been traced back to early tetrapods. The function of most KZFPs is unknown, but a few have been demonstrated to repress transposable elements in embryonic stem (ES) cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator TRIM28 and associated mediators of histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)-dependent heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation. Depletion of TRIM28 in human or mouse ES cells triggers the upregulation of a broad range of transposable elements, and recent data based on a few specific examples have pointed to an arms race between hosts and transposable elements as an important driver of KZFP gene selection. Here, to obtain a global view of this phenomenon, we combined phylogenetic and genomic studies to investigate the evolutionary emergence of KZFP genes in vertebrates and to identify their targets in the human genome. First, we unexpectedly reassigned the root of the family to a common ancestor of coelacanths and tetrapods. Second, although we confirmed that the majority of KZFPs bind transposable elements and pinpoint cases of ongoing co-evolution, we found that most of their transposable element targets have lost all transposition potential. Third, by examining the interplay between human KZFPs and other transcriptional modulators, we obtained evidence that KZFPs exploit evolutionarily conserved fragments of transposable elements as regulatory platforms long after the arms race against these genetic invaders has ended. Together, our results demonstrate that KZFPs partner with transposable elements to build a largely species-restricted layer of epigenetic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21683&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21683&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Z6ck1yp_Rpg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Neanderthal behaviour, diet, and disease inferred from ancient DNA in dental calculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21674</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/xy8Yv4sm-jI/nature21674</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Recent genomic data have revealed multiple interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans, but there is currently little genetic evidence regarding Neanderthal behaviour, diet, or disease. Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque (calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from El Sidrón cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss reflected forest gathering. Differences in diet were also linked to an overall shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota. Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidrón Neanderthal with a dental abscess and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2× depth of coverage)—the oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Interplay between metabolic identities in the intestinal crypt supports stem cell function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21673</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The small intestinal epithelium self-renews every four or five days. Intestinal stem cells (Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells (CBCs)) sustain this renewal and reside between terminally differentiated Paneth cells at the bottom of the intestinal crypt. Whereas the signalling requirements for maintaining stem cell function and crypt homeostasis have been well studied, little is known about how metabolism contributes to epithelial homeostasis. Here we show that freshly isolated Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells from the mouse small intestine display different metabolic programs. Compared to Paneth cells, Lgr5+ CBCs display high mitochondrial activity. Inhibition of mitochondrial activity in Lgr5+ CBCs or inhibition of glycolysis in Paneth cells strongly affects stem cell function, as indicated by impaired organoid formation. In addition, Paneth cells support stem cell function by providing lactate to sustain the enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the Lgr5+ CBCs. Mechanistically, we show that oxidative phosphorylation stimulates p38 MAPK activation by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species signalling, thereby establishing the mature crypt phenotype. Together, our results reveal a critical role for the metabolic identity of Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells in supporting optimal stem cell function, and we identify mitochondria and reactive oxygen species signalling as a driving force of cellular differentiation.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Aboriginal mitogenomes reveal 50,000 years of regionalism in Australia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Aboriginal Australians represent one of the longest continuous cultural complexes known. Archaeological evidence indicates that Australia and New Guinea were initially settled approximately 50 thousand years ago (ka); however, little is known about the processes underlying the enormous linguistic and phenotypic diversity within Australia. Here we report 111 mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from historical Aboriginal Australian hair samples, whose origins enable us to reconstruct Australian phylogeographic history before European settlement. Marked geographic patterns and deep splits across the major mitochondrial haplogroups imply that the settlement of Australia comprised a single, rapid migration along the east and west coasts that reached southern Australia by 49–45 ka. After continent-wide colonization, strong regional patterns developed and these have survived despite substantial climatic and cultural change during the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Remarkably, we find evidence for the continuous presence of populations in discrete geographic areas dating back to around 50 ka, in agreement with the notable Aboriginal Australian cultural attachment to their country.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Complex multi-enhancer contacts captured by genome architecture mapping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21411</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The organization of the genome in the nucleus and the interactions of genes with their regulatory elements are key features of transcriptional control and their disruption can cause disease. Here we report a genome-wide method, genome architecture mapping (GAM), for measuring chromatin contacts and other features of three-dimensional chromatin topology on the basis of sequencing DNA from a large collection of thin nuclear sections. We apply GAM to mouse embryonic stem cells and identify enrichment for specific interactions between active genes and enhancers across very large genomic distances using a mathematical model termed SLICE (statistical inference of co-segregation). GAM also reveals an abundance of three-way contacts across the genome, especially between regions that are highly transcribed or contain super-enhancers, providing a level of insight into genome architecture that, owing to the technical limitations of current technologies, has previously remained unattainable. Furthermore, GAM highlights a role for gene-expression-specific contacts in organizing the genome in mammalian nuclei.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Class IIa HDAC inhibition reduces breast tumours and metastases through anti-tumour macrophages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21409</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Although the main focus of immuno-oncology has been manipulating the adaptive immune system, harnessing both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system might produce superior tumour reduction and elimination. Tumour-associated macrophages often have net pro-tumour effects, but their embedded location and their untapped potential provide impetus to discover strategies to turn them against tumours. Strategies that deplete (anti-CSF-1 antibodies and CSF-1R inhibition) or stimulate (agonistic anti-CD40 or inhibitory anti-CD47 antibodies) tumour-associated macrophages have had some success. We hypothesized that pharmacologic modulation of macrophage phenotype could produce an anti-tumour effect. We previously reported that a first-in-class selective class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, TMP195, influenced human monocyte responses to the colony-stimulating factors CSF-1 and CSF-2 in vitro. Here, we utilize a macrophage-dependent autochthonous mouse model of breast cancer to demonstrate that in vivo TMP195 treatment alters the tumour microenvironment and reduces tumour burden and pulmonary metastases by modulating macrophage phenotypes. TMP195 induces the recruitment and differentiation of highly phagocytic and stimulatory macrophages within tumours. Furthermore, combining TMP195 with chemotherapy regimens or T-cell checkpoint blockade in this model significantly enhances the durability of tumour reduction. These data introduce class IIa HDAC inhibition as a means to harness the anti-tumour potential of macrophages to enhance cancer therapy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It emerges that nascent non-coding RNAs transcribed from regulatory DNA sequences called enhancers bind to the enzyme CBP to promote its activity locally.

&lt;p&gt;Adolescents take more risks than adults: they are more likely to binge drink, have casual sex, commit crimes and have serious car accidents. In fact, adolescence is a paradox because it is a time of peak physical fitness, but also the time when people are most likely to be injured or killed in an accident. For this reason, it’s critical to understand what drives teenagers to take more risks. To date, many explanations of teenage risk taking have focused on the positive side of these behaviours: the rewarding “kick” that comes from taking a risk that ends well. Some studies have shown that teenagers experience more of this rewarding feeling, and this contributes to the increased risk taking seen at this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer studies have considered how teenagers respond when risks turn out badly. This is important because all our previous experiences, both good and bad, affect our subsequent behaviour. If we make a risky decision like gambling money, and it pays off, it’s more likely we’ll decide to gamble again in the near future. Equally, if we take a gamble and it turns out badly, we’ll probably be a bit more reserved next time. But it turns out that some teenagers don’t respond like this: according to a new study in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, some of them do not adjust their behavior so readily when things go wrong, and this may be linked to a distinct pattern of activation in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20339&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan McCormick and Eva Telzer at North Carolina University asked 58 adolescents (aged 13 to 17) to play a game that involved risks. The researchers scanned the participants’ brains while they played, and also monitored how losing the game in one round (taking a risk that didn’t pay off) affected their behaviour in the subsequent round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game involved blowing up 24 virtual balloons shown on a computer screen. Each balloon started small, and the more that participants pumped it up (by pressing a keyboard key), the more points they earned. However, there was a catch: as the balloon got bigger, there was always a chance that it would pop, causing a loud explosion on the screen and losing the participant all the points they had obtained on that round. So the teenagers had to make a series of risky decisions: should they cash out and save the points they had accumulated so far, or risk the balloon popping for the chance of even more points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the outcome from one balloon affected the teens’ behaviour on the next one. After an explosion outcome (a risk that turned out badly), they tended to pump fewer times on the subsequent balloon before cashing out. Conversely, when they successfully cashed out the points before the balloon popped, the teens tended to risk more pumps the next time round. Importantly, though, this wasn’t the same for all of them: some of the teenagers continued to pump a lot even after their last balloon had just exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick and Telzer found that this behaviour was linked to a distinctive pattern of neural activation. Specifically, teens who were less sensitive to past explosions (i.e. less likely to change their behaviour on subsequent rounds) had reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved in decision making processes, like judging how risky we think a decision is, and how good we consider the result. These same teens also said they engaged in more real-life risk-taking, like drinking alcohol or taking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current findings suggest that – for some teenagers at least – it’s not just about remembering the good times, it’s about forgetting the bad times, too: some teenagers are not using past outcomes to change their current behavior. It’s not clear from the brain activity differences whether this is a conscious decision, or whether this insensitivity to the past is happening outside of the person’s awareness. It’s also important to note that the study focused on teenagers only, and didn’t include a group of children or adults, so we don’t know whether the findings reported here are unique to this age group, or common to big risk-takers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we use this information to reduce risk taking in teenagers? Might it be beneficial to encourage those who take risks to consider their past behavior, to remember when things turned out badly, and suggest they use this to guide their behaviour? From the present data, it’s not clear whether this is a skill that could be taught. It’s also important to consider just how much we want to reduce risk taking. Adolescence is a time of potential vulnerability, and we need to educate young people to protect them from harming themselves. But risk taking is not inherently bad. Within limits, taking risks allows us to become independent and to learn about the world around us. It’s a fundamental part of growing up. We need to walk the fine line between encouraging our young people to stay safe, whilst also allowing them to navigate the world for themselves – even when this means taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of patents implicating specific brain regions has risen from 1976 to the mid 2010s. Results were obtained by searching The Lens patent database (http://lens.org/).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“What is the ethical value of awarding patent rights that implicate regions of the brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the applicants intend to patent the function of specific brain areas? This absurd scenario was the first thing that came to mind. The murky waters of neurotech patent law were explored by a group of neuroethics and intellectual property experts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3782&quot;&gt;Roskams-Edriset al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) who noted several problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The first practical challenge to patents that relate to brain regions is  well known to patent law: the danger of overbroad, vague, or obvious claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One egregious example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9327069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US 9327069 B2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Methods and systems for treating a medical condition by promoting neural remodeling within the brain&lt;/i&gt;. The language is extremely vague (and redundant):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Methods of treating a medical condition include applying at least one stimulus to a stimulation site within the brain of a patient with an implanted stimulator in accordance with one or more stimulation parameters. The [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;]  at least one stimulus is configured to promote neural remodeling within the brain of the patient. Systems for treating a medical condition include an implantable stimulator configured to apply at least one stimulus to a stimulation site within the brain of a patient in accordance with one or more stimulation parameters...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of stimulus will “promote neural remodeling?” All of them. As stated in the Detailed Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The stimulus may include an electrical stimulation current, one or more drugs, gene infusion, chemical stimulation, thermal stimulation, electromagnetic stimulation, mechanical stimulation, and/or any other suitable stimulus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brain conditions can be treated? All of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Many medical conditions have been linked to faulty neural connections and/or abnormal developmental pruning of axons, dendrites, and synapses within the brain. Such medical conditions include, but are not limited to, autism, psychological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, compulsive behaviors, and depression), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, what are the implicated brain regions? You guessed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nearly every brain area has been implicated in the disorders listed above.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In particular, it is believed that faulty neural connections and/or abnormal developmental pruning of neural structures within the temporal lobe, limbic system, pituitary gland, brainstem, cerebral cortex, and/or any other midbrain structure are at least in part responsible for the deficits of one or more of the disorders listed above.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9327069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claims&lt;/a&gt; that apply in this patent (e.g., stimulation sites and medical conditions) are slightly more specific, but still outlandish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;4. ... said stimulation site comprises at least one or more of a  temporal lobe, cerebral ventricle, structure within a limbic system,  pituitary gland, brainstem, and cerebral cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. ...said medical condition comprises at least one or more of  autism, a psychological disorder, a neurodegenerative disease, a  chromosomal abnormality, a bad habit, and an injury to said brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A bad habit??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;100,000,000 Hz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better is Patent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9050463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US 9,050,463&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Systems and methods for stimulating cellular function in tissue&lt;/i&gt;), which touts the application of electrical fields with frequencies of 100,000,000 Hz and above to the entire nervous system...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;....various structures within the brain or nervous system including but not limited to dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, any component of the basal ganglia, nucleus accumbens, gastric nuclei, brainstem, thalamus, inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, primary motor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, occipital lobe, Brodmann areas 1-48, primary sensory cortex, primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, cochlea, cranial nerves, cerebellum, frontal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, sub-cortical structures, spinal cord, nerve roots, sensory organs, and peripheral nerves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ...to treat all known diseases:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Such pathologies that may be treated include but are not limited to Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, Dystonia, Tics, Spinal Cord Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury, Drug Craving, Food Craving, Alcohol Craving, Nicotine Craving, Stuttering, Tinnitus, Spasticity, Parkinson's Disease, Parkinsonianism, Obsessions, Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Acute Mania, Catonia, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Autism, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Phantom Limb Pain, Epilepsy, Stroke, Auditory Hallucinations, Movement Disorders, Neurodegenerative Disorders, Pain Disorders, Metabolic Disorders, Addictive Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders, Traumatic Nerve Injury, and Sensory Disorders. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-mG68AVIFM/WL09k-_RhGI/AAAAAAAAMEE/iHbki5UyfNAtkNIfTkjO_EYwx2t82KJhQCLcB/s1600/US%2B8594783%2BB..png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-mG68AVIFM/WL09k-_RhGI/AAAAAAAAMEE/iHbki5UyfNAtkNIfTkjO_EYwx2t82KJhQCLcB/s320/US%2B8594783%2BB..png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, the specific &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9050463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claims&lt;/a&gt; in this patent include an indication limited to Parkinson's disease.

	<title>Retraction watch: Two retracted papers were published behind bosses’ backs</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know” Ernest Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us would like to be smarter and happier, but does one lead to the other? Folk wisdom suggests not: old sayings tell us that “ignorance is bliss” and that “only a fool can be happy”. What does the psychology literature say? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879117300039&quot;&gt;new meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Vocational Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; has combined the results from dozens of previous studies involving many tens of thousands of participants and, contrary to the received wisdom, it concludes that higher intelligence actually does correlate with greater happiness (or “life satisfaction”) and job satisfaction, but only weakly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20262&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Gonzalez-Mulé at Indiana University and his colleagues sifted the literature, identifying relevant papers, published and unpublished, going back to 1980. Combining the results from 33 papers involving nearly 50,000 participants, they found that intelligence (or what they called “general mental ability”) had a weak but statistically non-significant positive correlation with life satisfaction, and a modest, statistically significant positive correlation with job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found further evidence for the apparent benefits of higher intelligence for life satisfaction by factoring in the influence of “job complexity” (greater complexity meaning a job with more variety, skill demands and autonomy) and job income, two factors that are themselves correlated with greater happiness. This showed that higher intelligence has indirect links with greater happiness because more intelligent people tend to earn more, but especially because they tend to have more complex jobs, which presumably are more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 38 studies involving nearly 30,000 participants, higher intelligence also had indirect links with job satisfaction by virtue of the fact that it correlated with job complexity and income. But this is psychology, so of course there’s a twist that somewhat supports the folk wisdom about intelligent people rarely being happy. When the researchers held job complexity and income constant in their analysis, they found that higher intelligence actually correlated with less job satisfaction. Put differently, if you imagine a range of people at a given level of job complexity and income, those with higher intelligence will tend to be less happy with their jobs. This makes intuitive sense if you consider that smarter people will be more likely than others to experience boredom and frustration at jobs that are not challenging enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great strength of meta-analyses like this one is in the huge amounts of data that they can draw on. But the new study also has some obvious limitations: some of the data is decades-old and may not be relevant to today’s world. Also, this is cross-sectional data which can’t convincingly address whether intelligence is causing changes in life and job satisfaction, nor how such processes may unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879117300039&quot;&gt;Are smarter people happier? Meta-analyses of the relationships between general mental ability and job and life satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Paleoproterozoic sterol biosynthesis and the rise of oxygen</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21412</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/q-goyaWUDe0/nature21412</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Natural products preserved in the geological record can function as ‘molecular fossils’, providing insight into organisms and physiologies that existed in the deep past. One important group of molecular fossils is the steroidal hydrocarbons (steranes), which are the diagenetic remains of sterol lipids. Complex sterols with modified side chains are unique to eukaryotes, although simpler sterols can also be synthesized by a few bacteria. Sterol biosynthesis is an oxygen-intensive process; thus, the presence of complex steranes in ancient rocks not only signals the presence of eukaryotes, but also aerobic metabolic processes. In 1999, steranes were reported in 2.7 billion year (Gyr)-old rocks from the Pilbara Craton in Australia, suggesting a long delay between photosynthetic oxygen production and its accumulation in the atmosphere (also known as the Great Oxidation Event) 2.45–2.32 Gyr ago. However, the recent reappraisal and rejection of these steranes as contaminants pushes the oldest reported steranes forward to around 1.64 Gyr ago (ref. 6). Here we use a molecular clock approach to improve constraints on the evolution of sterol biosynthesis. We infer that stem eukaryotes shared functionally modern sterol biosynthesis genes with bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. Comparing multiple molecular clock analyses, we find that the maximum marginal probability for the divergence time of bacterial and eukaryal sterol biosynthesis genes is around 2.31 Gyr ago, concurrent with the most recent geochemical evidence for the Great Oxidation Event. Our results therefore indicate that simple sterol biosynthesis existed well before the diversification of living eukaryotes, substantially predating the oldest detected sterane biomarkers (approximately 1.64 Gyr ago), and furthermore, that the evolutionary history of sterol biosynthesis is tied to the first widespread availability of molecular oxygen in the ocean–atmosphere system.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Molecular basis of ancestral vertebrate electroreception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21401</guid>

 Elasmobranch fishes, including sharks, rays, and skates, use specialized electrosensory organs called ampullae of Lorenzini to detect extremely small changes in environmental electric fields. Electrosensory cells within these ampullae can discriminate and respond to minute changes in environmental voltage gradients through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.3 and the big conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel are preferentially expressed by electrosensory cells in little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) and functionally couple to mediate electrosensory cell membrane voltage oscillations, which are important for the detection of specific, weak electrical signals. Both channels exhibit unique properties compared with their mammalian orthologues that support electrosensory functions: structural adaptations in CaV1.3 mediate a low-voltage threshold for activation, and alterations in BK support specifically tuned voltage oscillations. These findings reveal a molecular basis of electroreception and demonstrate how discrete evolutionary changes in ion channel structure facilitate sensory adaptation.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Channels-Blog-image&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/Channels-Blog-image-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At PLOS, we aim to support academic communities in communicating their research in open and accessible ways. The first of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a new way for specialist communities to communicate, find and read research content, launch this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels provide an innovative way of curating and presenting published research relevant to a scholarly community. Each is curated by a small group of Channel Editors, themselves researchers, who continuously bring together and showcase recently published research content selected from the broad scope of PLOS journals. Importantly, Channel Editors can point to resources, news and commentary from many online sources, including articles published in other journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS developed Channels for communities to drive according to their own content priorities, without limitation to any particular journal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With experts at the helm, and content selected by researchers for researchers, we hope to create online venues that become a preferred destination for research communities. To this end, the Channels concept was designed with researchers’ input to adapt to various needs. Channels can be adopted as a resource by researchers in a specialist area, or bring together researchers from different academic backgrounds working towards a common aim. The first three Channels to launch illustrate a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VDRR&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-7396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/VDRR-1-300x229.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veteran Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born from a collaboration with the US Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, as a new home for the community previously served by the Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp;amp; Development (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jrrd/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JRRD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) which ceased publication in 2017. The new Channel, with an expanded international focus, features multidisciplinary research for a global community of researchers and care providers working with veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OST&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-7400 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/OST-300x209.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Toolkit Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showcases research from a diverse group of fields that have in common the description of innovative open source software and hardware applications that can be used in research and education. This Channel aims not to serve a specific scientific discipline but to create bridges between vibrant communities that build tools to support democratization and reproducibility of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tuberculosis Channel&lt;/strong&gt;, led by Academic Editors from &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, will launch on World TB Day, March 24th, 2017. This Channel will draw from PLOS journal content covering all aspects of TB from mycobacteriology to computational epidemiologic models, clinical diagnosis and treatment. By integrating these reports with content from a variety of external sources, Channel Editors aim to provide an accessible resource of interest to TB researchers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are grateful to the Channel Editors who have stepped up enthusiastically to pioneer the use of this new tool for their communities. More PLOS Channels will follow later this year—some are already in preparation. If you have interest in becoming a Channel Editor or see an unmet need in your community for this tool, we welcome your thoughts. We look forward to working with many more communities to help disseminate their work, create useful resources and foster collaboration within and across specialist communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barnes and her team discovered that most people found service provision confusing and difficult to access. In addition, benefit sanctions and preexisting mental health problems played a large role and many had the expectation that they should be self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study concludes that interventions are required to identify those in need so that they have guidance and access to practical and reliable advice. Listen to more in this podcast:&lt;/p&gt;
