	<description>Climate change, extreme weather events and debates over climate mitigation strategies dominated the news for much of the last year. Yet climate scientists continually wrestle with how best to talk about these issues: Should discussions of climate change appeal directly to people’s emotions, whether fear or anger or even hope? Or are data-driven discussions the way to go?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; Eleanor Morgan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy help people better control their emotions by teaching them new ways of thinking. A recent study &lt;a href=&quot;https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1053811918319402?token=7AF5F08BD5EBD1486AED3C46201760EB92F15996CE747ECFA6956B735F4C81F236B603BD0E96671637701A06BCC52B75&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests this approach could be augmented by using “neurofeedback” to help regulate activity in a key brain structure – the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36227&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a neural level, healthy regulation of our emotions involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.155&quot;&gt;the prefrontal cortex “down-regulating” activity in other brain areas, including the amygdala&lt;/a&gt;. This small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons, located on each side of the brain, is involved in memory processing, decision-making and emotional responses. Problems like PTSD, generalised anxiety and panic disorder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882379/&quot;&gt;are associated&lt;/a&gt; with heightened amygdala activation, raising the possibility that targeting this heightened activation could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Germany, Switzerland and the USA joined forces to investigate whether down-regulation of the amygdala could be increased through providing participants with feedback on their amygdala activity while they tried to regulate their emotions in a fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain scanner.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uwe Herwig and his team placed 15 participants with good mental health in a “Feedback” group and 11 in a “Control” group. All participants underwent four weekly real-time (rt)fMRI emotional training sessions that involved looking at a sequence of negative emotional images (to provoke amygdala activation) and trying to regulate their emotional reaction using a “reality check” reappraisal strategy. Only participants in the feedback group received visual feedback on their amygdala activity while they looked at the pictures and attempted to regulate their emotions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality-checking strategy involved using phrases such as “these are only pictures”, “I am participating in an experiment” and “I am lying in the scanner” (a form of cognitive reappraisal). Alongside this strategy, participants in the feedback group were also provided with visual feedback in the form of changing coloured squares that corresponded with their amygdala activation. In the control group, these colour squares changed randomly and the control participants were told they were meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they performed the “reality check” emotional regulation technique in the fourth week, the feedback group showed significantly decreased amygdala activation as compared to the first week. In contrast, no such down-regulation of amygdala activity was observed in the control group even though they used the same “reality check” exercise.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback group also exhibited increased task-related communication between the amygdala and other brain areas involved in emotional control. However, on the downside, the feedback group did not show greater down-regulation of their amygdala activity in a later, different task in which they were not given feedback and which involved them looking at videos of faces with negative expressions (the researchers speculated that this may have been due to the participants being fatigued and less motivated by this time).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, although the sample sizes were small, the study suggests that amygdala regulation &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be trained by neurofeedback, apparently augmenting the neural effects of a popular emotional regulation technique (though note the behavioral and emotional benefits of this remain unclear at present – the feedback and control groups did not differ in the emotions they said they felt during the experiment, nor in how successful they believed they had been at regulating their emotions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports existing research showing promise for the application of rt-fMRI neurofeedback in the treatment of problems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24244&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, addiction and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088785&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; that are associated with heightened amygdala activation. The clinical potential of this technique, bridging the worlds of neurobiology and psychotherapy, is clear. That said, fMRI scanning is an expensive business, so it may be a while before a new world of personalised mental health interventions reveals itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918319402&quot;&gt;Training emotion regulation through real-time fMRI neurofeedback of amygdala activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Neurocritic: Is executive function different from cognitive control? The results of an informal poll</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;It ended in a tie!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Is executive function different from cognitive control?&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1090532517843591168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this is a small and biased sample, and I don't have a large number of followers. The answers might have been different had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/russpoldrack&quot;&gt;@russpoldrack&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; in a landslide) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Neuro_Skeptic&quot;&gt;@Neuro_Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; (n=12,458 plus 598 wacky write-in votes) posed the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the poll I facetiously asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Other hypothetical questions (that you don't need to answer) might include&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you a clinical neuropsychologist? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you use computational modeling in your work?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your age? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here, I was thinking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clinical neuropsychologists would say &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computational researchers would say &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, older people would be more likely to say &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; than younger people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the poll I asked, “So what ARE the differences between executive function and cognitive  control? Or are the terms arbitrary, and their usage a matter of context  / subfield?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wanted to expound on the differences between the terms.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I answered &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;, because I think the terms are arbitrary, and their usage a matter of context and subfield. Not that Wikipedia is the ultimate authority, but I was amused to see this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; id=&quot;siteSub&quot;&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;contentSub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-redirectedfrom&quot;&gt;  (Redirected from &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cognitive_control&amp;amp;redirect=no&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive control&quot;&gt;Cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-redirectedfrom&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Executive functions&lt;/b&gt; (collectively referred to as &lt;b&gt;executive function&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;cognitive control&lt;/b&gt;) are a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition&quot; title=&quot;Cognition&quot;&gt;cognitive processes&lt;/a&gt; that are necessary for the cognitive control of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot; title=&quot;Behavior&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt;:  selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the  attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive  processes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control&quot; title=&quot;Attentional control&quot;&gt;attentional control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_inhibition&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive inhibition&quot;&gt;cognitive inhibition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_control&quot; title=&quot;Inhibitory control&quot;&gt;inhibitory control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory&quot; title=&quot;Working memory&quot;&gt;working memory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_flexibility&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive flexibility&quot;&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/cognitive-control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Cognitive  control is the process by which goals or plans influence behaviour. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also called executive control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, this process can inhibit automatic  responses and influence working memory. Cognitive control supports  flexible, adaptive responses and complex goal-directed thought. Some  disorders, such as schizophrenia and ADHD, are associated with  impairments of &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;executive function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're using the terms interchangeably! The terms cognitive control, executive control, executive function, and executive control functions are not well-differentiated, except in specific contexts. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/people/carter.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Cameron Carter&quot;&gt;Carter Lab&lt;/a&gt; definition below sounds specific at first, but then branches out to encompass many “executive functions” not named as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/research/control.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognitive Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;Cognitive control&quot; is a construct from contemporary cognitive  neuroscience that refers to processes that allow information processing  and behavior to vary adaptively from moment to moment depending on  current goals, rather than remaining rigid and inflexible.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Cognitive  control processes include a broad class of mental operations including  goal or context representation and maintenance, and strategic processes  such as attention allocation and stimulus-response mapping. Cognitive  control is associated with a wide range of processes and is not  restricted to a particular cognitive domain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For example, the presence  of impairments in cognitive control functions may be associated with  specific deficits in attention, memory, language comprehension and  emotional processing. ...  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the term &lt;i&gt;Cognitive Control &lt;/i&gt;dates back to the 1920s, if not further. Two quick examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; When talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and 'g' fame&quot;&gt;Charles Spearman&lt;/a&gt; and his theory of intelligence and his three qualitative principles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.ovid.com/educational-psychology/jedup/1928/01/000/mental-testing-pragmatic-theory/1/00004760&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles S. Slocombe (1928)&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“To  these  he  adds  five  quantitative  principles,  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cognitive  control (attention)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, fatigue,  retentivity,  constancy of output, and primordial potency...”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Simple! Cognitive Control = Attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2017516&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frederick Anderson (1942)&lt;/a&gt;, in The Relational Theory of Mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Meanings, then, are mental processes which, although not themselves objects for consciousness, actively modify and characterize that of which we are for the moment conscious. They differ from other subconscious processes in this respect, that we have &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;cognitive control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; over them and can at any moment bring them to light if  we choose.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cognitive Control = having the capacity of “bringing things into consciousness” — is this different from attention, or “paying attention” to something by making it the focus of awareness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving into the 21st century, two of the quintessential contemporary cognitive control papers that [mostly] banish executives from their midst are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11283309&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miller and Cohen (2001)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“The prefrontal cortex has long been suspected to play an important role in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cognitive control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in the ability to orchestrate thought and action in accordance with internal goals.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488380&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Botvinick et al. (2001)&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“A remarkable feature of the human cognitive system is its ability to configure itself for the performance of specific tasks through appropriate adjustments in perceptual selection, response biasing, and the on-line maintenance of contextual information. The processes behind such adaptability, referred to collectively as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;cognitive control&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have been the focus of a growing research program within cognitive psychology.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally approached this topic during research for a future post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindstronghealth.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'a healthcare innovation company transforming brain health through pioneering work in measurement science and new models of care delivery'&quot;&gt;Mindstrong&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“digital phenotyping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;” technology.&lt;/span&gt; Two of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindstronghealth.com/about-the-biomarkers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are Executive Function and Cognitive Control. How do they differ?

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last week, we've continued to make progress on packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662526&quot;&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt; review should be done in a few days. We can then begin on the
MPI versions, and Python bindings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/190&quot;&gt;arbor&lt;/a&gt; is still a WIP. Here's a pre-print the developers published recently
announcing it: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version 1 of the Brian Simulator is now available in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/copr/&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora extras
COPR repository&lt;/a&gt;. This version is in maintenance mode only and users should
prefer the new &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-brian2&quot;&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt; simulator for their work. We only make version 1
available because &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN/pull/617&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; currently does not support version 2---that is a work
in progress. Version 1 of the simulator will not be provided for Fedora
releases after 29 since Fedora 30+ &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Mass_Python_2_Package_Removal&quot;&gt;are moving to Python3 only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A new paper offers a broad challenge to a certain kind of 'grand theory' about the brain. According to the authors, Federico E. Turkheimer and colleagues, it is problematic to build models of brain function that rely on 'strong emergence'.



Two popular theories, the Free Energy Principle aka Bayesian Brain and the Integrated Information Theory model, are singled out as examples of strong emergence-based work.



Emergence refers to the idea that a system can exhibit behavior or propert</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: Format text on your Storefront with Markdown</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2104</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-format-text-on-your-storefront-with-markdown/</link>
	<description>&lt;header class=&quot;article-header clearfix&quot;&gt;Science Exchange supports a syntax called Markdown that allows you to format your Storefront and Service descriptions. You can add headers, lists, bold or italicize text, add links and more, which can help when  your Lab Summary or Service Descriptions are heavy with content.&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of frequently used Markdown shortcuts are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hashtags, you can delineate a line of text as a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# This is a level 1 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## This is a level 2 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### This is a level 3 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding text with an underscore will italicize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_I like rocket science_ becomes &lt;em&gt;I like rocket science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding text with double asterisks will bold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**I like rocket science**  becomes &lt;strong&gt;I like rocket science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: How can reviews and endorsements boost my rankings?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2103</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-how-can-reviews-and-endorsements-boost-my-rankings/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Search rankings are boosted by the number of orders completed, % positive reviews &amp;amp; ratings, as well as endorsements. Whenever an order is marked complete on Science Exchange, the requester has the opportunity to leave a review. Another factor that influences search rankings is Endorsements, which can be left by anyone who has a Science Exchange account. NPS scores are also collected from requesters, which show up on your Storefront under Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, please see our blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.scienceexchange.com/2015/09/how-the-search-feature-on-science-exchange-ranks-search-providers-in-the-results/&quot;&gt;How does Science Exchange rank service providers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: Why is my service pending?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2101</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-why-is-my-service-pending/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To add new experimental services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin typing your experiment name in the “Name” field. Choose the closest match from the drop-down service list that appears. If no appropriate matches  appear, try synonyms or acronyms of the experiment name. Remember that anything you list in the service description will show up in search results when users search the platform, but the actual experiment/service names need to conform to the hierarchy structure we have in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the experiment name you would like to add does not exist in our database yet, you can create a new service name which will be marked as “Pending” until verified by Science Exchange. When creating a new experiment name, please adhere to the Service Naming Guidelines provided below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Service-Naming-Guidelines-1-1.docx&quot;&gt;Service-Naming-Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: How do I add Lab Members?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2100</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-how-do-i-add-lab-members/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Click “Manage” next to the “Lab Members” section on the right side of your Storefront. Then click the green Add Lab Members button. You can add anyone with a Science Exchange account. If they need to sign up for an account, they can join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/signup&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Type in their name and select the correct user from the drop-down menu. Add their title. Then you can choose to make them a Lab Admin if applicable. Lab Admins have access to the Settings tab, which allows them to edit payment information as well as the general information on your Storefront, in addition to being able to respond to customer requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: How do I add and edit Services?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2099</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-how-do-i-add-and-edit-services/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Services section is the most important area of your Storefront. To add services, sign in and press the Manage Storefront button. Then click the green Add Services button. Start typing the name into the name field and select your service from the drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a description or leave it blank, but the more information you provide, the better requesters will be able to understand your capabilities. Plus, our search engine pulls information from the Services description, so adding more information helps with your search rankings. Be sure to add the information customers are looking for, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animals models, cell lines, and/or antibodies you have access to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample requirements (what is required from researcher to perform the experiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliverables for each service (including returned samples if appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average turnaround times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting prices for more commoditized services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add Service Tags that help optimize your search results such as equipment, species, or therapeutic area. Just type the service tag in the name field, and select it from the drop-down menu. If you make any changes, press the green Save Changes button.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: How do I manage and optimize my Provider Profile?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2098</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/provider-how-do-i-manage-and-optimize-my-storefront/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;You have full control over the information listed on your Provider Profile, also called your Storefront. To get started editing your Storefront, sign in and click “Dashboard”, you will see your Activities, Storefront, Orders, Settings, Marketing, and Reports tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the Storefront Tab, and then the Edit Lab button. The Edit Lab button allows you to update your lab logo, location, and the general summary of your company, which can include your company’s history, capabilities, and any service that you would like to highlight. This is also where you are able to add Lab Tags (either Diversity or License) which can set your Storefront apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left hand side, you also have more options to customize your Storefront. Upload files to the Resources section such as sample preparation, shipping and handling information, example data, etc. Or, upload Lab Photos of your team, facility, or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Services section is the most important area of your Storefront. To add services, sign in and press the Manage Storefront button. Then click the green Add Services button. Start typing the name into the name field and select your service from the drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a description to your Service or leave it blank, but the more information you provide, the better requesters will be able to understand your capabilities. Also, be sure to add the information customers are looking for, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Instrumentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Animals models, cell lines, and/or antibodies you have access to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Sample requirements (what is required from the researcher in order to perform the experiment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Deliverables for each service (including returned samples if appropriate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Average turnaround times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Starting prices for more commoditized services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also add Service Tags such as equipment, species, or therapeutic area. Just type the service tag in the name field, and select it from the drop-down menu. Be sure to save if you make any changes by clicking the green Save Changes button.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you choose to arrange your own shipment, we recommend that you post the tracking number to the order page to keep the Service Provider informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the service provider finishes processing your order, they will mark your order as complete. At this time, please review the deliverables and click the green &lt;strong&gt;‘Confirm Completion’&lt;/strong&gt; button to finalize your order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payment is due to Science Exchange after the service provider completes your order.

	<description>A food packaging journal plans to retract a 2018 article by Thai researchers who tried to repackage (ahem) a virtually identical article of theirs, Retraction Watch has learned. That’s not particularly unusual; duplication, sometimes inaccurately called “self-plagiarism,” happens, as they say.

&lt;p&gt;As every parent knows, gentle rocking helps a baby to fall asleep. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31662-2?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218316622?showall=true&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt; by researchers in Switzerland, shows that a rocking bed also benefits adults, extending the time that they spend in deep, slow-wave sleep, helping them sleep more soundly, and increasing their memory consolidation through the night. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31608-7?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218316087?showall=true&quot;&gt;related rocking study&lt;/a&gt; on mice, conducted by a team involving some of the same researchers, and published in the same journal issue, helps to reveal how rocking might have these effects.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36242&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurence Bayer at the University of Geneva and colleagues had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211005392&quot;&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that continuous rocking during a 45-minute nap helped adults to fall asleep and to sleep more deeply. For the new study, they wanted to explore the effects of rocking during an entire night.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen healthy young adults spent a first night getting used to the custom-built bed, which swayed back and forth every four seconds, moving a total of 10.5 centimetres. Next came two experimental nights. One was spent in the rocking bed, and one in a standard bed. During both nights, EEG was used to monitor their brain activity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocking didn’t help the participants enter the first stage of early, light sleep any faster, nor was their REM sleep affected. But they did spend less time in the first few stages of sleep, and nearly a quarter more time in deep slow-wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer and her colleagues also noticed that rocking increased the number of “sleep spindles” during slow wave sleep. These bursts of coherent brain activity are known to help prevent a sleeper from briefly waking – and on the nights the participants were rocked, there was an association between an increase in the “fast” form of sleep spindles and reduced awakenings. (Though brief arousals are common during sleep, they do interfere with normal cycling between the various sleep stages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spindle activity during slow wave sleep is also known to relate to the replaying of memories, which is important for memory consolidation. On the evening before each of the experimental nights, the participants were given a series of word pairs to learn before being tested immediately and then again when they woke in the morning. They performed better on the morning memory test after a night of rocking than after a night in a normal bed. In fact, after a rocking night they did even better on the test than they had the previous evening (this overnight improvement didn’t occur after a night in a standard bed). “This increase in overnight memory accuracy was supported by a decrease in the number of errors and an increase in the number of correct responses only during the rocking night,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might rocking increase slow-wave sleep duration and reduce disruptive waking? “While the exact underlying neuronal mechanism cannot be fully elucidated here, we hypothesize that the rocking effect would be driven by the vestibular system,” they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for this comes in part from the companion study on mice. All-night rocking had slightly different impacts on mice vs. people: when their cages were rocked, the mice fell asleep faster and stayed asleep for longer, but there was no evidence that they slept more deeply. The effects of rocking vanished, however, in mice bred to lack functional otolithic organs. These organs, which form part of the vestibular system, sense forward/backward and sideways motion.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think rhythmic rocking may exert a kind of synchronising action in the brain, inducing a rhythmic pattern of activity in neural pathways from the thalamus, which receives signals from the vestibular system, on into the cortex, directly influencing the appearance of fast sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work is clearly needed to establish exactly what’s going on. But as far as the observed sleep effects themselves are concerned, as the researchers conclude, “These results may be relevant for the development of non-pharmacological therapies for patients with insomnia or mood disorders or even for ageing populations, who frequently suffer from decreased sleep and/or from memory impairments.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of personality in politics is often dismissed as idle gossip, but politicians’ personalities inform their policy choices, shape their campaigning style and predict their chances of electoral success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there has been much speculation that personality may be key to understanding perhaps the biggest electoral shock ever – Donald Trump’s triumph in the 2016 US Presidential election. Many commentators have highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/08/clintons-and-trumps-personality-profiles-according-to-psychologists/&quot;&gt;Trump’s unusually brash, extraverted and narcissistic personality&lt;/a&gt; and proposed that it may &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/&quot;&gt;partly explain his appeal among some voters&lt;/a&gt;. However, before now, there has been little systematic evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psq.12511&quot;&gt;new open-access paper in &lt;em&gt;Presidential Studies Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; addressed this lack of evidence, surveying  875 international experts about the personality traits of 103 political leaders, including Trump and 20 other populists, who took part in 47 elections in 40 countries around the world between 2015 and 2016. Alessandro Nai and his colleagues found that Trump’s traits were rated at the extremes even in comparison to other populist leaders, suggesting a “truly unique and off-the-charts public persona”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36221&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participating experts, who had a slight left-leaning political bias, had academic backgrounds in “electoral politics, political communication (including political journalism), and/ or electoral behaviour”. They each evaluated one political candidate using an established Big Five personality questionnaire and a shortened version of a Dark Triad questionnaire to tap less savoury traits (such that each politician was rated by multiple experts – Trump, for instance, was rated by 75 experts). The experts also scored the candidates’ campaigning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team were careful to explain that “we do not claim to measure the candidates’ actual psychological profile – and even less, the clinical components of their psyche – but rather their perceived personality (reputation).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the judgment of the participating experts, Trump’s personality is extremely extraverted; extremely low on agreeableness; extremely low on conscientiousness; extremely neurotic (i.e. low emotional stability); and also extremely high on narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism. The only trait where he was rated as average was openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when compared against other populist leaders, Trump came out as having the lowest scores of all on agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability, and the highest scores for narcissism and Machiavellianism. On extraversion he was only outscored by Vladimir Zhironovsky of Russia, and on trait psychopathy only by Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland and Nikola Gruevski of Macedonia. Trump scored significantly higher on all the Dark Triad traits when compared against the average scores of the other populist leaders, making him in the researchers’ words, “an outlier among the outliers”. And when comparing his profile against the average for non-populist leaders, the difference is “staggering”, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of campaigning style, Trump scored very high for the negative tone of his tactics and his use of appeals to voters’ fears, and he had the single highest score for use of character attacks. This fits with the general pattern in the data for traits like low agreeableness and low conscientiousness, and high Dark Triad scores, to correlate with negative campaigning styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Nai’s team believe their data show that what is unique about Trump is not his lack of political experience (other world leaders, like Macron, share this background) nor his personal wealth (again there are other examples, like Putin and Berlusconi), but his personality style. “Systematic comparison between Trump’s public persona and the profiles of other mainstream and populist candidates shows that Trump is, indeed, off the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this new study provides fairly comprehensive comparative data on Trump’s personality and that of many other global politicians, and also demonstrates that there are meaningful associations between politicians’ personalities and their campaigning styles, what it doesn’t do is provide causal evidence that Trump’s personality was the reason for his electoral success, nor for his subsequent behaviour in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team do allow themselves to speculate about the future, however. They point out that given previous research on US presidents’ and other politicians’ personalities – suggesting, among other things, that strong extraverts tend to be more successful, narcissists are willing to take more risks, and disagreeable leaders pass more legislation successfully – that they would “advocate for caution when assuming that Trump will necessarily be a president without major achievements at the end of his term(s)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side, past research suggests narcissistic leaders tend to allow more unethical behaviour among their subordinates, and note that Trump scored very low on conscientiousness, a trait previously associated with success among former presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall,” the researchers concluded, “the comparison of [Trump’s] profile with trends in the literature suggests that Trump will continue to be in campaign mode and be relatively successful in (short-term) crisis management, agenda setting, and the setup of new legislative initiatives. At the same time, his profile will undoubtedly drive impulsive decisions … ” They added, “our results could support the prediction that Trump will be a chaotic president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones. We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons m required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of n variables grows only linearly with n for deep neural networks, but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed. We also provide evidence that when the number of hidden layers is increased from 1 to k, the neuron requirement grows exponentially not with n but with n1/k, suggesting that the minimum number of layers required for practical expressibility grows only logarithmically with n.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08225&quot;&gt;Why does deep and cheap learning work so well? (Henry W. Lin, Max Tegmark and David Rolnick, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through &quot;cheap learning&quot; with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various &quot;no-flattening theorems&quot; showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2^n neurons in a single hidden layer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: A criticism of homo economicus (Or: people are neither rational nor irrational)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1570</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/a-criticism-of-homo-economicus-or-people-are-neither-rational-nor-irrational/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mainstream theory of economics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics&quot;&gt;neoclassical economics&lt;/a&gt;, is based on a very peculiar model of human behavior and social interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NeoclassicalEconomics.html&quot;&gt;The core assumption&lt;/a&gt; is that people’s behavior consists in maximizing “utility”, which is a measure of personal preferences. That is, each situation is assigned some utility and people choose the situation with maximal utility, by making the best possible use of available information. This is called “rational behavior” (this is somewhat related to the view in psychology that perceptual behavior is optimal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs&quot;&gt;which I have criticized&lt;/a&gt; on similar grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model has been criticized repeatedly on empirical grounds, in particular on the grounds that humans are actually not that rational, psychology has documented numerous cognitive biases, and so on. This line of criticism forms an entire field, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics&quot;&gt;behavioral economics&lt;/a&gt;. Epistemologically, economics is quite a particular field because lack of empirical evidence for its core models or even direct empirical contradiction does not seem to be a problem at all. One reason is that the ambition of economic theory is not just empirical but also normative, i.e., it also has a political dimension. In other words, if reality does not fit the model, then reality should be changed so as to fit it (hence the prescription of free markets). It is of course questionable that theories can be called scientific if they constitutively offer no possibility of empirical grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, although the assumptions of neoclassical economics have been pretty much demolished on empirical grounds by psychology (actual behavior of people) and anthropology (actual social interactions; see for example David Graeber’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years&quot;&gt;Debt: The First 5000 Years&lt;/a&gt;”), it still remains the dominant mode of economic thinking because it is intellectually appealing. Of course, political interference certainly has a role in this state of affairs, but here I want to focus on the intellectual aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the field of behavioral economics points out that humans actually do not behave “rationally”, those deviations are depicted as flaws or “bounds on rationality”. If you are not rational, then you are irrational. This is really not a radical criticism. We are bound to conclude that the rational agent is an approximation of real behavior, and everybody knows that a model cannot be exact. Perhaps the model could be amended, made more sophisticated, or perhaps we should educate people so that they are more rational (this seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman&quot;&gt;Daniel Kahneman&lt;/a&gt;’s view). But fundamentally, “rational behavior” is a sensible, if imperfect, model of human behavior and social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these criticisms miss is the fact that both “rational behavior” and “irrational behavior” have in common several implicit assumptions, which are not only empirically questionable but also absurd foundations for an economic theory – and which therefore cannot ground a normative approach any more than an empirical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The first problem is with the idea of “rationality”. Rationality is something that belongs to the domain of logics, and therefore which can only be exerted on a particular model. Thus, to describe human behavior as “rational”, we must first assume that there exists a fixed model of the world and personal preferences, and that this model is not a subject of inquiry. In particular, personal preferences are given and cannot be changed. If, however, the advertisement business is not totally foolish, then this is wrong. Not only do personal preferences change, but one way of satisfying your own desires is by manipulating the desires of others, and this appears to be a large part of the activity of modern multinational companies. The fact that personal preferences are actually not fixed has two problematic consequences: 1) you cannot frame behavior as optimization if the optimization criterion is also a free parameter, 2) it becomes totally unclear how satisfying people’s preferences is supposed to be a good thing, if that means making them want what you sell, rather than selling them what they need; what preexisting economic problem is being solved in this way? Personal preferences can also be changed by the individual itself: for example she can decide, after reflection, that buying expensive branded clothes is futile (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance&quot;&gt;cognitive dissonance theory&lt;/a&gt; about how people change their preferences and beliefs). But again, if that possibility is on the table, then how can we even define “rational behavior”? is it to buy the expensive cloth or is it to change the “utility function”? Assuming preferences are fixed properties of people is the move that allows economic theory to avoid philosophical and in particular ethical questions (what is “good”? see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism&quot;&gt;stoicism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism&quot;&gt;buddhism&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the possibility that people influence each other for various reasons (manipulation, but also conversation and education). Unfortunately those questions do not disappear just by ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The assumption of “rationality” also assumes that people have a fixed model of the world over which that rationality is exerted. They do not learn, for example, and they do not need to be taught either. They just happen to know everything useful there is to know about the world. Building an adequate model of the world, of the consequences of one’s actions, is considered outside the realm of economic theory. But in a normative perspective, this is really paradoxical. One aim of economic theory is to devise efficient organizations of work, in particular which ensure the distribution of accurate information to the relevant people. But by postulating that people are “rational agents”, economic theory considers as already solved the problem it is supposed to address in the first place. In other words, the problem of designing rational organizations of production is dismissed by postulating that people are rational. No wonder that this view leads to the bureaucratization of economy (see David Graeber’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs&quot;&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and Béatrice Hibou’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137495273&quot;&gt;The Bureaucratization of the World in the Neoliberal Era&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Finally, implicit with the idea of “rational behavior” is caricatural reductionism. That is, the presumption that the optimization of individual preferences is realized at the individual level. This, in fact, amounts to neglecting the possibility that there are social interactions – quite problematic for a social science. A well-known example in game theory is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;prisoner’s dilemma&lt;/a&gt;: two criminals are arrested; if they both remain silent, they will do one year in prison; if one betrays the other, he is set free and the other goes to jail for three years; if both betray the other, they both go to jail for two years. Whatever the other decides to do, it is always in your best interest to betray him: this would be the “rational behavior”. The paradox is that two “rational” criminals would end up in jail for two years, while two “irrational” criminals that would not betray each other would do just one year. Thus, “rationality” is not necessarily the most advantageous way to organize social interactions. Or to rephrase, individual rationality is not the same as collective rationality. This is of course a well-known problem in economy, in particular in the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot;&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;” version. But again, this tends to be depicted as an amendment to be made to the core assumption of rationality (cf the concept of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality&quot;&gt;externalities&lt;/a&gt;”), when it actually demonstrates the fallacy of the concept of “individual rationality”. Accordingly, neoclassical economists propose to solve the problem by incentives (e.g. carbon tax). But first of all, this is not the same as building collective infrastructures. And second, what this means is that anything that cannot be modeled as independent individual actions is not addressed by the economic theory, but instead must be tailored in the form of an “incentive structure”. Each collective problem now requires its own complex “incentive structure” designed in such a way that the “free” play of individual rationalities ensures the collective good, which is to say that each collective problem must be solved in an ad hoc way outside of the conceptual framework of theory. In other words, with its focus on “rational behavior”, neoclassical economics sets out to solve exclusively problems that do not involve social interactions. It is not clear, then, what the theory is meant to solve in the first place (how omniscient independent agents manage to organize themselves?), or to demonstrate (selfishness entails collective good, except when it doesn’t?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is actually an important theme of evolutionary theory. Namely, how can social species exist at all, if individualist behavior is rewarded by increased survival and reproduction rate? The answer that evolutionary theory has come to, as well as anthropology and ethology of social animals including primates (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal&quot;&gt;Frans de Waal&lt;/a&gt;’s books), is that social animals display a variety of non-individualist behaviors based on altruism, reciprocity and authority, which ensure successful social interactions and therefore are beneficial for the species. In other words, studies in all those non-economic fields have concurred to demonstrate that efficient collective organizations are not based on individual rationality. This conclusion is not immensely surprising, yet it is essentially the opposite of mainstream economic theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the problem with the “rational behavior” model of human behavior that subtends neoclassical economics is not that people are “irrational”. The problem is that framing human behavior in terms of individual rationality already assumes from the outset that 1) people already have an accurate model of the world, and so no social organization is required to ensure that people’s actions have their intended consequences, this is already solved by people’s “rationality”; 2) people have preexisting fixed “preferences”, and so we don’t need to care about what a “good society” might mean, this is already taken care of by the “preferences”; 3) there is no collective rationality beyond individual rationality, and so there is in fact no society at all, just a group of independent people. Thus, the epistemological implications of the “rational behavior” model are in fact tremendous: essentially, the model amounts to putting aside all the problems that economic theory is supposed to solve in the first place. In other words, the “rational behavior” model of neoclassical economics is not just empirically wrong, it is also theoretically absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.: This is partially related to a recent discussion in perceptual psychology on the presumed optimality of human behavior. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485020&quot;&gt;Rahnev &amp;amp; Denison&lt;/a&gt; (2018) review an extensive literature to show that in perceptual tasks, people are actually not optimal. These findings are referred to in the title as “suboptimality”, but in my view this is an unfortunate terminology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs&quot;&gt;My objection&lt;/a&gt; to this terminology is that it implicitly accepts the framework of optimization, in which there already is a fixed model of the world for which we only need to tune the parameters. But this means ignoring what perception is largely about, namely modeling the world (object formation, scene analysis, etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>What, if anything, is the function of adult neurogenesis in humans? Does neurogenesis even exist in our adult brains, or does it shut down during childhood?

The debate over human neurogenesis has been one of the most prominent disputes in 21st century neuroscience. Just last year, two opposing papers appeared in leading journals, one claiming firm evidence of ongoing neurogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus, while the other study came to the opposite conclusion. The fact that adult neuro</description>

&lt;p&gt;The profession of “criminal profiler” is one shrouded in secrecy, even giving off a hint of danger. Yet when the American psychiatrist James A. Brussel began profiling a particular suspect in the 1950s, law enforcement officers were not entirely inclined to trust him. However, it turned out Brussel accurately defined the suspect’s height, clothing and even religion. This spectacular success was the beginning of the profession of the profiler. The FBI formed its Behavioral Science Unit in 1974 to study serial predators. Since then, the art and craft of criminal profiling have become the subject of numerous books, TV shows and iconic films such as &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;. Criminal profilers are not, however, just characters created to make interesting films and books – in the real world the accuracy of their expert opinions is often key to protecting the safety and lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we say, after the passage of 40 years since the job of offender profiling (OP) was established, that this profession is a craft worthy of trust, one whose practitioners make use of tried and tested tools, or rather would it be more accurate to describe it as an art-form grounded in intuition that supplies us with foggy, uncertain predictions? Answers to these questions are given by Bryanna Fox from the University of South Florida and David P. Farrington from the University of Cambridge &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-58808-003&quot;&gt;in the December edition of &lt;i&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where they present a systematic review and meta-analysis of 426 publications on OP from 1976 through 2016.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36211&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fox and Farrington assure us that the field of offender profiling has made considerable improvement in the scientific rigor of its research, I believe a closer look at their results do not give us much cause for optimism. The problem is OP is a field whose beginnings had such little scientific rigor that even though things have improved there is still such a long way to go.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the proportion of OP publications using advanced statistical analyses has risen substantially, but while they were at 0 per cent four decades ago, the figure still stands at just 33 per cent. In the past ten years the number of peer-reviewed studies out-paced non-peer reviewed publications by a margin of three to one, which sounds like good news. However, the new review demonstrates that OP has been studied quite poorly and a science that fails after so long to uncover any meaningful effects is arguably nothing more than a cargo cult science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, despite being applied often in active police investigations, very few evaluations of the profiles’ accuracy or effectiveness have taken place. Less than 10 per cent of all publications contained evaluations of existing profiles or profiling strategies conducted to determine the level of accuracy of these profiles and methods.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, no previous analysis has determined the specific recurring themes or criminal profile categories that exist within the body of publications on OP. Fox and Farrington took up this task, analysing 62 publications that have developed offender profiles. They found considerable variation in the number, characteristics and terminology used to describe otherwise similar profile types, which, by the way, have little in common with the pop culture depiction of the “Organized” and “Disorganized” serial killer profiles originally proposed by agents in the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit in the 1980s. The recurring profile themes or category types found by Fox and Farrington in the literature included: expressive, instrumental, visionary, hedonistic, power/control, traveling and local homicide offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide variety in methods and terminology used across the field is striking. Some authors proposed profiles on the basis of their investigative experience or the modus operandi at the crime scene, while others drew on their reviews of the OP literature or a statistical analysis of all available crime scene information. This wide variety makes synthesis of the findings of OP as a whole very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far greater cause for optimism is given by the results of the meta-analysis of case-linkage analysis research from 2002 to 2016. Case linkage is the process of determining whether there are discrete connections, or distinctive behavioural factors, that associate two or more previously unrelated cases by means of crime scene analysis, such as victim selection/targeting, method of approach and attack, location type, nature and sequence of sexual acts, any verbal activity, modus operandi, signature behaviour, and the amount of time spent in the commission of the crime. Results indicate that, in general, case linkage analysis can be used successfully to link crimes in a series of offences committed by a single offender. In fact, well over half of all reported analyses of case-linkage accuracy were statistically in the moderate to strong range, whereas almost 20 per cent were very strong.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the tremendous strides made by OP in relation to where it began 40 years ago, the results of this new review suggest OP nevertheless mostly still fails to meet the “Daubert standard” – originating from a 1993 case and now employed widely in the USA, this standard defines the scientific credibility that must be passed for evidence to be presented in courtrooms. Specifically, there is no known reliability or error rate for the vast number of methodologies or profiles developed in the OP field. Yet Fox and Farrington remain optimistic. They believe that: ”OP appears to be on a positive trajectory in terms of the use of more scientific and statistical methods, data and analyses, and evaluations of our work. Continuation on this trajectory, particularly in the next 10 years, will help the field of OP transform from a ‘cocktail napkin psuedoscience’ into an evidence-based discipline that produces research used to help police, inform policy, and ultimately, make the world a safer place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will be the case. Today, however, our answer to the question posed in 1976 by British forensic psychiatrist Colin Campbell about criminal profiling in an article for &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;– “Are we better at this than a bartender?” – is a simple, “not necessarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-58808-003&quot;&gt;What Have We Learned From Offender Profiling? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 40 Years of Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: Out of facebook and into the real world</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.mariannebezaire.com/?p=175</guid>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/01/29/out-of-facebook-and-into-the-real-world/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a year almost completely off of facebook recently. It was a peaceful experience. At the end of the year, I then deleted my entire account, thinking that I wouldn’t miss it at all after being offline for that long. But I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the whole account was gone, I started to think: did I just disown my whole past? All my pictures stored in the account, many of which were otherwise lost to the digital ether, are now gone. All the folks I knew from past years but didn’t talk to regularly are now effectively lost to the present unless I do some serious sleuthing. And all the folks I’ve met over the past few years and want to be friends with, it’s hard to connect with now. It feels as though my ambient connection to the broader social world was somehow lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I find myself thinking more fondly of folks from my past as they cross my mind. Sure, I can’t just look up how they are doing today on facebook and spy on their spouses who I met once or twice a decade ago and their kids who I’ve never met and probably never will meet. Or peek into their current hobbies and daily struggles, stories, and vacation photos. But now that I can’t see how far their futures have diverged from mine, I feel closer to them. I just have the memories of the times we spent together in real life to keep me company. And I somehow find those memories more peaceful and heartwarming than the photos of their actual lives as they live them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I think I would like to be a part of their lives today even more than I like to have the memories of them. Perhaps an annual video chat or at least to get on their holiday card circulation list. But until I regain the nerve to cold-call my high school study buddy from two decades ago, the memories are pretty enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Oscillatory Thoughts: DIY Brain Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5648062351012720545.post-5253043828152171437</guid>
	<link>http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/12/diy-brain-stimulation.html</link>
	<description>A few months ago I wrote a piece for the BBC on the foc.us do-it-yourself, consumer-based brain stimulator. &lt;a href=&quot;http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/voytek_bbc_focus.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here's the article in full&lt;/a&gt;; full text follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries people have sought quick fixes and miracle cures to enhance our vitality and make us faster, stronger, smarter, younger. Historically speaking, many of these &quot;fixes&quot; have been pharmacological. Freud used cocaine to improve his mood and treat his patients while Queen Victoria was known to enjoy a wine infused with the drug. In fact it's only relatively recently – the late 1960s – that the sale of amphetamines was made illegal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it seems the next form of mental stimulant could come in the shape of a piece of technology, and not a drug. Looking like something Star Trek's Borg might wear, the foc.us device promises to &quot;make your synapses fire faster&quot; with the application of a small electrical current to the brain for 30 minutes. The promised result is that you'll have sharpened reflexes and faster reactions. As a gamer, I can see the attraction. Those extra split seconds can make all the difference. It's certainly a shrewd business decision too: video games were a £43 billion ($67 billion) dollar industry in 2012, and professional gaming draws in sponsorship and viewing figures that rival physical sports. The company's bold claims may draw in others looking for a mental boost, and not just people who like to play video games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OEKloCMXV5k/UqJL-LcD7EI/AAAAAAAAFv4/ew6tgTh0k_s/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-12-06+at+2.12.39+PM.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately as a scientist I'm sceptical. The technique being used by the foc.us headset is known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the scientific world, studies using it have actually been quite promising. In carefully controlled experiments, low-level electrical excitation of just the right brain regions have provided a small boost to task performance. After a quick zap, volunteers have gotten slightly better at noticing if a square changed colour (after an hour of watching flashing coloured squares). But could this really extend to a task as complex as playing a video game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general idea is that if a certain brain region is involved in cognition – attention for example – then stimulating that area with an electrical pulse (priming it) should improve your ability to attend to what's happening around you. We also know that when you're engaged in a complex cognitive task (like playing Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare), certain neurones in specific brain areas fire more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I imagine the thinking at foc.us is that if we can speed up the rate of neuronal firing we should be able to enhance gaming ability. Unfortunately, that's a little like saying, &quot;I can boost my computer's memory by jolting its hard drive with a battery!&quot; – your IT department won't be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sometimes tDCS provides a cognitive benefit; the data is indisputable. I myself make use of this technology in my lab. But its capabilities are too non- specific. In the brain, it matters which neurones are excited; alcohol excites a lot of neurones, but no one would claim that drinking four pints sharpens your reflexes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while stimulation methods have been proven to be safe for use in controlled experimental situations over the short- term, we don't know about long–term effects. We've been down this road before. Over the short term the data was very clear: cocaine and amphetamines were very effective at enhancing energy and mood, but we didn't know about long-term negative consequences. I will never say that we shouldn't test new drugs or new technology, but when companies promise to &quot;excite your prefrontal cortex&quot; to give you &quot;the edge in online gaming&quot; and &quot;let the force of electricity excite your neurones into firing faster&quot;, well... buyer beware.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s unlikely that a girl would ride a hippo or that a boy would drink onion juice, but as adults, we know that it’s not &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;. However, and in contrast to adults’ reasoning, for some time researchers have noticed a “striking phenomenon” (to quote the authors of a new paper) in young children’s thinking  – that is, up to around the age of eight, they frequently assume that improbable events are actually impossible. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-63736-001&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Celina Bowman-Smith at the University of Waterloo and her colleagues have investigated whether asking children to consider the possibility of hypothetical events in a distant, far away country might help them to overcome this closed-minded thinking and realise that improbable doesn’t mean impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36199&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory for why children think the improbable is impossible is that they call to mind relevant knowledge and experience and if they’ve never heard of what is being proposed – such as a girl riding a hippo, or a boy drinking onion juice – then they conclude such a thing cannot happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman-Smith and her team figured that asking children to consider the possibility of improbable scenarios in far-away lands might help them break free of this reasoning strategy, to think beyond their own experiences and be more open-minded. Certainly the approach works for adults, who rate improbable events as more likely when they consider them in the context of distant lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three studies, 300 Canadian children aged between five and seven years stated whether various scenarios were possible, including improbable ones (other examples included that a girl had a pet zebra or that a person could have a beard growing all the way to the ground), truly impossible ones (e.g. a person grew wings; a girl rode a dragon), or ordinary ones (e.g. a person could have a pet dog). Some of the children were asked to consider the possibility of the scenarios in their own country of Canada, others in “a country very far away”, and for others the location was not specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were age differences in the children’s answers. The younger participants were more inclined to say that improbable events were impossible (for instance, they claimed this was the case for around 80 per cent of the improbable events in an unspecified location, on average, compared with a 50 per cent figure for the older kids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location also made a difference. Both younger and older children increased their acknowledgement of the possibility of improbable events when they were considering them in the context of a far-away land. This distance effect was larger for the older children – they were up to 23 per cent more likely to say improbable events were possible in a far away place (compared with an increase of up to 17 per cent in the younger children).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another age effect interacted with location, such that older children tended to say improbable events were &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to occur in Canada than in an unspecified location, whereas younger children’s estimates did not vary between Canada and the unspecified location, thus suggesting older children were extra conservative in judging what can happen at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[T]hinking about distant lands is not a panacea for improving children’s reasoning about physical possibility,” the researchers said. “Nonetheless, the efficacy of this manipulation relative to other manipulations [explored in prior research, such as asking children to visualise improbable events happening] suggests that broadening the context in which children construe events may be a promising method for helping overcome their skepticism about the possibility of extraordinary events.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-63736-001&quot;&gt;Distant lands make for distant possibilities: Children view improbable events as more possible in far-away locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: iMT: Creating a Blueprint for Cortical Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11329</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/imt-creating-a-blueprint-for-cortical-connectivity/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have developed a novel technique capable of tracing intricate neural connections with unprecedented sensitivity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bit of light, a few photo sensitive compounds and specialized paper, the blueprint was born. As the favored type of technical drawing for over a century, architects used this crucial tool for its fast reproducibility as well as its capacity for detailed documentation. For workers on a build site, the document was equally essential as it contained all the necessary design information, the specific types of components included, and served as a guide detailing how everything fit together. If there was ever any doubt, more often than not a quick consult with the blueprint resolved questions and progressed stalled construction forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when neuroscientists have questions about the brain and the intricate connections within? Is there even such a thing as a brain blueprint? Despite an ever-growing body of work uncovering how neurons in the brain form connections, researchers still lack a comprehensive diagram detailing their wiring. Establishing this would have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of the brain, uncovering how the unique circuitry of individual structures endow us with extraordinary abilities like language, sensory perception and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the first step towards actualizing a blueprint of the brain, researchers from the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), have developed a novel technique capable of tracing intricate neural connections with unprecedented sensitivity. In a recent publication in Nature Neuroscience, researchers in the lab of Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, have demonstrated both the unparalleled specificity and high throughput nature of the approach. By innovatively combining cutting-edge genetic tools with the established technique of monosynaptic tracing, the Taniguchi Lab has created a powerful new tool named intersectional monosynaptic tracing (iMT), capable of unraveling the elaborate circuits within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Press-Release-Figure-1B-FINAL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Press-Release-Figure-1B-FINAL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schematic of intersectional monosynaptic tracing (iMT) principle.&lt;/strong&gt; iMT is a novel genetic strategy combining the principle of rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing with a Cre/Flp recombinase dependent intersectional labeling method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying a specialized class of brain cell known as inhibitory interneurons, the Taniguchi Lab is interested in looking into how these diverse cells assemble into circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex. Normally, these cells act to refine, shape and balance information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Elucidating how these inhibitory circuits function, will pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. One challenging aspect hindering the elucidation of cortical circuits, is the sheer diversity of neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Taniguchi explains, “While cellular diversity makes the brain so unique, it also conveys a great difficulty in the study of individual circuits. Take for instance the typical inhibitory circuit that we study in the lab; one excitatory principal neuron that transmits information over long distances from one brain region to another, and multiple inhibitory neurons that form connections with it. At first glance this model seems fairly simple but in reality, there are many diverse types of principal and inhibitory interneurons. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make very specific connections depending on a principal neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Without the ability to take a look at the specific connections formed by each subpopulation of inhibitory neuron, an accurate picture of the circuit cannot be formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Yetman, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Taniguchi Lab and first author of the paper notes that they wanted a technique that could cut through the cellular diversity of the brain, and only target specific subtypes of neurons. “This way, we could compare and contrast the connections of each unique subtype and study the types of circuits they form,” explains Yetman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMT was developed with this goal in mind, overcoming limitations of previously used methods to trace connections within the brain. Techniques such as electrical stimulation and monosynaptic tracing, were either too inefficient or lacked the sensitivity necessary to precisely trace connections from many different cell types found in the brain. iMT builds upon its predecessor, but with an innovative twist that is critical for conveying the technique’s sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Monosynaptic tracing utilizes a modified form of the rabies virus that lacks a necessary protein, restricting the virus to a single, starter cell and preventing infection of other cells around it,” explains Yetman. “But if the protein along with the virus is expressed in only the starter cell, then the virus has the ability to jump and infect nearby cells. For studying neurons within the brain, we can express the virus and protein in a principal neuron and watch as the virus jumps the synaptic connections to only the interneurons directly connected. Once there, the virus in a sense gets stuck without the necessary protein and tells the neuron to start expressing fluorescent protein. With microscopy, we can see the cells that are directly connected to our starter neuron. The limitation is that we could only visualize the connected interneurons as a whole, missing the unique properties of individual subtypes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this limitation, the team has added an additional genetic component that reliably and specifically targets single subtypes of interneurons. Once the virus reaches a cell subtype that contains this component, a second new fluorescent protein is expressed. Now scientists have the ability to visualize the interneuron connections as a whole as well as connections of specific interneuron subtypes. Already iMT has proved groundbreaking, revealing dramatic differences in the interneuron circuit design of key inhibitory subtypes as well those of the same subtype that form connections with principal neurons of different brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though iMT is only in the first stages of development, it has the potential to provide a more detailed, brain-wide circuit diagram that will be essential for combating prominent brain disorders,” notes Yetman. “In the future we hope to further the technique to include the capability of studying the functional, and not just physical, connections of neural circuits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMT and the neuroscientists at MPFI, are taking us one step closer to achieving the construction of a concrete cortical blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A high-profile researcher at the Universidad de Oviedo in Spain has retracted eight papers from the Journal of Biological Chemistry for figure issues. All of the papers were co-authored by Carlos López-Otín, who studies a group of enzymes that break down proteins, cancer genomics and aging, and whose lab web site boasts that His works … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/28/biochemist-in-spain-retracts-eight-papers-at-once/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Biochemist in Spain retracts eight papers at once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: A Surprising New Way To Avoid Choking Under Pressure – Imagine You Have The Prize And Are Performing To Keep It</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=36136</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/28/a-surprising-new-way-to-avoid-choking-under-pressure-imagine-you-have-the-prize-and-are-performing-to-keep-it/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choking is a ubiquitous and extremely frustrating human weakness – as the stakes are raised, our performance usually improves, but only up to a point, beyond which the pressure gets too much and our skills suddenly deteriorate. Any new psychological tricks to ameliorate this problem will be welcomed by sports competitors, students and anyone else who needs to be at their best under high pressure situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/14/1/13/5210274&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; documents a new technique for reducing choking that has to do with altering how you look at what is at stake. Moreover, the research shows how this act of reappraisal is reflected in altered activity in a key brain area that’s previously been implicated in how well we can maintain our fine motor control under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36136&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important to understanding the new research is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/34/45/14833.full.pdf&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published a few years ago. A team led by Vikram Chib at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine first showed – just as you’d expect – that as they raised the monetary stakes, people were more likely to choke at a computer-based task that required fine motor control and coordination, and that this was especially true for people who are more “loss averse”, as identified by their choices in an earlier gambling game – that is, these folk were more motivated to avoid losing money they had, rather than risking what money they had to gain more (loss aversion is a general human tendency, but some people are more loss averse than others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also scanned their participants’ brains during the task and found the behavioural results were reflected in the activity of a key brain structure known as the ventral striatum. As the stakes on offer were raised, this was at first mirrored in increased activity in this brain structure (an effect also well-established by prior research). However, among highly loss averse participants, when they began the motor task, activity in their ventral striatum dramatically reduced, and there was less communication between this brain structure and motor control regions at the front of the brain. And the more this happened, the more the participants tended to choke and their performance suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers interpreted this as a kind of neurally mediated switch in mindset – once the loss averse participants started performing, they saw the large monetary prize on offer not as something to be gained, but something to be &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; if they failed at the task – thus, triggering an aversive emotional reaction, mediated by lost activity in ventral striatum, and contributing to consequent counterproductive loss of motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This postulated switching process is critical for understanding the new technique for reducing choking, which I’ll come to shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, when the researchers altered the stakes of the task, so that there was no money to be won, but rather success meant keeping (i.e. not losing) money the participants already had, then the more loss averse participants were now &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; prone to choking at higher monetary amounts (and this was reflected in their showing a smaller reduction of ventral striatum activity during performance of the task, thus avoiding the adverse effect this lost activity could have on motor control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This earlier surprising finding is the inspiration for the new technique for reducing choking. It seems non-sensical at first: why would loss averse participants be less adversely affected by the pressure of performing to avoid the risk of &lt;em&gt;losing&lt;/em&gt; a large amount of money? The researchers think it’s because of the aforementioned neurally mediated mindset switch, but this time operating in the other direction – the participants saw success as a chance to &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt; the at-risk money, which for them was less aversive than the other “perform-to-win money” scenario (in turn, in the “performing-to-keep their money” situation they did not experience counterproductive emotional and neural effects on their performance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the new research – inspired by their previous results, Chib and his colleagues, including first author Simon Dunne at the California Institute of Technology, wondered if, in a typical “perform-to-win money” scenario, it might be possible for participants to consciously alter how they viewed these stakes – to pretend, in effect, that they were performing to avoid losing their money, thus tricking their brains into staying calmer under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the same computer-based motor task in a brain scanner as before and, in a baseline control condition, they showed that when the monetary reward for success was high, participants were more likely to choke. But then they coached their participants to reappraise the stakes – to simply imagine that they already had the high prize money on offer and were performing for the chance to keep that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mental technique dramatically reduced choking, and in fact it did so for all participants, not just those who were more loss averse (it’s possible the strength of the intervention overshadowed any differences in individuals’ loss aversion tendencies). Also, this beneficial effect of the reappraisal strategy was reflected in reduced activity levels in the ventral striatum specifically at the time that the stakes were first presented to the participants, when activity in this structure would normally encode the greater amounts of money on offer (it’s as if the brain was tricked into being less focused on the size of the stakes). Also, the more that ventral striatum activity was reduced during the presentation of the stakes, the less the participants choked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers also measured participants’ skin conductance on their fingers – a measure of perspiration that signals greater stress levels. They found that in the reappraisal condition participants no longer showed signs of heightened stress when they failed at the task – further evidence that the reappraisal intervention had taken the pressure out of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s put this new study in context. High stakes or incentives usually trigger choking by having an adverse effect on our emotional and cognitive control. Previously identified strategies for stopping choking have therefore focused on containing or countering these adverse effects – by using distraction, for instance, or forms of bodily relaxation, or visualising success. This new research represents a novel approach that is about reframing how one views the stakes at play, so that they do not even trigger such counterproductive cognitive and emotional processes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because this intervention targets the incentive directly, it may have the advantage of being applicable to a greater range of domains in which choking is caused by the effect of the incentive …” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers do not give examples of other contexts where this approach might be applied*. While it might be wise to wait for future research to test any such possibilities, I can imagine that in an academic exam context, you could try imagining you already had the university place and were performing to keep it; or in a sports context, you could imagine you already have the league points on the board and were performing to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/14/1/13/5210274&quot;&gt;Reappraisal of incentives ameliorates choking under pressure and is correlated with changes in the neural representations of incentives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I contacted them but have not heard back yet.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to write a sharp and subversive post.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Or at least compose a series of self-deprecating witticisms about persisting this long. Alas, it has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/10/there-is-giant-hole-where-my-heart-used.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;There Is a Giant Hole Where My Heart Used To Be&quot;&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/01/i-should-have-done-this-by-now.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;I should have done this by now... (Year 12)&quot;&gt;difficult year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I drew inspiration from Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neuroecology/status/1086350421508141059&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@neuroecology&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2019/01/low-on-agreeableness.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; who's been at it even longer than I (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DoctorZen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@DoctorZen&lt;/a&gt;). Very warily I might add, because I knew the results would not be flattering or pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behold my scores on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (more politely called 'negative emotionality')&quot;&gt;Big Five&lt;/a&gt;” personality traits (and weep). Some of the extremes are partly situational, and that's why I'm presenting these traits separately. Sure, negative emotionality is a relative fixed part of my personality, but the 100% scores on depression and anxiety are influenced by grief (due to the loss of my spouse of 12 years). Personality psychologists would turn this around and say that someone high in trait negative emotionality (formerly known as the more disparaging “neuroticism”) would be predisposed to depression and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4BByI3YQ9NQ/XE6YY4ip_AI/AAAAAAAAMvU/0nZDm-jqDS80SU5SNSxjAVOFUEHd6IYzACLcBGAs/s1600/Your%2Bnegative%2Bemotionality%2Bsubtraits_crop.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;402&quot; data-original-width=&quot;413&quot; height=&quot;309&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4BByI3YQ9NQ/XE6YY4ip_AI/AAAAAAAAMvU/0nZDm-jqDS80SU5SNSxjAVOFUEHd6IYzACLcBGAs/s320/Your%2Bnegative%2Bemotionality%2Bsubtraits_crop.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another fun trait score is shown below. This one might be even sadder.

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: I’ll wait for this news</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t decide, as I started drafting this first post, whether to write about the state of the academic journal system today or about how I somehow regret canceling my facebook account even though I hadn’t used it for a full year before canceling. But then an amazing Medium post showed up in my email and I just had to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, I’m not linking to that post here, that’s for a future date. And it’s going to be awesome! Today’s post is going to be bland. Not the best way to start a blog, but here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There once was a guy named Sylvester, or something similar. He’s been around a lot longer than I have. Somehow Sylvester successfully navigated through life without my knowledge until I was in my teens. I first heard of him because he was competent enough to sing a song and get it played on the radio! Over and over. I forgot about Sylvester for awhile until I heard about him again. This time it was because he had  created a system to abuse large numbers of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time I hear about R. Sylvester, I sincerely hope it’s because he managed – like a grown up – to successfully navigate our country’s criminal justice system without committing another felony and be safely secured in a jail for the rest of his life. This is a tough ask, because I’ve heard it can be difficult for people like Sylvester in jail. But I believe R. Sylvester Kelly can get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>NeuroFedora blog: NeuroFedora update: 2019 week 4</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:neurofedora.github.io,2019-01-27:/2019/01/27/neurofedora-update-2019-week-4.html</guid>
	<link>https://neurofedora.github.io/2019/01/27/neurofedora-update-2019-week-4.html</link>
	<description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroFedora logo&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, I had been posting updates &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ankursinha.in/tag/neurofedora/&quot;&gt;on my personal blog under the
NeuroFedora tag&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought it
was time we moved to a dedicated blog for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow others
in the team to write posts, and, it'll ensure that all the information on
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is now disseminated by specific channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this week, apart from the new blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662526&quot;&gt;neuron is in review&lt;/a&gt;
and should be approved this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-872277e166&quot;&gt;python-tvb-data&lt;/a&gt; is now in
testing, so we can begin working on the main software for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei&quot;&gt;The Virtual Brain
simulator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31/rpm-specs/tree/spm12&quot;&gt;SPM12 is now a WIP&lt;/a&gt;. It bundles
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip&quot;&gt;FieldTrip&lt;/a&gt;, so that will have to
be packaged first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/CNS-OIST/STEPS&quot;&gt;STEPS simulator&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31/rpm-specs/tree/steps&quot;&gt;WIP&lt;/a&gt;. It bundles a few
sources too, so they will have to be packaged first: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31/rpm-specs/tree/easyloggingpp&quot;&gt;easyloggingpp&lt;/a&gt;, and cvode
are two major ones that need to be unbundled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31/rpm-specs/tree/arbor&quot;&gt;Arbor simulator&lt;/a&gt; is also a WIP. I
ran into some trouble with CMake while trying to
build it, but community members on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UARN5KWBEMR22POWGDDF7WGCBAYT527X/&quot;&gt;devel list&lt;/a&gt;
were quite quick to point out the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to continue packaging software one by one. We currently have 140
tools on our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?tags=S%3A+Needs+packaging&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;,
so it'll take some time before all of them are available in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various visual impairments and abnormalities, such as unusual eye movement patterns, blink rates and retinal problems, are more common than usual in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, suggesting these issues may contribute to the development of the condition. Yet paradoxically, since the 1950s, there have also been intriguing hints that people who are blind from birth or an early age are &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; likely to develop schizophrenia and other kinds of psychoses, suggesting blindness can act as a protective factor against the illness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before now, findings – mostly from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246684/&quot;&gt;case-study type research&lt;/a&gt; – suggested that cortical blindness (resulting from abnormalities in the occipital cortex of the brain, rather than the eyes) may even be completely protective. As far as the authors of a new study are aware, not a single case of schizophrenia has ever been reported in someone who is cortically blind.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Note that most authors are cautious to add that ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’,” Vera Morgan at the University of Western Australia told me. But a total of zero documented cases among such people to date is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan is the lead author of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996418304055&quot;&gt;first large-scale population study investigating this phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Schizophrenia Research&lt;/i&gt;, and it provides further evidence that blindness really does reduce – or even eliminate – the risk of developing schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36154&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan and her colleagues used Western Australian state-wide registers to estimate the prevalence of cases of schizophrenia among people with congenital and early peripheral or cortical blindness. (“Early” was defined as starting before the age of six.) Cortical blindness can be inherited but it can also be caused by stroke-like events or brain trauma. Among the causes of peripheral blindness are glaucoma and congenital lens malformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were from a broader project to investigate risk factors for schizophrenia and related illnesses in a group of almost half a million people born in Western Australia between 1980 and 2001 (making them between 14 and 35 years old at the time of the analysis).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the entire sample, 9,120 had been diagnosed with some kind a psychotic illness (including schizophrenia), while 1,870 had a diagnosis of schizophrenia specifically. This latter figure is close to the 0.5 per cent prevalence rate in the wider population for people in this age range (given that some of the cohort were still children when the data was analysed, more cases of schizophrenia would be expected to emerge with time.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 66 cases of cortical blindness and 613 of peripheral blindness in the sample. Eight of the people with peripheral blindness had developed a psychotic illness, and just a few had developed schizophrenia. However, among the group with cortical blindness, the figure was zero.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the peripheral blindness group, this represents a lower-than-normal prevalence rate of 0.2 per cent, while for the cortical blindness group, it was obviously zero.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As congenital or early cortical blindness in particular is rare, even a total group size of almost half a million people might not be enough for clear conclusions about the impacts on schizophrenia risk to be drawn. But as the researchers write, the results do “lend confidence” to findings from previous studies that early blindness reduces the risk of a psychotic illness, and that early cortical blindness is apparently completely protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might explain this protective effect?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early blindness leads to clear enhancements in other areas of brain functioning – in sound perception, auditory attention, memory, language and the construction of subjective experience – all of which are often found not to be working well in people with schizophrenia, the researchers note. “It appears that early compensatory developmental neuroplasticity … creates advantages to blind people in the very functions that are impaired in schizophrenia,” they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might cortical rather than peripheral blindness be particularly protective?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blindness due to eye abnormalities does impact brain areas and pathways normally involved in vision. But the two types of blindness don’t affect the same structures. These differing impacts on connectivity between various brain regions may account for the extra protection afforded by cortical blindness – though quite how is not clear.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protective phenomenon now “warrants careful, clinical investigation,” the researchers write. Determining the underlying mechanisms will surely shed light on the complex causes of schizophrenia and – as they note – such work may also indicate targets for new early intervention or even prevention strategies, perhaps involving a focus on sensory perceptions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996418304055&quot;&gt;Congenital blindness is protective for schizophrenia and other psychotic illness. A whole-population study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most personality research is today conducted in the context of the Big Five model that describes personality according to people’s scores along five trait dimensions: Openness-to-Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. While these trait terms have very specific (though not necessarily completely settled) meanings in personality science, they also have their own meaning in everyday talk, which raises the question of whether, when a lay person says someone is extraverted, or conscientious, or whatever, they mean the same thing that psychologists mean when they measure and investigate those traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Judith Hall at Northeastern University and her colleagues compared lay volunteers’ conceptions of the Big Five traits with the way they are represented in four of the formal Big Five personality questionnaires that are used widely by researchers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618303787&quot;&gt;Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hall and her team said that their findings “not only provide a rich descriptive overview on laypeople’s understanding of the labels of some of the key constructs in personality science but also provided a relevant background for the application and development of assessment tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36125&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, Hall’s team provided nearly 250 online American participants (average age 35) with the following instruction: “If you would label someone you meet or know as [one of the Big Five traits was inserted here], what behaviours or personality characteristics would you think about in order to reach such a conclusion? List FIVE such behaviours or personality characteristics.” They were specifically asked not to consult a dictionary or any other reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers and separate teams of assistants then sifted repeatedly through all the behaviours and other characteristics that the participants in both studies cited for each Big Five trait and placed them into broader, superordinate categories (such as a “friendly/kind/compassionate” category or a “determined/hardworking/motivated” category and so on). For each main trait, they also looked to see if traits falling under certain categories of behaviour/characteristics were mentioned more often than others, which would be a sign that these categories were seen by lay people as more central or fundamental to the trait than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a high degree of consistency across the two online studies. And lay people’s conception of the Big Five traits overlapped with the scientific conception in some ways, but not in others. Some main points of difference highlighted by the researchers include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whereas the scientific conception of agreeableness includes being trusting, this was not mentioned by the lay participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the participants frequently described extraverted and conscientious people in terms of their kindness and compassion, but in the scientific personality questionnaires these attributes are not relevant to these traits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personality science sees impulsivity and self-consciousness as features of high neuroticism, but these attributes were not mentioned by lay participants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conversely, lay participants referred to the obsessive-compulsive tendencies of highly neurotic people, which is at odds with the formal personality measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences could be problematic whenever researchers, to save time or for other reasons, opt to ask lay participants about their own or other people’s personalities using only the Big Five trait terms (rather than using more detailed questionnaire items), such as by asking them to score themselves on the five traits – clearly the participants might interpret the meaning of the traits somewhat differently than the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feeds into another of the paper’s main take-aways – Hall and her colleagues say that apart from the simple intellectual value of their exercise, their findings could help inform the development of scientific questionnaires for measuring personality. For instance, test-developers could take into consideration lay people’s perception of the centrality of different behaviours to the main traits and then give extra weight to questionnaire items tapping those central categories of behaviour (to take one example, participants saw being outgoing and sociable as more central to extraversion than being talkative, or happy and funny). “It will be an empirical question how well such scales perform,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A heated political story in the United States last weekend perfectly illustrates how tribal politics can supercharge a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/20/5-reasons-its-so-hard-to-think-like-a-scientist/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;human weakness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that psychologists have been studying for some time – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;our deep-seated tendency to accept evidence that supports our existing beliefs, and to ignore evidence that contradicts them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; involved a conflict near the Lincoln Memorial featuring a handful of Black Israelites (a radical black nationalist group), a large group of mostly White American high-schoolers, some in Donald Trump hats, who were in town for an anti-abortion march, and a small group of Native American protesters, one of whom found himself in the midst of the high-schoolers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Following the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/20/outcry-after-kentucky-students-in-maga-hats-mock-native-american-veteran&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;initial reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of what happened, and spurred along by a short video and dramatic photos, suggesting that the teens had encircled and confronted the Native American protester in an apparent act of intimidation, there was widespread condemnation of the teenagers, calls for them to be suspended or expelled from school, doxxed, and so on. But what’s telling is that when new details emerged, most notably the emergence of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/blog/2019/01/20/covington-catholic-nathan-phillips-video&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;a longer video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; showing it was the protester who had waded into the sea of teens (because, he said later, he wanted to break up the conflict between them and the Black Israelites), and which complicated other aspects of the narrative as well, still many commentators continued to interpret events in line with their own political leanings. In fact the cacophonous online argument about what happened only seemed to explode in volume when the longer video was released — more information didn’t resolve things. At all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As the Georgetown University professor Jonathan Ladd &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonmladd/status/1087162673983295489&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;put it so well on Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: “Regarding the incident at the Lincoln Memorial,” he wrote, “it’s fascinating to see motivated reasoning play out in real time over a 24 hr period … Despite lots of video, all interpretations now match people’s partisanship.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These politically motivated cognitive gymnastics are the subject of an important new paper lead-authored by Anup Gampa and Sean P. Wojcik that’s just been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/hspjz&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;made available as a preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (and due to be published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Specifically, Gampa and Wojcik, working with a team that includes the open-science advocate Brian Nosek, decided to test the effects of politically motivated reasoning using logical syllogisms, a type of logical argument in which premises are assumed to be true, and arguments proceed from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36122&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The syllogism the researchers use as an example at the top of their paper nicely shows how this sort of thing works:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;All things made of plants are healthy. [premise]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Cigarettes are made of plants. [premise]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Therefore, cigarettes are healthy. [conclusion]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By the rules of logic and the conceit of logical syllogisms, this argument is logically sound (even if factually incorrect). But because “cigarettes are healthy” clangs loudly against people’s beliefs about the world, some people will reject this syllogism as false, even after having the logical rules of syllogisms explained to them. This example isn’t a particularly political issue — no one really thinks cigarettes are healthy at this point. What the researchers wanted to know was whether logically valid or invalid politicised syllogisms (pertaining to abortion, for instance) would be more likely to be misinterpreted as false or true, respectively, based on readers’ political beliefs, even though these beliefs should be irrelevant to interpreting the logical soundness of the syllogisms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a series of studies drawing on thousands of visitors to YourMorals.org and Project Implicit (the first two studies), and a nationally representative online sample of Americans (the third), Gampa and Wojcik asked a group of participants about their political beliefs and then presented them with a series of syllogisms designed to tap into either liberal or conservative sentiments, or no such sentiments at all — sometimes presented in traditional, formal syllogistic structure, and sometimes in more everyday language. The participants’ task was simply to determine which syllogisms were valid, and which were invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As prior research and theory on this subject would suggest, in the first study both liberals and conservatives were more likely to wrongly evaluate syllogisms whose conclusions’ clashed with their politics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers found a similar pattern in their second study, which dealt with arguments presented in more common language, and in a third drawing on a bigger, national American sample — though in that one “the effect was somewhat less pronounced[.]” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Summing things up, the researchers write, “participants evaluated the logical structure of entire arguments based on whether they believed in or agreed with the arguments’ conclusions. Although these effects were modest in magnitude, they were persistent: we observed these biases in evaluations of both classically-structured logical syllogisms and conversationally-framed political arguments, across a variety of polarised political issues, and in large Internet and nationally representative samples.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the furore over the recent events at the Lincoln Memorial illustrate, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;this is an interesting finding that is of course reflected constantly, albeit in a different and more nuanced form, in the real world: People &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;routinely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; dismiss perfectly sound arguments that would cause them cognitive discomfort by threatening their political beliefs, or their sense of themselves as members in good standing within their political tribe, and so on. As a general rule, the more political and emotional and social ties we have to an idea — the more an idea &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, in a deep way, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;to our sense of ourselves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; — the less likely we’ll be to let it go even in the face of strong evidence it is false.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This study can’t contribute to the debate over whether liberals or conservatives are more likely to commit such errors, the researchers write, because the stimuli weren’t constructed to be equally polarising to the two “sides” (though some prior research suggest both tribes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;equally vulnerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). It also doesn’t tell us what can be done about this sort of ill-formed reasoning. Though on that front, at least, Gampa, Wojcik, and their colleagues do have some ideas: “A takeaway from this research… may be that reasoners should strive to be epistemologically humble. If logical reasoning is to serve as the antidote to the poison of partisan gridlock, we must begin by acknowledging that it does not merely serve our objectivity, but also our biases.” That is, people should dispense themselves of the notion that when they sit down to reason a problem through carefully, the act of doing so automatically shields them from the effects of political bias. Because bias isn’t a problem endemic to any one political movement: It’s a problem endemic to having a human brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Julia Goncharenko's journal club session, where she will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3950.pdf&quot;&gt;Microcircuits and their interactions in epilepsy, is the focus out of focus? (Jeanne Paz and John Huguenard, 2015)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epileptic seizures represent dysfunctional neural networks dominated by excessive and/or hypersynchronous activity. Recent progress in the field has outlined two concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as ‘primary generalized’ epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes. We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition. Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, focusing on circuit ‘choke points’ remote from the initiation site might be as important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure ‘focus’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to meet your friend at a cafe you’re confident about sticking to your resolutions for healthier living. It soon goes awry though – no, not because of your weak willpower, but due to your excess empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend orders first and plumps for the super indulgent Winter Warmer Chocca Mocha with added marshmallows. You follow suit, sensing that if you’d stuck with your original plans for a skinny coffee, you’d have made your friend feel awful. There is now a name for this behaviour: You just engaged in “altruistic indulgence”, the most appealing of excuses for a naughty lapse, described for the first time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2018.1546616&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Influence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36109&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youjae.com/english/profile.html&quot;&gt;Youjae Yi&lt;/a&gt; at Seoul National University first conducted a field study at a university cafe. They obtained the till receipts for 649 transactions and looked to see whether customers had ordered a low-calorie or high-calorie coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half the lone customers ordered a healthy option and half opted for high calorie. Similarly, among the customers who were in a pair and who had ordered first, there was again roughly a 50/50 split in choosing healthy or unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In striking contrast, among customers who ordered second, their rate of ordering unhealthy leapt to 80 per cent if their companion had ordered a high-calorie drink (conversely, if the first-ordering companion plumped for a healthy drink, the rate of choosing healthy among those choosing second was only 60 per cent, which is statistically not a significant difference from the average rate of choosing healthy among lone customers or first-order customers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put differently, when following a companion who made an unhealthy order, the average rate of choosing unhealthy among customers choosing second increased by 33 per cent; in contrast, when following a companion who made a healthy order, the average rate of choosing healthy among customers choosing second increased by just 8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The modelling behaviour for unhealthy choices was much stronger than that for healthy choices,” the researchers said, adding that this result is consistent with their theory that if our companion orders an unhealthy option, we are often motivated to copy them so as to avoid making them feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea further, Yi and his team conducted an online experiment in which they asked 174 women in the US to imagine meeting a friend or a rival at a burger bar and that their companion had ordered first and had chosen the more indulgent, higher-calorie burger of the two on offer. Next, the participants were asked to say which kind of burger meal they would order – the healthier or the more indulgent. The researchers reasoned that if altruistic indulgence is a real phenomenon then participants would be more likely to choose the unhealthy option if they were dining with a friend (based on the logic that you are more likely to feel altruistic concern for a friend than a rival).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants asked to imagine dining with a friend were indeed more likely to follow their companion’s lead and opt for the high-calorie burger (51 per cent chose this option, compared with 29 per cent in the rival condition). Moreover, the researchers asked the participants about the motives influencing their choice – concern for their companion’s feelings or a desire to be liked and accepted.  In statistical terms, the higher rate of choosing the unhealthy burger in the friend scenario was entirely explained by the participants in this condition (compared with the rival condition) being more motivated by concern for their companion’s feelings, not by any greater desire to be liked or accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically indulgence is regarded as an egoistic choice associated with short-term pleasure for the self and engaged via loss of self-control,” the researchers said. “However, we show that altruistic indulgence is associated with self-sacrifice (forgoing one’s preference and health) … [as a way to protect the feelings of one’s companion].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yi and his team said future studies could look into the circumstances that might increase or decrease altruistic indulgence (they predicted that it might be greater when dining with a heavier companion who chooses an unhealthy food or drink option, “… because people should believe that a healthy choice will make a heavier individual feel particularly guilty”) and studies could also investigate how people feel after engaging in altruistic indulgence – will they feel happy that they protected their friend’s feelings or bad that they ate or drank unhealthily?&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Neurocritic: What Can Brain Imaging Tell Us About Violent Extremism?</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5sw_bDOsc7k/XEY-RzPS_EI/AAAAAAAAMuE/EqoMorjO-SQCcUpautX4v2YgG2Qih-qZACLcBGAs/s1600/Will%2Bto%2Bfight%2Band%2Bdie.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;586&quot; data-original-width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5sw_bDOsc7k/XEY-RzPS_EI/AAAAAAAAMuE/EqoMorjO-SQCcUpautX4v2YgG2Qih-qZACLcBGAs/s320/Will%2Bto%2Bfight%2Band%2Bdie.png&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before answering that question, I'll tell you about an incredibly impressive ethnographic study and field survey. For a one year period, the investigators (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) conducted field work within the community of  young Moroccan men in Barcelona, Spain. As the authors explain, the Moroccan diaspora is an immigrant community susceptible to jihadist forms of radicalization:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Spain hosts Europe’s second largest Moroccan diaspora community (after France) and its least integrated, whereas Catalonia hosts the largest and least integrated Moroccan community in Spain. Barcelona ... was most recently the site of a mass killing ... by a group of young Moroccan men pledging support for the Islamic State. According to a recent Europol’s latest annual report on terrorism trends, Spain had the second highest number of jihadist terrorism-related arrests in Europe (second only to France) in 2016...  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of observation in selected neighborhoods, the researchers approached prospective participants about completing a survey, with the assurance of absolute anonymity. No names were exchanged, and informed consent procedures were performed orally, to prevent any written record of participation. The very large sample included 535 respondents (average age 23.47 years, range 18–42), who were all Sunni Muslim Moroccan men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of the study was to look at &lt;i&gt;sacred values&lt;/i&gt; in these participants, and whether these values might affect their willingness to engage in violent extremism. “Sacred values are immune or resistant to material tradeoffs and are associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, not on the consequences of the action&quot;&gt;deontic&lt;/a&gt; (duty-bound) reasoning...” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). The term &lt;i&gt;sacred values&lt;/i&gt; doesn't necessarily refer to religious beliefs. One of the most common is the basic human value, “it is wrong to kill another human being.” But theoretically speaking, we could include statements such as, “it is wrong to kill endangered species &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alternet.org/2015/07/6-rich-white-people-who-get-killing-wild-african-animals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;for sport&lt;/a&gt; (or for any other reason).” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this study, &lt;u&gt;Sacred Values&lt;/u&gt; included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Palestinian right of return&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Western military forces being expelled from all Muslim lands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strict sharia as the rule of law in all Muslim countries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Armed jihad being waged against enemies of Muslims&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forbidding of caricatures of Prophet Mohammed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Veiling of women in public&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were the &lt;u&gt;Nonsacred Values&lt;/u&gt;? We don't know. I couldn't find examples anywhere in the paper. It's crucial that we know what these were, to help understand the “sacralization” of nonsacred values, which was observed in an fMRI experiment (described later). So I turned to the Supplemental Material of &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0262&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The price of your soul: neural evidence for the non-utilitarian representation of sacred values&quot;&gt;Berns et al. (2012)&lt;/a&gt;, inferring that the statements below are good examples of nonsacred values in a population of adults in Atlanta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a dog person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a cat person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a Pepsi drinker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a Coke drinker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You believe that Target is superior to Walmart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You believe that Walmart is superior to Target.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if the nonsacred values in the present study of violent extremism were a little more contentious and meaningful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a fan of FC Barcelona.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a fan of AC Milan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to choose participants for the fMRI experiment, the investigators first divided the entire group into those who were more (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=267) or less (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=268)  vulnerable to recruitment into violent extremism (see &lt;b&gt;Appendix &lt;/b&gt;for details).  An important comparison would have been to directly contrast brain  activity in these two groups, but that wasn't done here. Out of the 267 men more vulnerable to violent extremism, 38 agreed to participate in the fMRI study. These 38 were more likely to Endorse Militant Jihadism (score 4.24 out of 7) than the general fMRI pool (3.35) and the non-fMRI pool (2.43).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A battery of six sacred and six nonsacred values was constructed individually for  each person and presented in the scanner, along with a number of grammatical variants, for a list of 50 different items per condition. The 38 participants were randomly assigned to one of two manipulations in a between-subjects design: exclusion (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=19) and inclusion (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=19) in the ever-popular ball-tossing video game of &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03192765&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cyberball&lt;/a&gt;. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03192765.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nujcfnjo5cE/XEZbr7oP9iI/AAAAAAAAMuc/Y1CQ_Go_cF8J66NU-n1LbGHiD9EkrTSOwCLcBGAs/s1600/Study%2Bdesign_Cyberball%2Band%2Bviolent%2Bextremism.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;879&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nujcfnjo5cE/XEZbr7oP9iI/AAAAAAAAMuc/Y1CQ_Go_cF8J66NU-n1LbGHiD9EkrTSOwCLcBGAs/s400/Study%2Bdesign_Cyberball%2Band%2Bviolent%2Bextremism.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this reduced the study's statistical power. Nonetheless, a major goal of the experiment was to examine how social exclusion affects the processing of sacred values. I don't know if Cyberball studies are ever conducted in a within-subjects design (perhaps with an intervening task), or if exposure to one of the two conditions is too “contaminating”. At any rate, in real life, discrimination against Muslim immigrants is isolating and causes exclusion from social and economic benefits. Feelings of marginalization can result in  greater radicalization and support for (and participation in) extremist groups. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;At this point in time, I don't think neuroimaging can add to the extensive knowledge gained from years of field work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the investigators wanted to extend the findings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0262&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berns et al. (2012)&lt;/a&gt; to a very different population. The earlier study wanted to determine whether sacred values are processed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deontological&lt;/a&gt; way (based on strict rules of right and wrong) or in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;utilitarian&lt;/a&gt; fashion (based on cost/benefit analysis of outcome). As interpreted by those authors, processing sacred values was associated with increased activation of left  temporoparietal junction (semantic storage) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (semantic retrieval). Berns et al. suggested that “sacred values affect behaviour through the retrieval and processing of  deontic rules and not through a utilitarian evaluation of costs and  benefits.” Based on those results, the obvious prediction in the present study is that sacred values should activate left  temporoparietal junction (L TPJ) and  left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (L VLPFC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A1jhG0SOzHc/XEaKsppMMzI/AAAAAAAAMuo/20pS-D2IsWIkKT2l56RrwtJ17ileOia3gCLcBGAs/s1600/Sacred%2Bvs.%2BNonsacred.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;369&quot; data-original-width=&quot;681&quot; height=&quot;173&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A1jhG0SOzHc/XEaKsppMMzI/AAAAAAAAMuo/20pS-D2IsWIkKT2l56RrwtJ17ileOia3gCLcBGAs/s320/Sacred%2Bvs.%2BNonsacred.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig. 3A (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fig. 3A shows that only the latter half of that prediction was observed, and there was no explanation for the lack of activation in L TPJ. Instead, there was a finding in R TPJ in the excluded group which I won't discuss further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, the excluded participants rated themselves as being more likely to fight and die for &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;nonsacred&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; values, compared to the included participants. This was termed “sacralization” and now you can see why it's so important to know the nonsacred values. Are we talking about fighting and dying for Pepsi vs. Coke? For FC Barcelona vs. AC Milan? Not to be glib, but this would help us understand why social exclusion (in an artificial experimental setting) would radicalize these participants (in an artificial experimental setting).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuSJTqUYEBs/XEaPgNS9n3I/AAAAAAAAMu0/pZvyF0z1CoQCo0WhpYzCkSm1_PN6ykmSwCLcBGAs/s1600/LIFG%2Bincluded%2Bvs.%2Bexcluded.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;374&quot; data-original-width=&quot;747&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuSJTqUYEBs/XEaPgNS9n3I/AAAAAAAAMu0/pZvyF0z1CoQCo0WhpYzCkSm1_PN6ykmSwCLcBGAs/s400/LIFG%2Bincluded%2Bvs.%2Bexcluded.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig. 3B (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span&gt;Nonsacred values activate Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, aka VLPFC) in the excluded group, but not in the included group. This was interpreted as a neural correlate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“sacralization”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interpretation of Fig. 3B is that the exclusion manipulation was distracting, making it more difficult for these participants to process stimuli expressing nonsacred values (due to increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709652&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;encoding demands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17924553&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;syntactic processing&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Exclusion increased emotional intensity ratings, and decreased feelings of belongingness and being in control. This distraction could have carried over to the task of rating one's willingness to fight and die in defense of values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if we say the brain imaging results weren't especially informative, the extensive ethnographic study and field surveys were a highly valuable source of data on a marginalized group of young Muslim men at risk of recruitment by violent extremist groups. It's a vicious cycle: terrorist attacks result in greater discrimination and persecution of innocent Muslim men, which has the unintended effect of further radicalization in some of the most vulnerable individuals. To conclude, I acknowledge that my comments may be out of turn because I have no authority or expertise, and because I'm from a country with an appalling record of discriminating against Muslims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I was a bit confused by some of these scores, because they changed from one paragraph to the next, and differed from what was in Table 1.

	<description>Nerd Food: Tooling in Computational Neuroscience - Part II: Microscopy&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;verse&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wernher von Braun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second instalment of our second series on Computational Neuroscience for lay people. You can find the first post of the previous series &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the first post of the current series &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/nerd-food-tooling-in-computational.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As you'd expect, this second series is slightly more advanced, and, as such, it is peppered with unavoidable technical jargon. Having said that, we shall continue to pursue our ambitious target of making things as easy to parse as possible (but no easier). If you read the first series, the second should hopefully make some sense.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1&quot; id=&quot;fnr.1&quot; name=&quot;fnr.1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/nerd-food-tooling-in-computational.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience&quot;&gt;Computational Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; as a discipline, and the kind of things one may want to do in this field. We also spoke about models and their composition, and the desirable properties of a platform that runs simulations of said models. However, it occurred to me that we should probably build some kind of &quot;end-to-end&quot; understanding; that is, by starting with the simulations and models we are missing a vital link with the physical (i.e. non-computational) world. To put matters right, this part attempts to provide a high-level introduction on how data is acquired from the real world and can then be used - amongst other things - to inform the modeling process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Macro and Micro Microworlds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post, the data gathering process starts with the microscope. Of course, keep in mind that we are focusing only on the &lt;i&gt;morphology&lt;/i&gt; at present - the shape and the structures that make up the neuron - so we are ignoring other important activities in the lab. For instance, one can conduct experiments to measure voltage in a neuron, and these measurements provide data for the functional aspects of the model. Alas, we will skip these for now, with the promise of returning to them at a later date&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2&quot; id=&quot;fnr.2&quot; name=&quot;fnr.2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, microscopes then. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy&quot;&gt;Microscopy&lt;/a&gt; is the technical name for the observation work done with the microscope. Because neurons are so small - some 4 to 100 microns in size - only certain types of microscopes are suitable to perform neuronal microscopy. To make matters worse, the sub-structures inside the neuron are an important area of study and they can be ridiculously small: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine&quot;&gt;dentritic spine&lt;/a&gt; - the minute protrusions that come out of the dendrites - can be as tiny as 500 nanometres; the lipid bylayer itself is only 2 or 3 nanometres thick, so you can imagine how incredibly small ion channels and pumps are. Yet these are some of the things we want to observe and measure. Lets call this the &quot;micro&quot; work. On the other hand, we also want to understand connectivity and other larger structures, as well as perform observations of the evolution of the cell and so on. Lets call this the &quot;macro&quot; work. These are not technical terms, by the by, just so we can orient ourselves. So, how does one go about observing these differently sized microworlds? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;F1.large.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/39/16877/F1.large.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/span&gt; Example of measurements one may want to perform on a dendrite.

As it was with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope&quot;&gt;Van Leeuwenhoek's&lt;/a&gt; tool in the sixteen hundreds, so it is that today's optical microscopes still rely on light and lenses to perform observations. Needless to say, things did evolve a fair bit since then, but standard optical microscopy has not completely removed the shackles of its limitations. These are of three kinds, as Wikipedia helpfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Optical_microscopy&quot;&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt;: a) the objects we want to observe must be dark or strongly refracting - a problem, since the internal structures of the cell are transparent; b) visible light's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system&quot;&gt;diffraction limit&lt;/a&gt; means that we cannot go much lower than 200 nanometres - pretty impressive, but unfortunately not quite low enough for detailed sub-structure analysis; and c) out of focus light hampers image clarity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workarounds to these limitations have been found in the guise of &lt;i&gt;techniques&lt;/i&gt;, with the aim of augmenting the abilities of standard optical microscopy. There are many of these techniques. There is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy&quot;&gt;Confocal Microscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3&quot; id=&quot;fnr.3&quot; name=&quot;fnr.3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - improving resolution and contrast; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope&quot;&gt;Fluorescence microscope&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Sub-diffraction_techniques&quot;&gt;sub-diffraction technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;to reconstruct some of the detail that is missing due to diffraction; or the incredible-looking movies produced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/journey-through-the-brain-multiphoton-microscopy/&quot;&gt;Multiphoton Microscopy&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, it is possible to combine multiple techniques in a single microscope, as is the case with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphoton_fluorescence_microscope&quot;&gt;Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscopes&lt;/a&gt; (MTMs) and many others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, given all of these developments, it seems there is no sign of optical microscopy dying out. Presumably some of this is due to the relative lower cost of this approach as well as to the ease of use. In addition, optical microscopy is complementary to the other more expensive types of microscopes; it is the perfect tool for &quot;macro&quot; work that can then help to point out where to do &quot;micro&quot; work. For example, you can use an optical microscope to assess the larger structures and see how they evolve over time, and eventually decide on specific areas that require more detailed analysis. And when you do, you need a &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; different kind of microscope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Electron Microscopy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; high-resolution, there is only one tool to turn to: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope&quot;&gt;Electron Microscope (EM)&lt;/a&gt;. This crazy critter can provide &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; levels of magnification by using a beam of electrons instead of visible light. Just how insane, you ask? Well, if you think that an optical microscope lives in the range of 1500x to 2000x - that is, can magnify a sample up to two thousand times - an EM can magnify as much as 10 &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;million times&lt;/span&gt;, and provide a sub-nanometre resolution&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4&quot; id=&quot;fnr.4&quot; name=&quot;fnr.4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is mind boggling. If fact, we've already seen images of atoms using EM in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_31.html&quot;&gt;part II&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps it wasn't easy to appreciate just how amazing a feat that is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, EM is itself a family - and a large one at that, with many and diverse members. As with optical microscopy, each member of the family specialises on a given technique or combination of techniques. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope&quot;&gt;Scanning Electron Microscope&lt;/a&gt; (SEM) performs a scan of the object under study, and has a resolution of 1 nanometre or higher; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_confocal_electron_microscopy&quot;&gt;Scanning Confocal Electron Microscope (SCEM)&lt;/a&gt;uses the same confocal technique mentioned above to provide higher depth resolution; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy&quot;&gt;Transmission Electron Microscopy&lt;/a&gt; (TEM) has the ability to penetrate inside the specimen during the imagining process, given samples with thickness of 100 nanometres or less. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple of noteworthy points are required at this juncture. First, whilst some of these EM techniques may sound new and exciting, most have been around for a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; long time; it just seems they keep getting better and better as they mature. For example, TEM was used in the fifties to show that neurons communicate over synaptic junctions but its still wildly popular today. Secondly, its important to understand that the entire imaging process is not at all trivial - certainly not for TEM, nor EM in general and probably not for Optical Microscopy either. It just is a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; labour intensive and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt;specialised process - most likely done by an expert human neuroanatomist - and the difficulties range from the chemical preparation of the samples all the way up to creating the images. The end product may give the impression it was easy to produce, but easy it was not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At any rate, whatever the technical details, the fact is that the imagery that results from all these advances is truly evocative - haunting, even. Take this image produced by SEM: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2014_06_26_human_ipsc_derived_neuron_deerinck.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/news_uploads/2014_06_26_human_ipsc_derived_neuron_deerinck.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/span&gt; Human neuron. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/new_reprogramming_method_makes_better_stem_cells&quot;&gt;Source: New Reprogramming Method Makes Better Stem Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is incredibly beautiful; simultaneously awe-inspiring and depressing because it really conveys the messiness and complexity of wetware. By way of contrast, look at the neatness of man-made micro-structures: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bluegeneq%20x%20420.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;http://m.eet.com/media/1118299/bluegeneq%20x%20420.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/span&gt; The BlueGene/Q chip.

As you can see in the neuron micrograph, these images provide a great visual description of the topology of the object we are trying to study. You also may notice a slight coloration of the cell in that picture. This is most likely due to the fact that the people doing the analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining&quot;&gt;stain&lt;/a&gt; the neuron to make it easier to image. Now, in practice - at least as far as I have seen, which is not very far at all, to be fair - 2D grayscale images are preferred by researchers to the nice, Public Relations friendly pictures like the one above; those appear to be more useful for magazine covers. The working micrographs are not quite as exciting to the untrained eye but very useful to the professionals. Here's an example: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fetch.php?w=900&amp;amp;tok=d88a10&amp;amp;media=wiki:biomed-neurons.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.leet.it/home/giusti/website/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=900&amp;amp;tok=d88a10&amp;amp;media=wiki:biomed-neurons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/span&gt; The left-hand side shows the original micrograph. On the right-hand side it shows the result of processing it with machine learning. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4741-deep-neural-networks-segment-neuronal-membranes-in-electron-microscopy-images.pdf&quot;&gt;Deep Neural Networks Segment Neuronal Membranes in Electron Microscopy Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's focus on the left-hand side of this image for the moment. It was taken using &lt;i&gt;ssTEM&lt;/i&gt; - serial-section TEM, an evolutionary step in TEM. The &lt;i&gt;ss&lt;/i&gt; part of ssTEM is helpful in creating &lt;i&gt;stacks&lt;/i&gt; of images, which is why you see the little drawings on the left of the picture; they are there to give you the idea that the top-most image is one of 30 in a stack&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5&quot; id=&quot;fnr.5&quot; name=&quot;fnr.5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The process of producing the images above was as follows: they started off with a neuronal tissue sample, which is prepared for observation. The sample had 1.5 micrometres and was then sectioned into 30 slices of 50 nanometres. Each of these slices was imaged, at a resolution of 4x4 nanometres per pixel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this work is extremely sensitive to measurement error. The trick is to ensure there is some kind of visual continuity between images so that you can recreate a 3D model from the 2D slices. This means for instance that if you are trying to figure out connectivity, you need some way to relate a dendrite to it's soma and say to the axon of the neuron it connects to - and that's one of the reasons why the slices have to be so thin. It would be no good if the pictures miss this information out as you will not be able to recreate the connectivity faithfully. This is actually really difficult to achieve in practice due to the minute sizes involved; a slight tremor that displaces the sample by some nanometres would cause shifts in alignment; even with the high-precision the tools have, you can imagine that there is always some kind of movement in the sample's position as part of the slicing process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Images in a stack are normally stored using traditional formats such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format&quot;&gt;TIFF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6&quot; id=&quot;fnr.6&quot; name=&quot;fnr.6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can see an example of the raw images in a stack &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/unidesigner/groundtruth-drosophila-vnc/tree/master/stack2/raw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Its worth noticing that, even though the images are 2D grey-scale, since the pixel size is only a few nanometres wide (4x4 in this case), the full size of an image is very large. Indeed, the latest generation of microscopes produce stacks on the 500 Terabyte range, making the processing of the images a &quot;big-data&quot; challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-5&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;What To Do Once You Got the Images&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back to the task at hand. Once you have the stack, the next logical step is to try to figure out what's what: which objects are in the picture. This is called segmentation and labelling, presumably because you are breaking the one big monolithic picture into discrete objects and give them names. Historically, segmentation has been done manually, but its a painful, slow and error-prone process. Due to this, there is a lot of interest in automation, and it has recently become feasible to do so - what with the abundance of cheap computing resources as well as the advent of &quot;useful&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; (rather than the theoretical variety). Cracking this puzzle is gaining traction amongst the programming herds, as you can see by the popularity of challenges such as this one: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiji.sc/Segmentation_of_neuronal_structures_in_EM_stacks_challenge_-_ISBI_2012&quot;&gt;Segmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks challenge - ISBI 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It is from this challenge we sourced the stack and micrograph above; the right-hand side is the finished product after machine learning processing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also open source packages to help with segmentation. A couple of notable contenders are &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiji.sc/Fiji&quot;&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ilastik.org/&quot;&gt;Ilastik&lt;/a&gt;. Below is a screenshot of Ilastik. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Figure-2-a.png&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilastik/ilastik.github.io/master/gallery/Figure-2-a.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/span&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ilastik.org/gallery.html&quot;&gt;Ilastik gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An activity that naturally follows on from segmentation and labelling is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_tracing&quot;&gt;reconstruction&lt;/a&gt;. The objective of reconstruction is to try to &quot;reconstruct&quot; morphology given the images in the stack. It could involve inferring the missing bits of information by mathematical means or any other kind of analysis which transforms the set of discrete objects spotted by segmentation into something looking more like a bunch of connected neurons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once we have a reconstructed model, we can start performing &lt;i&gt;morphometric analysis&lt;/i&gt;. As wikipedia tells us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics&quot;&gt;Morphometry&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;the quantitative analysis of form&quot;; as you can imagine, there are a lot of useful things one may want to measure in the brain structures and sub-structures such as lengths, volumes, surface area and so on. Some of these measurements can of course be done in 2D, but life is made easier if the model is available in 3D. One such tool is &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Neuro_tool&quot;&gt;NeuroMorph&lt;/a&gt;. It is an open source extension written in Python for the popular open source 3D computer graphics software &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)&quot;&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroMorph_screenshot.png&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;https://en.blender.org/uploads/9/98/NeuroMorph_screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 6:&lt;/span&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://figshare.com/articles/Segmented_anisotropic_ssTEM_dataset_of_neural_tissue/856713&quot;&gt;Segmented anisotropic ssTEM dataset of neural tissue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-6&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-6&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit of a world-wind tour of some of the sources of real world data for Computational Neuroscience. As I soon found out, each of these sections could have easily been ten times bigger and still not provide you with a proper overview of the landscape; having said that, I hope that the post at least gives some impression of the terrain and its main features. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a software engineering perspective, its worth pointing out the lack of standardisation in information exchange. In an ideal world, one would want a pipeline with components to perform each of the steps of the complete process, from data acquisition off of a microscope (either opitical or EM), to segmentation, labelling, reconstruction and finally morphometric analysis. This would then be used as an input to the models. Alas, no such overarching standard appears to exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One final point in terms of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). On one hand, it is encouraging to see the large number of FOSS tools and programs being used. Unfortunately - at least for the lovers of Free Software - there are also some proprietary tools that are widely used such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida&quot;&gt;NeuroLucida&lt;/a&gt;. Since the software is so specialised, the fear is that in the future, the better funded commercial enterprises will take over more and more of the space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's all for now. Don't forget to tune in for the next instalment! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;text-footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.1&quot; id=&quot;fn.1&quot; name=&quot;fn.1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;As it happens, what we are doing here is to apply a well-established learning methodology called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/&quot;&gt;Feynman Technique&lt;/a&gt;. I was blissfully unaware of its existence all this time, even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman&quot;&gt;Feynman&lt;/a&gt; is one of my heroes and even though I had read a fair bit about the man. On this topic (and the reason why I came to know about the Feynman Technique), its worth reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/01/richard-feynman-knowing-something/&quot;&gt;Richard Feynman: The Difference Between Knowing the Name of Something and Knowing Something&lt;/a&gt;, where Feynman discusses his disappointment with science education in Brazil. Unfortunately the Portuguese and the Brazilian teaching systems have a lot in common - or at least they did when I was younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.2&quot; id=&quot;fn.2&quot; name=&quot;fn.2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;Nor is the microscope the only way to figure out what is happening inside the brain. For example, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging&quot;&gt;neuroimagining&lt;/a&gt; techniques which can provide data about both structure and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.3&quot; id=&quot;fn.3&quot; name=&quot;fn.3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;Patented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky&quot;&gt;Marvin Minsky&lt;/a&gt;, no less - yes, he of Computer Science and AI fame! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.4&quot; id=&quot;fn.4&quot; name=&quot;fn.4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;And, to be fair, sub-nanometre just doesn't quite capture just how low these things can go. For an example, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21844593&quot;&gt;Electron microscopy at a sub-50 pm resolution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.5&quot; id=&quot;fn.5&quot; name=&quot;fn.5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;For a more technical but yet short and understandable take, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/47/12101.full&quot;&gt;Uniform Serial Sectioning for Transmission Electron Microscopy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footdef&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnum&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fnr.6&quot; id=&quot;fn.6&quot; name=&quot;fn.6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;footpara&quot;&gt;On the topic of formats: its probably time we mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site&quot;&gt;Open Microscopy Environment&lt;/a&gt; (OME). The microscopy world is dominated by hardware and as such its the perfect environment for corporations, their proprietary formats and expensive software packages. The OME guys are trying to buck the trend by creating a suite of open source tools and protocols, and by looking at some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.openmicroscopy.org/viewing-data.html#screen&quot;&gt;their stuff&lt;/a&gt;, they seem to be doing alright. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2015-11-30 Mon 23:12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 24.5.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Teenagers’ Lack Of Insight Into Some Of Their Abilities Has Implications For Career Counselling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=36049</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/21/teenagers-lack-of-insight-into-some-of-their-abilities-has-implications-for-career-counselling/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much insight do you have into your own mental and emotional abilities, such as verbal intelligence, spatial cognition and interpersonal skills? Might your friends have a better idea of your strengths and weaknesses than you do? In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018330135&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Heliyon&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://aljoscha-neubauer.com&quot;&gt;Aljoscha Neubauer&lt;/a&gt; explain that while such questions of self- vs. other-insight have already been looked at in the context of the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160613-why-you-can-never-tell-what-your-friends-really-think-of-you&quot;&gt;personality traits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053708&quot;&gt;general IQ&lt;/a&gt;, theirs is the first investigation in the context of more specific abilities. It’s an important issue for young people, they add, since choosing career paths that play to our abilities can increase the chances of later success – but it remains an open question whether and for which abilities people should rely on their own judgments or seek the advice of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36049&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 233 participants in their mid-teens (average age 14) and 215 participants in their late teens (average age 18). Participants completed six tests, including: established measures of their verbal, numerical and spatial abilities; a test of divergent creativity (thinking up novel uses for an umbrella, plastic bottle and shoe); and a questionnaire tapping their intra- and interpersonal emotional management (based on the participants’ selection of the best way to deal with various social and emotional scenarios).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after completing the tests, the participants filled out an additional questionnaire asking them to reflect on and estimate their own abilities in the various domains that had been tested. Finally, they also completed the same questionnaire in relation to the abilities of one or more of their school classmates (such that each participant rated themselves and was also rated by two of their classmates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were very poor at judging their own verbal ability and their judgments of their peers’ verbal abilities were not much better – a result that the researchers described as their “most puzzling”, considering you’d think such abilities would be apparent both to oneself and one’s peers, especially in a school context. One possible explanation is that the teenagers’ conception of verbal intelligence “might not correspond” with the researchers’ conception and the way it was tested; another explanation, the researchers suggested, is that the participants verbal IQ was perhaps rather low and “individuals of lower verbal ability might be particularly weak at self- and peer estimating because this might require exactly what they are missing: a good verbal ability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast with verbal intelligence, participants had some accurate insight into their own creativity, and even more insight into the creativity of their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for spatial ability an age difference emerged. At age 14, as with verbal ability, participants were poor at judging their own and each other’s spatial ability. By age 18, by contrast, participants had some accuracy at judging their own spatial abilities, but not their peers’ abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relation to interpersonal competence, the participants had a degree of insight into their own abilities, but not each other’s (perhaps because they simply scored how much they liked the person they were rating rather than offering an unbiased estimate of their social and emotional skills). One detail here is that their ability to estimate their peers’ interpersonal skills increased “considerably” at age 18, compared with 14, albeit that this accuracy was still relatively poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the researchers expected, the participants’ were able to estimate their own intra-personal abilities with some accuracy, but not the intra-personal abilities of their peers (presumably because our inner emotional worlds are hidden to an extent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neubauer and his colleagues said their findings have “important practical implications”, particularly in the context of young people choosing their career paths. While they acknowledged their findings need replicating, they suggested that for some domains, especially verbal IQ, young people appear to have surprising ignorance of their own ability (or lack of ability). Even for those abilities where participants had more insight (into themselves and their peers), it’s worth noting that this was relatively modest, with their judgments accounting for only between 15 and 20 per cent of the variance in ability between participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could test other age groups, and look at the judgments made by other informants besides participants’ peers, such as family members, to see if they would have greater insight into participants’ abilities. (The current study included a measure of friendship closeness but found no evidence that this affected the participants’ accuracy in judging their peers’ abilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that “As young people might have biased views of their own but also of their peers’ abilities, scientifically based career counselling should include not only tests for interests but also performance tests to avoid erroneous vocational decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>There's been an interesting discussion on Twitter about senior scientists who pressure their students or postdocs into scientific misconduct or otherwise poor science:

Bullying students into providing the &quot;right&quot; results: research misconduct by proxy?
This is probably among the worst but receives little attention

— Simon Eickhoff (@INM7_ISN) January 19, 2019
Today, I was made aware of a site called Bullied Into Bad Science which aims to tackle this problem.
