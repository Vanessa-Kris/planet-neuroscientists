	<description>Retraction Watch readers may have noticed what seems like a growing trend: Co-first authorships. While the move might seem like a way to promote equality, some researchers are worried that it’s having the opposite effect. In response, the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) recently created additional requirements for shared first authorship. We asked Arturo Casadevall, … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;http://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/16/sharing-the-coin-of-the-realm-how-one-journal-hopes-new-authorship-rules-will-cut-down-on-bias/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Sharing the coin of the realm: How one journal hopes new authorship rules will cut down on bias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that science has a diversity problem, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/women-science&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/blacks-in-stem-jobs-are-especially-concerned-about-diversity-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/&quot;&gt;members of minority groups&lt;/a&gt; being underrepresented. A new study suggests a solution aimed at children – reframing science as something that people do, rather than something that defines their identity, can reduce the potentially off-putting impact of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.21231&quot;&gt;“white male” scientist stereotype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12837&quot;&gt;published recently in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thoughtful use of language encourages greater interest in science among young children – and makes them less likely to lose confidence in their scientific abilities as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37148&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Lei and colleagues recruited 212 children in 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; grade (about 7-9 years old) at two diverse publicly funded schools in New York City. The kids were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group always received “identity-focused” language about science (that implied that&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;scientists are a specific category of people), while the other always received “action-focused” language (that implied science is an activity that anyone can do).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the beginning of the study the kids saw a video that introduced them to the scientific process. For the identity-focused group, the narrator of the video used phrases like “scientists make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”. The action-focused group, on the other hand, heard language like “when people do science, they make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At three points across the academic year, the children answered questions measuring their attitudes towards science, including their levels of interest (either how much they wanted to “be a scientist” or “do science”, depending on the group they were in), and how good they thought they’d be (either at “being a scientist” or “doing science”). At the second and third testing points, they were also asked to judge how many parents of other children at school “were scientists” or “did science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the children in the action-focused group had a greater interest in “doing science” than those in the identity-focussed group had in “being a scientist”. The action-focused group also rated themselves higher in their scientific abilities, and they thought that more adults “did science” compared with how many people the identity group thought “were scientists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the year, as the children got older, their interest in science and belief in their own abilities decreased. But the kind of language they had received was important: children in the action-focused group didn’t show a decrease in self-belief, unlike the children in the identity-focused group. In part, this effect seemed to be because the action group believed more adults in their community were doing science. “The benefit of action‐focused language partly occurred because children have more inclusive representations of who they think can ‘do science’ than of who can ‘be a scientist’”, write the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that language can have a big impact on how kids’ views of science develop through childhood. This is important, say the authors, because in schools and the media labels like “scientist” are common. The study suggests that teachers should reframe discussions to talk about “doing science” instead.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This careful use of language could be particularly useful to encourage interest in science amongst those who might not see themselves as fitting the stereotype of a scientist – although interestingly, a supplementary analysis didn’t actually find any differences in the effect of the action/identity framing between boys and girls, or those of different ethnic backgrounds. The authors suggest the study may have too few participants to detect those kinds of differences – this is an important area for future, larger studies to consider.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12837&quot;&gt;Children lose confidence in their potential to “be scientists”, but not in their capacity to “do science”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Research on Augmented Reality in nursing still in its infancy</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/05/16/research-on-augmented-reality-in-nursing-still-in-its-infancy/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/AR-nursing-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augmented Reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been an increase in the development of innovative digital technology, including Augmented Reality (AR). AR is the overlaying of virtual content on a user’s view of the real world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mkwi2018.leuphana.de/wp-content/uploads/MKWI_219.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cases&lt;/a&gt; supporting the use of AR smart glasses exist if an application is needed to be timely, mobile, and hands-free and continuous attention on the task is necessary. For example, in maintenance a worker could use a smart glass with a live-streaming feature to get advice of technicians, including watching demonstrations, while doing the work. Because of the novelty of AR applications, we find ourselves at an interesting waypoint in the process of finding further use cases for AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why think about Augmented Reality in nursing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nursing is an interesting field in which to apply AR, as nurses often have to work quickly, stay mobile, and have both their hands available for their work. Furthermore, new challenges in the nursing field, such as demographical change and rising multimorbidity, invite the use of new technologies. Technical solutions and social innovation may improve healthcare; however, it is important to take the special circumstances of care workers into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overviews regarding use cases of AR have been published for various fields. As there was no systematic review about AR in nursing, it was the logical step to conduct this work ourselves. With the review we aimed to gain insights to the following research question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To date, what research has been performed regarding the use of AR in nursing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodical challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we had a broad research question without concrete output categories, in the beginning we were not able to conduct a systematic review. Thus, we started looking for a type of review which allowed identifying relevant result categories during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New use cases for AR in nursing … will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, addressing the study quality was a challenging task. To date only a few studies on AR in nursing exist. Therefore, we decided to include studies of varying quality. Finally, we decided to conduct a scoping review. This review type allows the kinds of freedom we needed to identify relevant topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we followed the guidelines for scoping reviews, we still faced the task of identifying relevant topics inductively. To get an overview about topics mentioned in the studies we used a mindmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-019-0342-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We found&lt;/a&gt; 23 studies identifying use cases for AR in nursing. Use cases for AR in nursing focus on specific fields of use, and use case identification and requirements elicitation were often not described in detail. In addition, we identified that the results of studies evaluating AR in nursing were predominantly positive; however, several technical challenges were described for most of these devices. Moreover, most applications could be identified as prototypes in an early stage of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings in which the studies operated are noteworthy. While twelve studies could be grouped into a broad clinical setting with variation in use cases, eleven studies were set in the field of nursing education. We found that many studies focused on obtaining knowledge on the applications developed instead of the effects of technology inclusion on nursing. No studies questioned the clinical relevance of their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering context while evaluating applications would be an important goal for future research. This could be achieved through performing field trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future development trends, we infer that further technological advances will lead to new use cases for AR in nursing. These may be developed rapidly and will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we use the findings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arinflex.de&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consortium project&lt;/a&gt;, we had the aim to develop applications of AR in nursing. Thus, we needed an overview regarding existing developments. We have already used the results of our review, along with additional &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/48266&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;, to design and evaluate prototypes for applications in the fields of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/50054&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wound care management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/4438&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hand hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Benjamin Bonavida is a prolific science book author and recently retired as UCLA professor. He previously had to retract some papers as others took the blame. Yet Smut Clyde found so many fraudulent works signed by Bonavida that one wonders if this cancer researcher is a victim or rather the perpetrator here.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve been transported deep beneath the earth into a labyrinth of tunnels. You have a sword and a communications device, and your objective is to return to the surface. A figure appears in the dark ahead of you. Do you: (a) Use your communication device to say hello; (b) Formulate a contingency plan for escape and then approach the figure; or (c) Pause a moment to try to read its body language before stepping forward to approach the figure? &lt;/em&gt;[to interpret your preference, see end of post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality traits are traits are traditionally assessed by asking people to rate how much various descriptive statements match their own personality, like “I enjoy talking to strangers”. This cheap and easy approach has enjoyed great success – people’s scores on such tests tend to be impressively consistent over time, and they predict important outcomes from health to career success. However, the questionnaires are far from perfect. Research volunteers might not properly engage out of boredom, for instance. Job candidates might deliberately fake their scores to give a favourable impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting possibility for overcoming these issues, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886919301266?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; is to use a “gamification” approach – present people with behavioural options in engaging game-like scenarios and deduce their personality traits from their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37137&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the gamification approach to personality testing, John-Luke McCord at Louisiana State University and his colleagues consulted 11 personality psychology experts to help develop their tunnel-based game scenario. They ended up with 27 choice situations with the various options carefully worded to reflect the likely preferences of high scorers in the main “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then recruited 77 volunteers on Reddit (r/SampleSize) and had them work their way through the game and also complete an established questionnaire based method of assessing the Big Five traits, the IPIP-50. Based on the results, they tweaked the game and in a follow-up study gave the revised version to 98 undergrads, who also took the IPIP-50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining results from these two studies showed that participants’ trait scores based on their game choices correlated moderately with their trait scores as ascertained from the established personality questionnaire. This was true for all five main traits, with the correlation being weakest for openness (correlation was 0.14) and highest for extraversion (0.41).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team tried to obtain higher correlations between the game scores and questionnaire scores by trying out a new version of the game with more Reddit volunteers, this time with the choice options in each scenario worded to reflect different levels of one specific trait (more or less extraversion, for instance, rather than interpreting the choices as reflecting the influence of different traits). The game scores correlated with the questionnaire scores for all traits, except conscientiousness, perhaps because all players, regardless of their own personality, recognised the most conscientious option as optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection, however, McCord and his team said that perhaps they were barking up the wrong tree by trying to make the game and questionnaire results correlate as highly as possible, “as the ultimate goal is to accurately measure personality, not perfectly reflect an existing measure.” As their core motivation is to create a more realistic measure of personality (and especially personality-driven decision making), they added that it might be better to evaluate their game “with field studies or naturalistic observations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper was intended as a proof of concept, which the researchers believe they’ve achieved. Further refinement and a more technologically complex game could provide an even more accurate and realistic way to measure personality. “We believe that the future of game-like personality testing has promising potential for both research and practice,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886919301266?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Game-like personality testing: An emerging mode of personality assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting the scenario options&lt;/strong&gt;: The researchers say that choosing (a) would indicate higher trait extraversion; choosing (b) would indicate higher trait conscientiousness; and (c) would be taken as a sign of openness. My own preference – to immediately leg it in the opposite direction – is not given as an option, but would presumably reflect high trait neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You spend about 10 per cent of your waking hours with your eyes shut, simply because of blinking. Every few seconds, each time you blink, your retinas are deprived of visual input for a period lasting anywhere between tens to hundreds of milliseconds (500 milliseconds is equivalent to half a second). You don’t usually notice this, because your brain suppresses the dark spells and stitches together the bursts of visual information seamlessly. But these dips in visual processing in the brain do have an impact: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619842198&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; finds that, in an important way, they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37130&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how we perceive the passing of time has not been established, and just how important ongoing sensory processing might be is debated. The new work confirms that visual processing has an influence. “In finding that we lose time when we blink, we essentially can draw a link between early ongoing visual processing and the sense of time,” says Ayelet Landau at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, senior author on the study.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laundau and her colleagues, including first author Shany Grossman at the Weizmann Institute of Science, recruited 22 participant to complete a visual challenge, while 23 others completed an auditory task.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the visual challenge started, the participants were first shown a white circle for either a “short” period (0.6 seconds) or a “long” period (2.8 seconds). Then came the actual challenge – they were shown a white circle on a screen for varying periods of time, and asked to judge whether the duration of each appearance was closer to the “short” or “long” period. The participants in the auditory group took part in a similar challenge, except that they had to judge the durations of bursts of white noise. For both groups, a video-based eye tracker continuously measured their eye position and pupil diameter throughout the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ judgments during the visual task showed how blinks affect our sense of time. Specifically, participants underestimated the duration of the white circle’s appearance if they blinked while they were watching it. What’s more, for each individual, the duration of this blink correlated with their degree of time under-estimation. There was, as the researchers write, “a proportional relation between the objective duration of sensory-input loss and the loss of subjective time.” These results, they go on, can be interpreted as “supporting a central role for ongoing sensory encoding in the subjective sense of time.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the auditory group, in contrast, blinking had no impact on their judgements of noise durations.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, we often use many senses to process what’s going on. If we’re watching someone talking while listening to them, for example, would blinking have any effect on our perception of how long they spoke for? This kind of work has yet to be done. “One possibility is that during periods of missing information from one sense, only information flow in the other sense will take over our sense of time,” Landau suggests. “Another option is that if one sense is more highly weighted by the brain — as is the case for vision in watching a person speak — subjective time will rely primarily on this sense and will therefore be distorted by information loss in this sense.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study raises all kinds of fascinating questions for future research to investigate. Right now, I’m sitting at my desk, focusing on my computer screen — relying heavily on vision. Yes, I’m absorbed in what I’m doing. But is one reason why time seems to go more quickly when I’m working because my blinks are affecting my judgements of time passing, but when I’m outside, hanging out with my kids, other types of sensory input are preventing or counteracting the time-compressing blink-effect?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team is currently planning studies to investigate how multi-sensory processing impacts subjective time — so watch this space. But, “we would expect subjective time to be primarily informed by the sense we are [currently] focusing on,” Landau says.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: other ingenious studies have shown that it’s not the lack of stimulation of the retina, per se, that will alter time perception, but rather the dampening of activity in the visual cortex – a process triggered automatically by involuntary blinking (and which contributes to our seamless visual experience).

	<title>For Better Science: Edinburgh saves Bird men from clutches of Bulgarian Jezebel</title>

	<description>Irina Stancheva was investigated in Edinburgh for fraud at least twice, in 2009 and 2017, yet retraction and correction decisions were not implemented. Apparently to protect the reputation of  Nobel Prize candidate Sir Adrian Bird and  his male mentees, primarily Richard Meehan. One wonders: how much of Bird research in past two decades was actually fabricated by Stancheva?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Tomasz Witkowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the latest epidemiological data, it could be argued that we are in the midst of a pandemic of mental illness, of dimensions never before seen in human history. The WHO estimates that over 350 million people around the world are presently suffering from depression, which constitutes almost 5-6 per cent of the population. At its extreme, depression may lead to suicide, by which it is estimated that around 1 million people die every year. And the numbers continue growing. Faced with this rising tide of illness, it is impossible to overestimate the importance of hard facts and data indicating the paths researchers and clinicians may follow in search of ways to help. Sometimes, as suggested by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/23/after-half-a-century-of-research-psychology-cant-predict-suicidal-behaviours-better-than-by-coin-flip/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis of 50 years of studies on indicators that help predict suicide attempts&lt;/a&gt;, we are entirely helpless. In other cases, like with the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/06/this-is-how-psychotherapy-for-depression-changes-the-brain/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis of the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy in depressed brains&lt;/a&gt;, study results do bring us hope.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300247&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis of biological markers evaluated in randomized trials of psychological treatments for depression&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/i&gt; are another attempt at understanding methods of treating this terrifying illness. The authors – Ioana A. Cristea, Eirini Karyotaki, Steven D. Hollon, Pim Cuijpers and Claudio Gentili – quite rightly point out that understanding how psychological interventions impact or are impacted by biological variables has important implications. For many people, their depression co-occurs with a bodily illness, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and immune system and neurological disorders, and at times is a consequence of that illness. Although we still know little about the reciprocal cause-and-effect mechanisms between psychic and somatic symptoms, some studies have suggested that psychological interventions not only change mood, but also normalise the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, with a therapeutic effect on physical conditions, such as heart disease. But is this really true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37124&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors analysed fifty-one trials (5,123 adult participants; over half with a somatic disorder alongside depression) where biological markers such as glycemic control, cortisol concentration after-wake, immunological, neurobiological, inflammatory, weight and blood pressure were outcomes (in 43 studies) and/or predictors of treatment response (9 studies). In fact, only one-fifth of the trials reported statistically significant physiological benefits of a psychological intervention over control, and where present, such benefits were restricted to a tiny fraction of the total variables assessed. Although statistically significant, these limited positive effects were very weak. For measures related to glycemic control and cortisol concentration, psychotherapy did not outperform the controls at all.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results contradict the broadly held belief that psychotherapy impacts biology. There may be many reasons for this contradiction, but a likely one is that the belief came about on the basis of purely observational evidence (the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is measured almost exclusively with patients’ self-reports or clinician-rated scales, assessing symptoms or other subjective outcomes, and it’s possible these subjective ratings have given an exaggerated impression of the biological impact of psychotherapy).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors believe their failure to uncover evidence for psychotherapy having biological effects is most likely due primarily to methodological inconsistencies between studies (there was large variability across the biological domains and markers explored and overall findings were mixed), or to the confounding factors, such as placebo effects, that are so characteristic of studies on the biology of psychological illness. If they are correct, then in time, once researchers solidify their methodology, this will deliver new results that confirm the general belief in the beneficial effect of psychotherapy on disruptions to human biological functioning. However, if the researchers’ explanation is untrue, then the results of their new meta-analysis give rise to very fundamental doubts and questions: Is the dogma of psychophysical unity, presently accepted in contemporary psychology and medicine, correct? Is it possible that any associations which occur are of a solely unidirectional nature (biology modifies our mental states, but not the reverse)? And finally, perhaps the most banal question that would render the others meaningless: is it possible that the belief in psychotherapy’s capacity to alter biological functions in our bodies is nothing more than the product of marketing and hype?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking the answers to these questions, it is worth examining the manner in which particular types of psychotherapy came about. Were they created and modified on the basis of analysis of feedback (such as biomarkers) supplied by patients’ bodies? And if not, perhaps the issue is not with the methodological imperfections of studies looking for biological effects, but rather in the ways that psychotherapies are developed? To find answers to these questions, we have to analyse the methods that are used to shape psychotherapeutic interventions in the first place.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To many, the statement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Religion causes violence” seems intuitively true. After all, one can easily summon to mind a huge number of examples, from the Crusades to warfare connected with early Islam, to the September 11th attacks and sectarian warfare in the Middle East, and on and on and on. Some liberal-minded people, particularly those of an atheist bent, will rattle off these examples as clear proof that religion is a force for evil in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But what if it’s more complicated than that? What if there’s less evidence than one might think that religion causes violence? That’s the provocative thesis of an upcoming new article in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cvir.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;a journal launched in April of 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;available &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/gzspe/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as a preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), authored by Joshua Wright and Yuelee Khoo at Simon Fraser University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37106&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The paper is mostly dedicated to a literature review which summarises a wide array of findings about the supposed link between religion and violence. Overall, Wright and Khoo argue that the literature points in both directions, and that there’s little reason, at this relatively early juncture in understanding the connection between religion and behaviour, to believe that there’s something unique to religious ideologies that cause them to foster violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That said, there are certainly plenty of studies on the side of the ledger that suggest religion does cause violence. For example, the authors cite research showing that the more that people felt the September 11th attacks to be a violation of their sacred values, the more likely they were to “endorse … the use of nuclear and biological weapons in response.” Similarly, “The more Christians perceive Jews as desecrators of Christianity, the more prejudice they exhibit toward [them].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the authors also highlight complexities that fog up the picture. For example, they cite one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00264.x&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; by US psychologist Tammy Greer that found (in Wright’s and Khoo’s words) “greater frequency of church attendance and greater frequency of engagement in church activities was associated with less self-reported vengeance,” but at the same time that “a more consistent donation pattern was related to greater self-reported vengeance.” This suggests that, in some circumstances at least, asking slightly different questions about religiosity can yield answers pointing opposite directions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other studies, meanwhile, provide apparently unequivocal evidence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;against&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the “religion causes violence” argument, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000647&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of “600 men in the Arkansas correctional system” for whom religiosity was correlated with “lower self-reported acts of actual violent behavior over one’s lifetime,” which lined up with the results of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386973&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; showing an inverse link between church attendance and crime in Sweden. And “Longitudinal work confirms the relationship between greater involvement in religious activities and less aggressive behavior across the lifespan,” say Wright and Khoo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;So the literature is clearly a hodgepodge. And even if religion can be linked to an increased susceptibility to violence, the authors point out that this is not unique to religion. “While threat perceptions toward individuals’ religious identities may institute aggressive or violent responses, these effects are a product of a general social psychological process of group behavior, rather than anything inherent to religion,” they write. That is, when ardent adherents of secular ideologies sense threat, they, too, often lash out at outsiders – what’s going on is a fairly universal aspect of social psychology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There could have been many situations in which researchers, by only asking questions about religion, missed this bigger picture. For example, while attendance at religious services has been associated with increased hostility toward, and intentions to harm, outgroups, it could be that religious attendance is simply a proxy for people having strong in-group identification. It’s plausible that greater attendance at national, sporting or other secular ceremonies, might similarly correlate with hostility towards relevant outgroups – but if the only questions you ask are about religion, the only answers you get will be about religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In their conclusion, Wright and Khoo make a final point that should give pause to anyone who thinks the research literature, at present, offers a comprehensive look at the link between religion and violence. As they explain, “What makes religion unique … is a belief in the supernatural, the meaning of this belief to the individual and the group, and the internalization and integration of religious identity to the individual.” And yet “Direct study of supernaturalism is noticeably absent in the literature.” If the authors are correct, this means researchers have so far left out the single most important aspect of religious identity – leaving an incomplete picture as to whether it really does have a unique effect on the likelihood of violence or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attachment theory, which was first proposed in the 1950s by the British psychoanalyst John Bowlby, is one of the most influential in psychology. It argues for the importance of our earliest relationships with our caregivers, and predicts that these formative bonds will shape the nature of our connections with other people for the rest of our lives. Remarkably, however, psychologists still know relatively little about how people’s attachment style – essentially their characteristic style of relating to other people – typically varies through life. “How do attachment orientations change across the life span? Unfortunately … this critical question has eluded researchers,” write William Chopik and colleagues in their recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33544-001&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research is the first to document how attachment style varies, on average, through decades of the lifespan, from age 13 to 72. The results suggest that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/09/new-insights-into-lifetime-personality-change-from-meta-study-featuring-50000-participants/&quot;&gt;like other aspects of personality&lt;/a&gt;, attachment style is relatively stable through life, but that it is not entirely fixed, and in particular that it may be shaped by our relationship experiences, as well as the varied social demands of different life stages. “The current study is one of the first truly longitudinal investigations into life span changes in attachment orientation and the antecedents of these changes,” write Chopik and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37096&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from five historic projects, involving personality surveys of 628 US citizens born between 1920 and 1967. The shortest of these was 9 years and the longest was 47 years. They all involved participants being assessed repeatedly over many years using the California Adult Q-sort – a measure that includes 100 personality items. Chopik and his team focused on 14 key items from this measure, allowing them to compile scores for “anxious attachment” and “avoidant attachment” for each participant. People who score highly on “anxious attachment” fear rejection and constantly seek reassurance. People who score highly on “avoidant attachment” find intimacy uncomfortable and find it difficult to provide emotional support to others. Low scores on both anxiety and avoidance is a sign of having a secure attachment style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stitched the data from the five historic samples together, so that they had scores for anxious and avoidant attachment spanning 59 years. Past research has already looked at how people of different ages vary in their attachment scores, but one problem with that kind of cross-sectional research is that any differences between people of different ages could be due to generational differences, rather than due to developmental trends. The new research largely overcome that problem, with Chopik and his team able to identify clear age-related trends in the same individuals over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team found that people’s anxious attachment tended to be high in adolescence, increasing into their young adulthood, before then declining through life into their middle and old age. Avoidant attachment showed less change with age, but started higher in adolescence and then declined in linear fashion through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers surmised that attachment anxiety and avoidance may be high in adolescence due to the stressful transition from having primarily close bonds with parents to having meaningful relationships with peers and first romantic relationships. They also pointed out that mid-life – when anxiety and avoidance tend to decline – is arguably the time when we are most invested in various social roles and relationships and that “…increases in security often result from people becoming more comfortable in their relationships, gaining more evidence that the relationship will last, and having spouses who serve attachment needs and functions that promote close relations.” Meanwhile, in later life, when attachment anxiety and avoidance are typically lowest, they said people tend to be very focused on the here and now – “declines in anxiety and avoidance may reflect the efforts of older adults to become closer to their close friends and family,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding from the study was that at all times of life, being in a close romantic relationship tended to go hand in hand with scoring lower on attachment anxiety and avoidance. “Romantic partners reward appropriate behaviour and admonish inappropriate behaviour … ,” the researchers said. “By investing in these social roles, individuals adhere to the rules and appropriate behaviour of close relationships and may change how they approach relationships accordingly, perhaps becoming more secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that this research looked at group averages, which inevitably masks the idiosyncratic ways that some people may change in their attachment style through life. The study is also limited by only involving participants from the US, the fact that it relied on extracting attachment scores from a measure not designed for that purpose, and that data was stitched together from multiple samples so as to cover the period from adolescence to later life. In a way, however, that last point is also a positive: “given the many ways in which these samples differed, the amount of consistency across the samples in estimating changes over time in attachment is even more remarkable. The converging evidence is a testament to the robustness of these results, such that they were found under different conditions in samples collected between 1936 and 2016,” the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty for future research to build on, including looking at how the consequences of different attachment styles might vary at different stages of life, and whether and how early life experiences might interact with the developmental trends identified in this study.  The researchers concluded that “By examining these future directions and identifying the conditions under which attachment orientations change, we can finally start taking seriously Bowlby’s claim that attachment experiences are important from the cradle to the grave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33544-001&quot;&gt;Longitudinal changes in attachment orientation over a 59-year period&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of ways to calm ourselves via our senses, the obvious is to listen to relaxing music, have a massage, or perhaps to gaze upon a rustic scene. However, evidence is growing for a far less obvious option involving the vestibular system (located in the inner ear), which detects the position and movement of the head. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/01/rock-a-bye-adult-study-shows-grown-ups-enjoy-better-sleep-and-memory-consolidation-in-a-rocking-bed/&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, gentle rocking helps adults to fall asleep for a nap, and to sleep more soundly during an entire night, with the researchers who conducted that research hypothesising that the effect is driven by the vestibular system. Now new exploratory work by a different team provides further hints that stimulating the vestibular system can help to calm the brain — in this case, apparently reducing anxiety.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00014/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_973135_55_Neuros_20190425_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, led by Florane Pasquier at the University of Caen Normandy, the 22 healthy young adult participants weren’t physically rocked. Rather, electrodes, placed behind their ears, delivered a very mild, 1mA current to stimulate the nerves that carry signals from the individual components of the vestibular system to the brain. This technique is called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37077&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student participants took part in three sessions, each one held at the same time on the same day each week for three weeks. One was a 38-minute sham session during which no current was used; another involved 38 minutes of GVS, while the last involved 76-minutes of the stimulation (participants completed the different sessions in a randomised order). Before and after each session, the participants indicated on a visual scale how relaxed or tense they felt (as a simple measure of their anxiety levels), and also reported any feelings of motion sickness (a conflict between signals from the vestibular system versus the eyes and other sensory receptors in the body is thought to cause motion sickness.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one session was associated with a significant decrease in the anxiety measure the researchers reported: the shorter, 38-minute period of stimulation. This was associated with a drop of about one quarter in the anxiety measure, post- vs pre-test, whereas there was no drop after the sham treatment, and only a hint of a much smaller drop after the double-duration stimulation. Pasquier’s team suspect that the electrical stimulation of neurons from the vestibular system may simulate the effects of gentle rocking, as in a train or car&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;— something that can make many of us, whether adults or children, feel drowsy. “A possible hypothesis is the sedative effect of GVS on arousal state,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are consistent with other studies that have also found vestibular stimulation can affect mood. For example, one that found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800522/&quot;&gt;swinging on a swing improved the anxiety&lt;/a&gt; levels of university students.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t the longer session of GVS work? It’s not clear. Perhaps a clue comes from the fact that after a 76-minute session — but not the shorter 38-minute session— some participants reported feeling motion sickness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is preliminary research. The anxiety measure was simple, and the study was conducted on a small number of young adults who didn’t report having any anxiety problems. Might a shorter session reduce anxiety scores, too? Is the apparent anxiety effect sustained, and if so, for how long? Could GVS make any real-world difference to people suffering from an anxiety disorder, or who are about to go into an anxiety-provoking situation, and is it 100 per cent safe? Only future research will tell. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the movie scene: a nervous aide has to deliver bad news to his villainous boss, stumbling over his words and incessantly apologising. For a second, it looks like he will be OK – until the boss turns around and summarily executes him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out this phenomenon of “shooting the messenger” is not just restricted to fiction. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-19962-004&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt; has demonstrated that we do tend to take a dim view of the bearers of bad news – even when these people are simply innocent messengers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37074&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work had already shown that we often form unfavourable opinions of people who give us negative feedback. But this could be justified: the reviewer could have been unfairly biased against us, for example. Leslie John and colleagues at Harvard University wanted to take things further and find out how we view others who are simply a conduit for bad news, and who clearly have no control over the content of the message they’re sharing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of 11 experiments, the team looked at how people responded when taking part in, or imagining, a situation where someone delivered them bad or good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study confirmed that bearers of bad news are not well-liked. Participants had the chance to win an extra $2 when a research assistant picked a number from a hat, depending on whether it was odd or even. After picking the number, the research assistant handed it to a colleague – the “messenger” – to read out. Participants who received bad news – that they had not won the extra $2 – later rated this innocent messenger as less likeable than those who received good news.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent studies, the team tried to figure out exactly what was driving people to shoot the messenger. The effect seemed to be specific to those who deliver the news, with others present at the same time remaining unaffected. In one scenario, for example, participants imagined a hospital appointment where they received either good or bad news about whether a skin biopsy was cancerous. There were two nurses in the scenario, one who delivered the news and the other who was there to schedule a follow-up appointment – but only the “messenger” nurse was rated as less likeable when the news was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the effect was stronger in situations in which bad news was unexpected or made less sense. In another scenario, participants imagined that while waiting at the airport, a staff member announced that their flight was delayed by three hours. Half of the participants were told that flights would still be departing in the scheduled order, while the rest were told that another plane had been given their flight’s departure slot. In the latter situation (which, the authors write, “violate[s] the commonly held beliefs that the world is just, predictable, and comprehensible”), the participants gave the staff member a particularly low likeability rating.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a handful of experiments revealed that people may shoot the messenger because they believe the messenger has nefarious motives – even when this doesn’t make logical sense. One group had the chance to win 50 cents if they predicted correctly whether the number of words in the main headline of the next day’s &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; was even or odd. The next day, those who heard from a research assistant that they had guessed wrong didn’t just rate this researcher as less likable – they also said they thought that the researcher had been hoping they’d get it wrong, even though she clearly had no control over the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the research suggests that “shooting the messenger” has a real basis in the way people act in everyday situations. It seems to stem from a number of sources, including a desire to make sense of negative or unexpected situations, and a tendency to misattribute malicious motives to messengers. While the researchers concentrated on the “likability” of the messenger, they add that participants could be making other negative judgements as well: for example, one of the studies found that people also judge bringers of bad news as less competent.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tendencies make life harder for both messenger and receiver, the authors say. Delivering bad news is already a difficult task, and being seen as unlikable only adds to that struggle. And because people aren’t keen on accepting advice from those they dislike, they might miss out on important help. “Especially when the messenger is integral to the solution, as is often the case in medical contexts, ‘shooting the messenger’ may impede people from taking steps to make their own futures brighter,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five tiny new frog species found in Madagascar–meet the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mini &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;frogs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Three of these five new species, all of which range from 7.7-15 mm in length, belong to an entirely new genus: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Mini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These Madagascan frogs’ miniscule scale enriches the picture of convergent evolution towards tininess in frog species (in addition to being extremely cute). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Lead author Mark Scherz says: ‘When frogs evolve small body size, they start to look remarkably similar, so it is easy to underestimate how diverse they really are. Our new genus name, , says it all: adults of the two smallest species &lt;em&gt;Mini mum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mini scule&lt;/em&gt;, are 8–11 mm, and even the largest member of the genus, &lt;em&gt;Mini ature&lt;/em&gt;, at 15 mm, could sit on your thumbnail with room to spare.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even more concerningly, a post-study questionnaire revealed that participants were unaware of their incomplete coverage. As we move into summer here in the Northern Hemisphere, don’t forget your eyes need sun protection (and sunglasses are always an option, too!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Co-author Austin McCormick adds: “Moisturiser is not as well applied as sunscreen; therefore, if planning prolonged sun exposure we advise sunscreen be used. If using moisturiser we advise one with SPF: any SPF is better than none, but it should not be considered the equal of sunscreen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climate Change May Contribute to Hay Fever Increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/spring-_-pollen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8549 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/spring-_-pollen-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you suffer from hay fever, climate change might be contributing to your allergies. A recent study in PLOS ONE showed that areas in the USA where the onset of spring was earlier than normal–or significantly later than normal–corresponded to an increased prevalence in hay fever sufferers. Lead author Amir Sapkota and colleagues used NASA satellite data along with CDC National Health Interview data to compile this first quantitative dataset pointing to a link between spring timing and allergies. The authors speculate that early spring means a longer season for tree pollen, whereas a late spring may mean a high pollen concentration across many different species–in either case, bad news for allergy sufferers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sapkota adds: “We need to better prepare, and increase community resilience to minimize the disease burden associated with climate change.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power (or powerlessness) of parents to shape their children for good or ill continues to preoccupy psychologists and the public alike. Among evolutionary-minded developmental psychologists, one specific idea is that girls’ later attitudes to relationships is influenced by their fathers’ behaviour. For instance, US research has found that girls with disengaged, harsh, and often absent fathers are known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/sex-specific-pathways-to-early-puberty-sexual-debut-and-sexual-ri&quot;&gt;start having sex at a younger age&lt;/a&gt;, and to have more sexual partners. However many questions about these findings remain. For example: might other aspects of the girls’ childhoods be involved; what about genetic effects; and which aspects of poor-quality fathering are the most consequential? &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/dev0000741&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of pairs of sisters, published in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, provides some specific answers, particularly that it is contact with a poor-quality father, not paternal absence, that affects their daughters’ later relationships, including their expectations of men, and, in turn, their sexual behaviour. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37062&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle DelPriore at Pennsylvania State University and colleagues recruited 233 pairs of biological sisters who were all of reproductive age (18-36), born at least four years apart, and whose parents had divorced or separated before the younger sister turned 14. On average, the older sisters had spent 5.6 years longer living with their fathers than the younger sisters.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sister-pair design allowed the researchers to focus in, as much as possible, on the effects of the father’s behaviour, and his presence or absence from the home. They reasoned that, for each pair, while the younger sister would have spent less time living with their father, most other potential influences on their attitudes to men and their sexual behaviour – including childhood culture, religion, and even genes, to some extent – would be similar.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sisters all completed assessments of the quality of their childhood relationship with their father (rating his warmth or harshness, and his involvement in their daily lives, for example). They also rated levels of any paternal behavioural or mental health problems (noting drug abuse or suicide attempts, for example) while they were growing up. The women also completed assessments of their expectations for men as parents and partners, and reported on how many sexual partners they had had in the past year, and how many different sexual partners they would like to have, and expected to have, in future.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that older sisters who were exposed to poor-quality paternal behaviour (particularly in terms of behavioural or mental health problems) reported lower expectations of the investment they were likely to receive from a male partner. These women also reported having more sexual partners. (Women who don’t expect to get much support from a partner may be more likely to engage in short-term relationships, it has been suggested.) For the younger sisters, who had spent significantly less time living with their fathers, the analysis revealed no effect of paternal behaviour on these measures. The researchers also gathered ratings of maternal warmth, and in contrast to the paternal findings, these did not relate to expectations of male partners, or sexual behaviour.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It appears that the father’s behaviour while in the home rather than his absence from the home has the strongest influence on his daughter’s sexual behaviour,” DelPriore and her colleagues concluded.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly limitations to the study. An important one is that it’s based on self-reports of events and behaviour in the past, and retrospective reports are known to be vulnerable to bias and error. Also, it’s very hard to tease out the individual effects of numerous variables. But this study does go some way towards trying to isolate potential influences of a father’s behaviour on his daughter’s relationships with men, and in so doing “provides a modifiable target for interventions attempting to reduce risky sexual behavior” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, neuroimaging studies have provided new insights into how psychoactive drugs alter the brain’s activity. Psilocybin – the active ingredient in magic mushrooms – has been found to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/182410/magic-mushrooms-reset-brains-depressed-patients/&quot;&gt;reduce activity in brain regions involved in depression&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while MDMA seems to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345398&quot;&gt;augment brain activity for positive memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new study sheds some light into what’s going in the brain when people smoke cannabis – and it turns out that the effects can be quite different depending on the specific strain of the drug. The research, published recently in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119841568?journalCode=jopa&quot;&gt;suggests that cannabis disrupts particular brain networks&lt;/a&gt; – but some strains can buffer against this disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabis contains two major active ingredients: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is responsible for many of the drug’s psychoactive effects, such as the feeling of being stoned and the anxiety that people sometimes feel, as well as feelings of euphoria. High-THC strains of cannabis – known as skunk – are commonly consumed, with modern strains often having little CBD content, say the authors, and this has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;put smokers at higher risk of developing psychosis. CBD, which is present at varying levels in other recreational strains of cannabis, doesn’t produce intoxication but may reduce anxiety and psychotic symptoms, suggesting it could block potentially harmful effects of THC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, few neuroimaging studies have examined how brain activity is influenced by different concentrations of these two ingredients. So Matthew Wall and colleagues decided to look at the neural effects of two strains of cannabis: one high in THC but with no CBD, and the other with high levels of both compounds.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 17 participants who used cannabis fairly regularly but not heavily. All participants completed three sessions; in each session they were given one of the two strains of cannabis, or a placebo that didn’t contain either compound but still smelled like the drug. Half an hour after inhaling the vaporised drug, the participants had an MRI scan to measure their resting brain activity. After the scan they rated the intensity of the drug’s effects, scoring themselves on measures such as&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;such as how anxious they were or how dry their mouth was.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at patterns of connectivity within brain networks while participants were on the different drugs. They were particularly interested in the default mode network (DMN), which is active when we’re just resting and/or thinking about ourselves, and the salience network, which is involved in switching between this kind of internally-focused state and engaging with the outside world.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that when participants smoked either strain of cannabis, the functional connectivity within their DMN was disrupted compared to when they smoked the placebo. But the pattern of disruption was strikingly different depending on the strain. Most prominently, the THC-only strain disrupted connectivity within an area of the DMN called the posterior cingulate cortex, and the amount of disruption in this area was directly related to participants’ ratings of the intensity of the drug’s effects. When participants took the strain that also contained CBD, disruption in this brain area disappeared, suggesting that CBD was blocking this effect. Differences between the two strains were also apparent in the salience network, where the THC-only strain similarly caused much more widespread disruption than the CBD strain.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that CBD may act as a “buffer” against some of the neurological effects of THC, the researchers say, particularly those in the posterior cingulate cortex that are related to feelings of intoxication. This region also contains a high density of the receptors which THC acts upon, and other research has found that long-term use of cannabis can reduce the number of these receptors. This suggests that disruption in the posterior cingulate cortex could be related to the development of harmful long-term effects of the drug like psychosis and dependence – and that strains of cannabis that include CBD may be able to protect against these damaging effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that further evidence is needed for this theory – and it will also be important to study the effects of the strains in other populations. In this study, the researchers examined only semi-regular users who had never experienced any problems with drug-taking. The effects of cannabis in the brain could be very different in this group compared to those who have never taken the drug – or those who have had negative experiences with it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, understanding that not all strains of cannabis are created equal is important in a time where the drug is becoming more widely accepted, the authors say. “As cannabis transitions to legal/decriminalized status in many jurisdictions, understanding the neural effects of different strains of cannabis (with different levels of THC and CBD) is now a priority for public health,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119841568?journalCode=jopa&quot;&gt;Dissociable effects of cannabis with and without cannabidiol on the human brain’s resting-state functional connectivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Pregnancy-and-Childbirth-7-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2069-6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Music during cesarean section can reduce stress and anxiety in new mothers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesarean section is a common surgery that, like most surgical procedures, can cause stress and anxiety in patients. Stress and anxiety in women undergoing cesarean section is especially concerning due to negative effects on post-operative recovery, lactation, and newborn development. More non-pharmacological treatments are needed to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has long been considered to have stress-reducing effects, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615601696&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;numerous trials have shown&lt;/a&gt; that playing music during the surgical process reduces pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Although there have been a few studies on music during cesarean section, there is no strong evidence of an effect on validated or objective measures of stress and anxiety of patients. Therefore, Hepp &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a randomized controlled trial to examine if music during cesarean section reduces both validated patient-reported and objective measures of stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11015 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/music-300x150.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and four patients were randomized to hear music from their choice of genre or no music during standard cesarean surgery. Both groups had high self-reported anxiety before the start of the procedure, but the group that heard music reported a significantly greater reduction in anxiety at the end of the procedure. Measurement of a stress hormone at the end of the procedure showed that stress sensation during surgery was significantly lower in the group that heard music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these results show that playing music during surgery is a relatively easy way to reduce stress and anxiety in new mothers giving birth by cesarean surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1871-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Can treatment and care practices influence normal birth outcomes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that the use of medical interventions during labor and birth has slowly increased over the course of the last two decades in over 20 developed countries.  Although medical interventions can be beneficial to mothers and their newborns, they do pose additional risks.  As such, new policies and reforms have been implemented internationally in favor of normal birth, which is defined as an unassisted vaginal birth without labor induction, epidural, anesthesia, or episiotomy.  Despite the increased interest in facilitating normal birth, few studies have assessed the factors that inhibit it. This study aimed to evaluate both the modifiable and non-modifiable factors influencing the outcome of normal birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, Prosser &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, obtained data from the Having a Baby in Queensland Survey. The original survey included all women who gave birth between 2011 and 2012 in Queensland, Australia and evaluated women’s maternity care experiences. From this data, the authors determined that the non-modifiable factors that reduced the likelihood of normal birth included gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, previous cesarean section, the number of previous births, age, and later-term pregnancies. The leading modifiable factors that contributed to increased rates of normal birth included continuity of care through labor, freedom of movement, and a non-supine position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also assessed the model of care and found that midwifery-led care (both public and private), GP shared care and standard public care resulted in the highest rates of normal birth while private obstetrics care resulted in the lowest rates of normal birth within the study sample.  Interestingly, these results also account for both obstetric and social risk factors, leading the authors to argue that these disparities might be a result of the philosophical differences between the two models of perinatal care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors concluded that treatment and care practices can influence normal birth outcomes and normal birth may increase with the appropriate facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1656-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breastfeeding experience among obese women – challenges and how to overcome them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11013&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11013&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Claesson-BF-300x257.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Claesson et al., 2019&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that “breast is best” and that breastfeeding is beneficial to both mothers and infants, with increased duration of breastfeeding providing increased benefits. However, many women face challenges in initiation and/or continuation of breastfeeding for a wide variety of reasons. One group that has been shown to have a lower rate and duration of breastfeeding is mothers with obesity.  These women may face barriers which include complications during delivery delaying the initiation of breastfeeding, physical discomfort, and reduced body confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ing-Marie Claesson and colleagues conducted a qualitative study focusing on 11 obese breastfeeding women in Sweden in order to understand their points of view, which is crucial to developing effective ways to support these women. Although some women had reservations, most intended to breastfeed, viewing it as an integral and natural part of motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants identified three categories of challenges. First, there were difficulties in finding a position that worked both for their own bodily comfort and their infant’s ability to nurse. Some women felt that infants had more difficulty nursing from their larger breasts. Second, the need to expose at least some part of their bodies in order to breastfeed discouraged some of the women, especially from breastfeeding in public. This was linked to low overall self-esteem, which was affected by being obese. Lastly, the unexpected difficulties in breastfeeding led to frustration and disappointment, which in some cases led to giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women also discussed the support they did or did not receive from healthcare providers. Some participants felt that the focus on the infant’s weight gain led to a pressure to switch to formula. Other participants recalled that support from healthcare providers who did not focus on their obesity increased their confidence and strengthened them as breastfeeding mothers. These experiences highlight the need for individualized support that helps women with obesity overcome the practical difficulties of breastfeeding without the focus being on the mother’s weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1745-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders and Pregnancy: what are the barriers for identification during the perinatal period?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders (EDs) can affect up to eight percent of pregnant women and are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.  Pregnant women suffering from Anorexia Nervosa face risks such as premature birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight, while pregnant women suffering from Binge Eating disorder face increased risk for delivering a baby with a higher birth weight. Due to these risks, early identification of EDs is necessary for tailoring antenatal care needs.  In this study, the obstacles of disclosing and identifying EDs were evaluated from the perspective of both pregnant women and health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, found that although women reported an overall reduction in eating disorder symptoms during pregnancy, over half of the participants experienced some symptoms, most commonly binge eating and restricting calories.  Despite these symptoms, only 26% disclosed to a health care professional.  The authors then developed five themes based on interviews conducted with women who did not disclose their symptoms:  stigma, lack of opportunity, preference for self-management, current ED symptomatology, and illness awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10200 alignright&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Eating-Disorders-Pregnancy-1-300x169.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After surveying pregnant women, Bye &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;conducted a focus group with healthcare students and professionals, including both midwives and health visitors.  Many of the healthcare providers felt that they lacked adequate knowledge on EDs in pregnancy because it wasn’t included in their training at all or training was limited.  Some also thought that this contributed to the lack of knowledge of the relevant policies and management guidelines for EDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the leading factor inhibiting disclosure amongst pregnant women was stigma.  Similarly, healthcare students and professionals felt they were ill-equipped to help those they had suspected might have an ED.  As a result, the authors argue that improvements in eating disorder education is needed amongst prenatal healthcare providers to give them more confidence in the identification of eating disorders, decrease stigma, and lead to better guidelines for how to address the disorder.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/05/22/better-training-could-help-health-professionals-identify-and-support-pregnant-women-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our blog post by the authors of this study&lt;/a&gt; where they discuss specific activities that could raise both professional and public awareness about eating disorders in order to improve pregnancy outcomes and patient experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your personality traits play an important part in how long you are likely to live, as much as, or even more than, other personal factors like your intelligence and your family’s economic background. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618302502&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt; has identified a key factor that mediates the personality-mortality link – sleep. Simply put, people with certain personality characteristics are more likely to sleep too little, or too much, or to experience greater sleepiness during the day, and in turn this raises their year-on-year risk of dying (too little or excess sleep, and poor quality sleep, have known links with various health risks, such as cardiovascular disease, depression and chronic inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sleep has been associated with both personality and longevity, yet [before now] no study has investigated whether sleep is a pathway linking personality to objective health outcomes,” say the researchers, led by Shantel Spears at West Virginia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37011&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data collected from thousands of participants as part of the long-running National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, including information on their personality traits recorded in 1995-1996, and information on their sleep duration and sleep quality collected in 2004-2006. Nearly 4000 participants provided data at both these time points, and the researchers then used national records to see which of them had died and when, up to October, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, based on the known importance of sleep to health, the research showed that too little or too much sleep was associated with increased risk of dying – approximately 65 minutes more than, or under, the average nightly sleep duration (7 hours in this sample) was associated with a 10 per cent increased risk of dying over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to personality, and consistent with many prior studies, participants who scored lower on trait conscientiousness were more likely to die before the end of the research period, and Spears’ team established that this was explained in part by these people getting less sleep, on average, and feeling less rested during the day (a mark of poorer sleep quality). Although the study didn’t look into why exactly people low in conscientiousness were getting less sleep, one can imagine they engage in more &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/01/psychologists-investigate-a-major-ignored-reason-for-our-lack-of-sleep-bedtime-procrastination/&quot;&gt;bedtime procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, and generally struggle to establish &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/21/episode-11-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep/&quot;&gt;a healthy bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, high scorers on trait neuroticism were indirectly at greater risk of dying because of their lower and higher than average amounts of sleep, and their on-average greater feelings of fatigue in the daytime. Again, one can speculate that these folk, who have lower moods and more worry, might struggle to get to sleep or to get up promptly in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower scores on extraversion were indirectly linked with increased risk of death, thanks to an association with greater daytime feelings of fatigue (perhaps extraverts’ greater daytime activity levels makes it easier for them to get a satisfying night’s sleep, but this is speculation). Most surprising – given prior research findings have not identified this trait as being relevant to sleep – was the indirect link between higher trait agreeableness and risk of dying, explained by these people having less sleep and more daytime fatigue; it’s not clear why this might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research had already established that personality predicts longevity because of its association with various health behaviours, such as more conscientious people being less likely to smoke, or drink and eat to excess. However, much of the personality-linked variance in risk of dying has remained unexplained, and this study now identifies too little or too much sleep (and feeling insufficiently rested during the day) as other important factors. “Our findings suggest that short and long sleep duration and daytime dysfunction may be important pathways linking aspects of personality to reduced life expectancy,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has some important limitations including the participants being mostly white and highly educated; the reliance on a short self-report test of personality; and the subjective measure of sleep being based on time spent in bed rather being asleep per se. Nonetheless, if the results can be replicated, they raise some important implications for public health, suggesting that personality screening could be used to identify those people – especially high scorers in neuroticism and low scorers in conscientiousness – most likely to benefit from interventions aimed at improving sleep. “Alternatively,” the researchers said, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/&quot;&gt;changing these aspects of personality&lt;/a&gt; could improve sleep for these individuals, enhancing their health and longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/PTTP-header-image_blog-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Can you believe it’s been one whole year since we launched our preprint-posting partnership with bioRxiv? This calls for a celebration! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Just last May, we began offering authors the choice of having PLOS post their manuscript to the preprint server, bioRxiv, when they submitted to a PLOS journal*. Our opt-in service has made it easier for authors to post their work early and has encouraged many authors to try preprinting their research for the first time. As of today, we’ve posted more than 2,500 preprints! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many of our authors have now seen their work go from preprint to published and it’s amazing to see the transformation their work has taken – just take a look at the examples below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we preprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re an author, an editor, or just an avid science reader, preprints offer a lot of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;advantages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for how we share and consume information: they allow research to be shared openly and broadly, spark feedback and collaborations that may not have happened otherwise, enable authors to claim results and demonstrate their work for timely opportunities such as grant proposals and promotions. But if you really want to know how preprints advance science, just ask our authors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/SHawinkle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8503 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/SHawinkle.png&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“As statisticians, we provide analysis and data visualization methods for scientists in the field. Sharing code through GitHub and preprints through bioRxiv provides researchers with the latest methodologies as early as possible. The other benefit is that the scientific community can provide researchers with useful feedback prior to publication. This means that we can tailor new methods to scientists’ needs. These interactions were very enriching, and I recommend Open Science to everybody.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We actually improved the final version of our paper not only based on the great reviews we received from the formal peer review process, but also based on the feedback we learned through Twitter, and other channels.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At submission, I believed we had a complete story that would interest researchers working on various aspects of adhesion biology. I knew that the story would likely develop further after peer review, but I wanted to share the core results with the community.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During major bouts of anger or fear, people can end up taking extreme and sometimes violent actions. But they often say that, in the moment, they didn’t feel responsible for those actions – they “lost control” or “saw red”. In the UK, under certain circumstances, a person accused of murder can even claim that this “loss of control” led to them killing their victim. If successful, this defence can reduce charges to manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the first study of its kind suggests that there is some truth to these claims. Participants put into a fearful or angry state really do seem to have a reduced sense of agency, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-018-5461-6&quot;&gt;paper published recently in &lt;i&gt;Experimental Brain Research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, raising questions about the accountability of people going through extreme emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36996&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia Christensen and colleagues at University College London assessed participants’ sense of agency while they were in different emotional states. To do this, they used a measure of a perceptual distortion known as “intentional binding”. Intentional binding refers to the fact that we perceive &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/05/physical-effort-fuels-a-feeling-of-ownership-over-our-movements/&quot;&gt;our deliberate physical actions as occurring closer in time to their sensory consequences than was really the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the standard task demonstrating this effect, participants press a button while watching a clock hand which is constantly rotating. They have to say what time was indicated by the clock hand when they pressed the button. On some trials, pressing the button triggers a noise a fraction of a second later, while on other trials pressing the button doesn’t have any consequence. For the trials in which there is a noise, intentional binding means that people tend to say that they pressed the button later than they really did (and later than in the silent trials), closer in time to the noise. Crucially for current purposes, intentional binding only occurs for deliberate, voluntary actions, and in fact a larger intentional binding effect is usually taken by researchers as evidence that a participant feels more in control of her or his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study used this standard intentional binding task – but with a twist. During the task, the researchers also induced feelings of fear or anger in their participants. For the fear condition, participants saw the word “Threat!” on screen during some trials, which signalled that they might receive a painful electric shock.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the anger condition, participants sometimes performed an additional task where they had to respond to a sound by pressing a button as quickly as possible in order to avoid losing money. To enrage the participants, the researchers made this task impossible to win: the participants were always told they were too slow and received the financial penalty.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three experiments – two that induced fear and one anger – the researchers found that participants had reduced intentional binding when they were in an emotional state. That is, for the fear and anger trials, participants’ perception of when they pressed the button shifted less towards the timing of the noise compared to neutral trials.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that the participants had a reduced sense of agency over their button-pressing when they felt fear and anger. This provides some of the first evidence that going through extreme negative emotions can in fact make people feel less in control, as has often been assumed. And the fact that this effect was found using an implicit measure of agency, rather than by simply asking participants whether they felt in control, suggests that it may be happening at a fairly fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are limitations to the study: most noticeably that there was no condition in which the researchers induced a positive emotion like happiness. It could be that strong emotional states generally reduce people’s sense of agency, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. And one of the two fear experiments did not actually produce a significant result but was only reported as a trend, so it remains to be seen whether the results will be replicated in another sample.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the research provides some scientific rationale for the “loss of control” defence, there are still much broader ethical and legal questions. Even if extreme negative emotional states do leave people with a reduced sense of control over their actions, for example, that doesn’t necessarily imply that they should be absolved of any sins they commit. “The fact that sense of agency is reduced by negative emotional states does not demonstrate total lack of responsibility, nor condone any specific action,” the authors write. “&lt;i&gt;Feeling&lt;/i&gt; less responsible does not necessarily &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; one actually less responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-018-5461-6&quot;&gt;I just lost it! Fear and anger reduce the sense of agency: a study using intentional binding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How having children, and their level of education, can affect health in old age</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/child-age-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting is not an easy job, but the hard work may eventually pay off. Research demonstrates that parents have lower mortality rates in old age than childless men and women. Although this finding has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-016-9421-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replicated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19351&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; and in various settings, many questions still remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to understand the causal mechanisms behind the longer survival among parents, and during what point in life this survival advantage arises. Are mothers and fathers less likely to develop diseases? Or does the advantage arise because they survive longer once a disease occurs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we answered these questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1134-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently published study&lt;/a&gt;, we took a closer look at the relationship between parenthood and health in old age. We did not only focus on mortality in general; we also examined the risk of a first hospital admission, the risk of being readmitted to hospital, and survival after hospitalization among the entire Swedish population over the age of 70 (in total 890,544 men and women). We studied how these four different outcomes were associated with the number of children per individual and with their offspring’s socioeconomic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that two findings are particularly interesting. As expected, childless men and women had higher mortality than parents in our study, but they were not at higher risk of a first hospitalization. This suggests that the advantage of having children perhaps plays out once ill health occurs rather than before. Alternatively, parents might be more likely to seek help and receive early treatment, which itself might be one reason for their longer survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era of population ageing and rising levels of childlessness, identifying care deficits could eventually contribute to reducing health disparities in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we found children’s education, but not their income, to be associated with their parents’ health, more so than the number of children itself. The protective effects of higher offspring education were strong and consistent for all parental health outcomes in our study, regardless of parents’ own socioeconomic position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortality differences between parents and non-parents should not be neglected. Holding other factors constant, we estimated that 61% of women with two children were expected to survive to age 87 (the end of our study period), while the corresponding number for childless women was 56%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference was even larger between parents whose children had only compulsory education and parents with highly educated children: we found an increase from 57% of women expected to survive to age 87 in the former group to 66% in the latter, with a similar increase for men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckz053/5443281?searchresult=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, we estimated that married women with two children are expected to survive about 16 months longer after stroke compared to childless married women. Considering that the average survival time after stroke is just 7 years, this survival advantage is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although several studies on the relationship between number of children, their socioeconomic resources, and health in late life have recently been published, most authors conclude that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953617302332&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;further&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39124-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-018-9469-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jech.bmj.com/content/71/5/424.long&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to shed light on the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes these differences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who eventually become parents might be healthier already from an early age. For instance, some people remain childless because of health problems in mid-life which could then affect mortality in old age. This would mean that having children indicates better overall health but does not contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, adult children often become caregivers for their ageing parents, even in a country like Sweden in which publicly financed health and elder care is universally available. Children might also provide emotional and informational support to their ageing parents. These forms of support may directly contribute to the better health and mortality outcomes for parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it is possible that childless adults would benefit from additional care and support in old age, regardless of the underlying causal pathways. In an era of population ageing and rising levels of childlessness, identifying such care deficits could eventually contribute to reducing health disparities in old age.&lt;/p&gt;

To get at an answer, it’s worth setting the theories aside and instead looking at just how much information &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;be learned in order to speak a language with adult proficiency, argue Francis Mollica at the University of Rochester, US, and Steven Piantadosi at the University of California, Berkeley. If the amount is vast, for instance, this could indicate that it’s impracticable for it all to be learned without sophisticated innate language mechanisms. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181393&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/i&gt;, Mollica and Piantadosi present results suggesting that some language-specific knowledge could be innate – but probably not the kind of syntactic knowledge (the grammatical rules underlying correct word order) that nativists have tended to argue in favour of. Indeed, their work suggests that the long-running focus on whether syntax is learned or innate has been misplaced.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36978&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollica and Piantadosi worked out “back-of-the-envelope” upper, lower and “best guess” estimates of how much information we have to absorb in order to acquire various aspects of language — to identify phonemes (units of sound), word-forms, and lexical semantics (the meaning of words and the relationships between them), as well as syntax, for example.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maths that they used to do this is complex. (If you’re fond of equations that span a page-width, you should definitely check theirs out.) But their fundamental approach is to compute the number of “bits” required to specify an outcome&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;— learning the meaning of a word, for example — “from a plausible space of logically possible alternatives”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, they estimate that storing essential knowledge about phonemes takes up only about 750 bits (a bit is a binary unit of information used in computing; 8 million bits is equivalent to 1 megabyte). However, a typical adult vocabulary of about 40,000 words involves perhaps about 400,000 bits of lexical knowledge. Storing information about what all these words mean is more demanding: the researchers’ best guess is somewhere in the region of 12,000,000 bits. A language-learner would also need to store about 80,000 bits of information about word frequency, they suggest.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Mollica and Piantadosi turned to syntax. “Syntax has traditionally been the battleground for debates about how much information is built-in versus learned,” they write. “In the face of massively incompatible and experimentally under-determined syntactic theories, we aim here to study the question in a way that is as independent as possible.” In fact, they estimate that we need to store only a very small amount of data about syntax — perhaps only 667 bits. According to these estimates, having innate knowledge of syntax wouldn’t be especially helpful, as acquiring it is relatively undemanding.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntactic knowledge may not require a huge amount of knowledge but the total amount of language-related information that must be stored by a proficient language speaker is massive: around 1.5 megabytes. If correct, this would mean that up until the age of 18, a child would have to remember, on average, 1000 to 2000 bits of information every day. The researchers’ very lowest estimate is that reaching adult language proficiency would require that a child learn 120 bits per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To put our lower estimate in perspective, each day for 18 years a child must wake up and remember, perfectly and for the rest of their life, an amount of information equivalent to the information in this sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;011010000110100101100100011001000110010101101110011000010110001101100011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;011011110111001001100100011010010110111101101110”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a “remarkable feat of cognition” suggests that language acquisition is grounded in “remarkably sophisticated mechanisms for learning, memory and inference,” the pair comment.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ballpark-type figures, they stress. But, even so, they argue that their estimates suggest that neither the nativist nor the empiricist approach provides a viable account of how we come to represent lexical semantics (word meanings) – which their work indicates is overwhelmingly the biggest language mountain to conquer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that if any language-specific knowledge is innate, it is most likely for helping tackle the immense challenge of learning lexical semantics, rather than other domains with learnability problems that require orders of magnitude less information,” Mollica and Piantadosi&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181393&quot;&gt;Humans store about 1.5 megabytes of information during language acquisition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Consumers assume that when they take an over-the-counter pain medication, it will relieve their physical symptoms, but they do not anticipate broader psychological effects.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latest installment of this alarmist saga, we learn that acetaminophen blunts positive empathy, i.e. the capacity to appreciate and identify with the positive emotions of others (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00538/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mischkowski et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). I'll discuss those findings another time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, let's evaluate the entire TYLENOL® oeuvre by taking a step back and examining the plausibility of the published claims. To summarize, one of the most common over-the-counter, non-narcotic, non-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug&quot;&gt;NSAID&lt;/a&gt; pain-relieving medications in existence supposedly alleviates the personal experience of hurt feelings and social pain and heartache (positive outcomes). At the same time, TYLENOL® blunts the phenomenological experiences of positive emotion and diminishes empathy for others' people's experiences, both good and bad (negative outcomes). Published articles have reported that many of these effects can be observed after ONE REGULAR DOSE of paracetamol. These findings are based on how undergraduates judge a series of hypothetical stories. One major problem (which is not specific to The Paracetamol Papers) concerns the ecological validity of laboratory tasks as measures of the cognitive and emotional constructs of interest. This issue is critical, but outside the main scope of our discussion today. More to the point, an experimental manipulation may cause a statistically significant shift in a variable of interest, but ultimately we have to decide whether a circumscribed finding in the lab has broader implications for society at large. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why TYLENOL® ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another puzzling element is, why choose acetaminophen as the exclusive pain medication of interest? Its mechanisms of action for relieving fever, headache, and other pains are unclear. Thus, the authors don't have a specific, principled reason for choosing TYLENOL® over Advil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;) or aspirin. Presumably, the effects should generalize, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For instance, ibuprofen actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/06/advil-increases-social-pain-if-youre.html&quot;&gt;Increases Social Pain&lt;/a&gt; in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analgesic effects of acetaminophen are mediated by a complex series of cellular mechanisms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). One proposed mechanism involves descending serotonergic bulbospinal pathways from the brainstem to the spinal cord. This isn't exactly Prozac territory, so the analogy between Tylenol and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SSRI antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; isn't apt. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the Cav3.2 calcium channel might also be part of the action (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). A recently recognized player is the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabinoid receptor&lt;/a&gt;. AM404, a metabolite of acetaminophen, indirectly activates CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting the breakdown and reuptake of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an endocannabinoid&quot;&gt; anandamide&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the brain  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s1600/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;281&quot; data-original-width=&quot;387&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s400/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cannabinoids, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the non-intoxicating cousin of THC &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; has a high profile now because of its soaring popularity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many ailments&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, CBD has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cbdv.200790147&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very low affinity&lt;/a&gt; for  CB&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;and&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;CB&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;receptors and may act instead via  &lt;span class=&quot;highlight selected&quot;&gt;sero&lt;/span&gt;tonergic 5-HT1A receptors {&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/41359764/Cannabidiol__Recent_Advances20160120-1921-1rxjn6j.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;amp;Expires=1556433869&amp;amp;Signature=fjs1C9zN1XpIOTs5FCsR8WmBrrY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCannabidiol_Recent_Advances.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;}, as a modulator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Μ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;μ-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Δ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;δ-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, and as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antagonist and inverse agonist&lt;/a&gt; at several G protein-coupled receptors. Most CBD use seems to be in the non-therapeutic (placebo) range, because the effective dose for, let's say, anxiety is 10-20 times higher than the average commercial product. You'd have to eat 3-6 bags of cranberry gummies for 285-570 mg of CBD (close to the 300-600 mg recommended dose). Unfortunately, you would also ingest 15-30 mg of THC, which would be quite intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&quot;the typical cup of CBD-infused coffee that you buy in your local trendy coffee shop will have, on average, 5-10 mg of CBD, which is nowhere near the therapeutic dosage [at least 300 mg] required for it to have any kind of anxiolytic effect&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1121740961774571521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Words Have Meanings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If acetaminophen were so effective in “mending broken hearts”, “easing heartaches”, and providing a “cure for a broken heart”, we would be a society of perpetually happy automatons, wiping away the suffering of breakup and divorce with a mere OTC tablet. We'd have Tylenol epidemics and Advil epidemics to rival the scourge of the present Opioid Epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, social and political discourse in the US has reached a new low. Ironically, the paracetamol “blissed-out” population is enraged because they can't identify with the feelings or opinions of the masses who are 'different' than they are. Somehow, I don't think it's from taking too much Tylenol.
