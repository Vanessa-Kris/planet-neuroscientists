	<title>Science News: Creative school plans could counter inequities exposed by COVID-19</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The emergency pivot to remote learning for K–12 students last spring illuminated longstanding educational fault lines in the United States. The most vulnerable students — children with disabilities, English language learners and children from marginalized Black, Hispanic and Native American communities — were less likely than their affluent and mostly white peers to have basic necessities such as regular meals, a quiet place to work, computer access, guidance on how to get online and even online access itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, education researchers were sounding the alarm that the country’s achievement gap between students from low- and high-income households had remained unchanged for almost half a century, with the poorest students &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/learning-gap-rich-poor-students-remains-high&quot;&gt;performing at academic levels three to four years below&lt;/a&gt; that of the wealthiest students (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;3/19/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spring’s events may have pushed disadvantaged students even further behind. In a May working paper, researchers at Brown University in Providence, R.I., used typical rates of learning loss that occur over summer vacation to estimate learning losses incurred by spring school closures. Their calculations suggest that students, on average, will return to school this fall having retained only about a third to half of the math skills acquired during a normal school year, and 63 to 68 percent of their reading skills. But those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-226&quot;&gt;learning losses are uneven&lt;/a&gt;, with readers in the top third proficiency level potentially even accelerating their rate of learning during school closures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This fall, with COVID-19 still surging throughout the country, many schools are reopening either entirely online, or with an online–in person hybrid schedule. Assuming full in-person instruction does not resume until January 2021, global consulting firm McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimates that the students may fall behind nearly seven months on average. For white students, the average is six months. In comparison, Hispanic students would be set back more than nine months, Black students more than 10 months, and low-income students, over a year. Overall, existing racial and socioeconomic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime&quot;&gt;achievement gaps could expand by 15 to 20 percent&lt;/a&gt;, the group estimates. Education researchers fear that students who suffered the greatest learning losses in the spring may never catch up.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Widening the gap&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows that virtual learning in K–12 schools this fall could widen preexisting achievement gaps in education. The global consulting company McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimates that if schools continue remote online learning until January 2021, Black, Hispanic and poor students will be set back at least nine months of education on average compared with average losses of six months for white students.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;Average lost learning time, in months, if in-school return is delayed to January 2021, by race and economic status&lt;/h6&gt;

Dorn et al/McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;achievement gaps with remote learning by demographic&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091151&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline1_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091151&quot;&gt;E. Dorn et al/McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were gaps before. Now they’re wider,” says education economist Douglas Harris of Tulane University in New Orleans. “A great accomplishment, unfortunately, would be to get back to where they were before this pandemic started.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an open letter that has now garnered around 500 signatures from education experts around the country, Harris and Katherine Strunk of Michigan State University in East Lansing outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pi-u7TJVIMVPIaGZ9QhJuT9VJ6URuvW3ki8diELwf7o/edit&quot;&gt;seven focus areas for helping the country’s most vulnerable students&lt;/a&gt;. A&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/07/28/7-research-based-recommendations-for-what-schools-should.html&quot;&gt; version of the letter&lt;/a&gt; appeared in &lt;em&gt;Education Week. &lt;/em&gt;Topping the list were state- and federal-level asks: A massive infusion of funds to stave off looming school budget cuts and provision of computer and internet access for all students. The other items focus on what schools can do with those resources.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But with large-scale government assistance unlikely, school districts have to figure out what they can do on shoestring budgets, using best available evidence. Solutions include boosting technology access for students, leveraging low-tech, community-based efforts, tutoring and special provisions for the youngest learners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Bridging the digital divide&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Best estimates suggest that 10 to 20 percent of students lacked access to devices such as tablets or computers, the internet or both, during the spring shift to online instruction. Hispanic, Black, low-income and rural students were most likely to lack access. An April survey from the Washington, D.C.–based Pew Research Center found that some 43 percent of low-income students would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/04/30/53-of-americans-say-the-internet-has-been-essential-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/&quot;&gt;likely have to complete their homework on a cell phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some school districts quickly mobilized to bridge that digital divide. In Guilford County, N.C., where over 66 percent of the district’s 71,000-plus students live in poverty, two local nonprofits joined forces to purchase laptops for thousands of students. Additionally, the district used money from the CARES Act, a federal coronavirus relief fund, to buy almost 80,000 devices for students, staff and teachers for fall. But back orders nationwide mean half the items might arrive late, a school spokesperson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, and again this fall, the district rolled out “smart” buses with Wi-Fi hot spots in areas without reliable internet access. Each of the 125 buses can support 65 simultaneous connections, with the signal extending over 90 meters. The $1,000 apiece price tag to outfit the buses was covered by a grant from Chiefs for Change, a bipartisan group of school leaders headquartered in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guilford County smart bus with wi-fi&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091152&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline2_680-677x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091152&quot;&gt;The shift to online learning in spring due to COVID-19 meant that students needed to watch classes online. Many students in North Carolina’s Guilford County schools lacked internet access so the district rolled out “smart” buses capable of supporting 65 simultaneous connections. Here, a school employee tests the setup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091152&quot;&gt;Chris English/Tigermoth Creative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other districts have received support from state and local governments. City leaders joined Chicago Public Schools and philanthropic groups in creating Chicago Connected, a $50 million initiative to provide 100,000 students with free high-speed internet for four years. Over 18,000 students had signed up before fall classes started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond internet access, just taking steps to make sure students show up online has helped ensure access. Leaders in Florida’s Miami-Dade County Public Schools experienced with unpredictable school closures thanks to hurricanes, went door-to-door with the help of local police and community partners to check on absent students and provide them with devices and hot spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guilford and Miami-Dade reported that in some weeks, over 90 percent of students logged on to classes, though average attendance trended lower. Even the basic act of taking attendance sets those districts apart, says Bree Dusseault, an education researcher at the Seattle-based Center for Reinventing Public Education, a nonpartisan public school reform research group affiliated with the University of Washington Bothell. Among the more than 100 schools — serving almost 10 million students — in the center’s database, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WLwHgQvoWT1op6RALANmwOE7akFfDEJGbKLeXEQnEes/edit&quot;&gt;only a third of districts tracked attendance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What works in urban and suburban districts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2020/08/10/rural-school-districts-can-be-creative-in-solving-the-internet-connectivity-gap-but-they-need-support/&quot;&gt;doesn’t always translate well to rural areas&lt;/a&gt; without high-speed internet infrastructure, according to a report from the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. In those cases, lower-tech workarounds can help students keep up. One Ohio district uploaded videos onto USB drives and hand-delivered them to students. Elsewhere, teachers called students on the phone to check on their progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Pandemic pods, community education and tutoring&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some parents have banded together in so-called pandemic pods to teach their kids, sometimes with the help of a paid tutor or teacher. This model has attracted media attention in part because of its potential to worsen inequities, since not everyone can afford to hire an educator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But single mom Yenda Prado has a positive outlook on pods, which she first experienced during summer visits to her grandmother’s village in Mexico. There, community pods formed for exchanging services such as English lessons and housekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When families and communities are in crisis, that’s when they come together to pool and share resources,” says Prado, a fifth-year doctoral student in education at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;school pod in California due to COVID-19&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091153&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline3_680-670x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091153&quot;&gt;After the pivot to online learning in March due to the novel coronavirus, single mom and education researcher Yenda Prado, of the University of California, Irvine, created a small learning group, or pod, with her son (far right) and some of his classmates. Now she is working to create pods within area K–12 schools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091153&quot;&gt;Kathleen Adler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She created a pilot pod with her 9-year-old son and some classmates in June, and is assessing how to scale up that setup through her affiliation with the Orange County Educational Advancement Network, or OCEAN. The consortium encompasses some area K–12 schools, various nonprofits and UC Irvine. Prado’s goal is to connect small groups of students at OCEAN’s affiliate schools with undergraduate “fellows.” Those fellows will receive service or field study credit for their work, or simply volunteer. Fellows can provide academic support, but their main role is facilitating member bonding and community building. “That is what’s missing from the educational landscape right now,” Prado says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such strengthening of ties between community organizations and schools could present a chance for educators to make learning resonate with students of all backgrounds. Research shows, for instance, that when curriculum is made ethnically relevant for students, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/my-brother%E2%80%99s-keeper-impact-targeted-educational-supports&quot;&gt;dropout rates go down and grades and attendance go up&lt;/a&gt;.  Even when such programs exist outside of school, such as through community-run after-school programs, they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=21990&quot;&gt;help students integrate what they’re learning at school with their lived experiences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This moment … as sad as it is, I think it’s a great opportunity for education to not only be reclaimed by communities, but for schools to recognize that they’re not the only places of learning and development, and they have to be able to do this together,” says community-based education researcher Bianca Baldridge of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Community and faith-based organizations and local funders in Indianapolis rose to the occasion by creating a learning hub that gives priority to students who struggled with low attendance in the spring, and those experiencing homelessness. And San Francisco’s Parks and Recreation Department is partnering with area nonprofits to provide 6,000 childcare spots for children in grades K–6, with priority given to students in greatest need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, districts are pursuing tutoring models to provide personalized in-person or remote academic support. Just over a tenth of districts in the Center for Reinventing Public Education’s database are looking into such plans, Dusseault says. The Los Angeles Unified School District, which is all-online this fall, is providing 500 K–8 students with free tutors, who are volunteers with a group called Step Up Tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matching struggling students with tutors 1-to-1 or 2-to-1 is a surefire way to help close opportunity gaps, says Matthew Kraft, a Brown University education economics researcher. Tutoring works best during the school day, he has found. A July working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27476.pdf&quot;&gt;substantial learning gains among participants in 96 programs&lt;/a&gt; lasting 10 weeks to a year, with mostly low, often 1-to-1, student-tutor ratios. A nationwide tutoring corps could be rolled out by expanding Americorps, a federally funded national service program, Kraft and others suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Prioritizing in-person learning for younger children&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the youngest students, in-person instruction makes sense from both public health and education standpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For reasons that are not entirely clear, younger children appear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks&quot;&gt;less likely than older children and adults to transmit the virus&lt;/a&gt; that causes COVID-19 (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;8/4/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a July policy brief, education researchers Kathleen Lynch of Brown University and Heather Hill of Harvard University point to&lt;a href=&quot;https://annenberg.brown.edu/sites/default/files/EdResearch_for_Recovery_Brief_6.pdf&quot;&gt; multiple lines of evidence supporting in-person instruction for younger students&lt;/a&gt;. Learning growth rates are substantially higher in grades K–2 than in later grades, and failure to understand the building blocks of numeracy and literacy in those early years can lead to academic difficulties later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;young children wearing masks in school due to COVID-19&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091154&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_sg_covid-school_inline4_680-675x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091154&quot;&gt;Virtual learning is especially hard for elementary school–age children, researchers say. As such, many districts across the United States are working to bring the youngest children into physical classrooms before older students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091154&quot;&gt;FatCamera//E+/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, very young students do not generally possess the attention and self-regulation skills needed for all-online instruction. Even when those students have computers and internet access, online classes remain a challenge, says Chris Curran, an education policy expert at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Young children can’t reasonably be expected to pay attention to online classes for hours on end, or complete simple tasks, such as writing their name on a piece of paper, without adult assistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some school districts are trying to bring younger kids into physical classrooms before older kids. For instance, Kansas City Public Schools will start entirely online September 8, but if the city sees a 14-day decline in COVID-19 cases and city health officials OK school reopening, youngsters in grades K–3 can return in person full-time. After another 14-day decline, students in grades 4 to 8 can return part-time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When opening in person is just not an option, Curran says districts must adapt to younger students’ needs, such as by handing out art project materials. “Technology can’t be the only solution, particularly for really young students,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: When We Follow Orders To Hurt Someone, We Feel Their Pain Less Than If We Hurt Them Freely</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/07/when-we-follow-orders-to-hurt-someone-we-feel-their-pain-less-than-if-we-hurt-them-freely/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the best-known and also controversial experiments in psychology: in 1963, Stanley Milgram reported that, when instructed, many people are surprisingly willing to deliver apparently dangerous electrical shocks to others. For some researchers, this — along with follow-up studies by the team — reveals how acting “under orders” can undermine our moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milgram’s interpretation of his findings, and the methods, too, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/&quot;&gt;have been criticised&lt;/a&gt;. However, the results have largely been replicated in experiments run in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/news-and-media&quot;&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/&quot;&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere. And in 2016, a brain-scanning study revealed that when we perform an act under coercion vs freely, our brain processes it more like a passive action rather than a voluntary one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a new study, from a group that specialises in the neuroscience of empathy, takes this further: Emilie Caspar at the Social Brain Lab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and colleagues report in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; that when we follow orders to hurt someone, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307370?via=ihub&quot;&gt;reduced activity in brain networks involved in our ability to feel another’s pain&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, this leads us to perceive pain that we inflict as being less severe. This process could, then, help to explain the dark side of obedience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40226&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most of the 40 participants recruited for the new work were women, and their average age was about 25. None knew each other before arriving at the lab, where they were studied in gender-matched pairs. Within each pair, one person was randomly chosen to first be the “agent”, and the other the “victim” (they would later switch roles). The agent was taken to an MRI scanner in one room, while the victim was seated in another, electrodes attached to their hand. While in the scanner, the agent could see a live video of the victim’s hand, so they could observe the (genuine) impact of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The task itself was split into four blocks of 30 trials each. During two of the blocks, the agent was told “you can decide” whether or not to press a button to inflict a mildly painful electrical shock to the victim. During the other two blocks, half the time they were given the instruction “Shock”, and half the time “No Shock”. Each shock the agent gave was “rewarded” with €0.05.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that, on average, people were less likely to administer a shock when it was up to them. (Still, the number of shocks was not negligible: an average of 23 out of the 60 “you decide” trials vs 30 of the 60 instructed trials. Statistically, there’s a significant difference between the two figures, but there clearly isn’t a chasm.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caspar and her colleagues used the brain imaging data to look closely at three distinct patterns of activity: the “vicarious pain signature” (associated with feeling other people’s pain); the “neurologic pain signature” (associated with experiencing pain directly) and the “interpersonal guilt signature” (observable when we feel guilt over a harmful impact on another person). The team found that when someone was obeying orders to administer a shock, rather than choosing to do so, both the vicarious pain signature and the interpersonal guilt signature were less intense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tallying with the brain imaging results, the participants reported feeling less bad, and less sorry, about inflicting pain when acting under orders — and they reported that these shocks looked less severe on the video. As the researchers note, this was despite the fact that the participants had been told the shocks would always be of the same intensity. “Obeying orders has such a strong influence on the perception of pain felt by others that it even impacts perceptual reports of observed shock intensity,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All in all, the results imply that when we’re acting under orders to hurt someone, we don’t find it as personally unpleasant as when we hurt someone freely. Part of the reason we normally don’t hurt other people is because we’d feel at least some of their pain ourselves, but when obeying orders this vicarious response is reduced — so we’re more likely to harm them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team argues that a sense of responsibility and/or agency (feeling that we are the author of our own actions) is key: when these are reduced, so too is our empathy for pain that we inflict, with potentially dire results. The results “highlight how obeying an order relaxes our aversion against harming others, despite still being the author of the action that led to the pain,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But why might this happen? Is there something more fundamental going on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that in this study — as in other similar studies — the participants were acting under the clear orders of an authority figure with an electric shock machine at their disposal. As for all living things, our prime directives are to survive and thrive. Imagine in the real world being ordered by someone in authority to harm another person. You might recognise (even unconsciously) that your choice is either to obey, or disobey and risk being hurt yourself — either physically, or in terms of your career. An evolved ability to dial down your empathy for someone else’s pain in such a situation could be of benefit to you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307370?via=ihub&quot;&gt;Obeying orders reduces vicarious brain activation towards victims’ pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: How next-gen computer generated maps detect partisan gerrymandering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091015</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gerrymandering-elections-next-gen-computer-generated-maps</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, a state court determined that North Carolina’s congressional districts had been severely gerrymandered and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/2019-10-28-Harper%20v_%20Lewis-Order.pdf&quot;&gt;struck down the state’s map&lt;/a&gt;. The court’s ruling was informed, in part, by tens of thousands of alternative maps demonstrating that the district boundaries had very likely been manipulated for political gain, the very definition of gerrymandering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers had generated a slew of alternative, computer-generated maps designed to help identify potential patterns of bias. The approach is increasingly used, alongside other tests, to ferret out alleged gerrymandering. District manipulations can be so subtle that they’re undetectable just by looking at them. “The eyeball test is no good,” says Jonathan Katz, a political scientist and statistician at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;U.S. states redraw their district lines every 10 years to adjust for changing demographics picked up by the national census. The last round a decade ago raised eyebrows, most notably for districts drawn in Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The post-2010 round of redistricting is widely viewed as a time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12744&quot;&gt;extreme, even egregious, partisan gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;,” retired political scientist Richard Engstrom wrote in the January 2020 &lt;em&gt;Social Science Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A 2017 report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that existing congressional maps were largely biased in favor of the Republican Party. In 26 states, which account for 85 percent of U.S. congressional districts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Extreme Maps 5.16_0.pdf&quot;&gt;as many as 17 Republicans in the House of Representatives owe their seats to gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;. In states where Democrats controlled the redistricting process, partisan bias is also a problem, but the effect is smaller because those states are often made up of fewer districts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, legal scholars, political scientists and mathematicians conducting gerrymandering research have served as expert witnesses in more than 250 state and federal court cases regarding redistricting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the 2020 U.S. census now under way, legislators will soon be revising electoral districts again. This time around, researchers hope that instead of serving as expert witnesses in court, they can help identify problematic districting before the new maps even go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2010, the politicians were thinking very hard on how to draw maps,” while the public and academics weren’t paying a lot of attention, says Jon Eguia, an applied game theorist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. “So in 2011, [those politicians] drew a lot of very bad maps in very many states. Now we’re all paying attention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Measuring bias&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a state’s voting districts must each contain about the same number of people and be drawn in a way that doesn’t disenfranchise racial or ethnic minorities. States can have additional rules, such as contiguity of districts or that cities or counties be kept intact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That leaves two main tactics for gerrymandering: “packing” the opposing political party’s supporters into a few districts in hopes your party dominates the rest, or “cracking” these supporters by spreading them across many districts to dilute their collective voting power. Those skilled in gerrymandering draw district boundaries that ensure decade-long protection for the ruling party.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early methods to test a state map for gerrymandering, which are still in use today, rely on a concept known as partisan symmetry. If a map provides symmetric, or equal, opportunity for all parties in a contest to convert votes into seats, that map is deemed fair. States with packed and cracked districts won’t pass tests based on symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Puzzle power &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The party that controls the maps can grab power through packing or cracking. In packing, politicians cram voters from the opposing party into just a few districts, securing the remaining districts for their own party. The blue ruling party created one all-red district, and three majority blue districts. In cracking, politicians spread voters from the opposing party across districts, blocking them from gaining a majority. The ruling red party split up blue voters at the “city center” to create three reliably red districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symmetry-based tests gained prominence after&lt;em&gt; LULAC v. Perry&lt;/em&gt;, a 2006 Supreme Court case that reviewed a mid-decade redistricting plan in Texas. In that case, scientists entered into evidence a partisan bias test — a simulation of what would have happened in an election if the parties’ vote shares were reversed. For instance, if Party A wins 10 out of 15 seats with 70 percent of the vote in an actual election, then Party B, in a hypothetical election, should win 10 seats if it had 70 percent of the vote. Deviation from that “symmetry” equals the level of partisan bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;LULAC&lt;/em&gt;, the justices largely upheld Texas’ map. But the court indicated willingness to use a symmetry-based method in a future case, though perhaps not solely the partisan bias test. Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concerns about that particular test, saying it was unclear how much bias was too much. Kennedy also questioned the method’s reliance on statistical simulations rather than real-world results. “We are wary of adopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs,” he wrote in the plurality opinion for &lt;em&gt;LULAC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Real-world symmetry&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s feedback on &lt;em&gt;LULAC&lt;/em&gt; prompted researchers to develop other symmetry-based tests that used actual election results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One such approach is the median-mean difference test. That test arises from the basic statistical principle that the difference between the median and the mean indicates the level of skew in the data, with values closer to zero less skewed and vice versa. In 2015 in the &lt;em&gt;Election Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;, political scientists Michael McDonald and Robin Best of Binghamton University in New York explained how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/McDonald_Best_Unfair_Gerrymanders_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;median-mean analysis could help identify partisan skew in a state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A party’s mean vote share comes from averaging vote shares across all districts in a state. A party’s median vote share comes from the district in the middle of a distribution, with the party’s worst-performing district in terms of vote share at one end and the best-performing district at the other. If the difference between a party’s median and mean vote shares is high, that indicates a possibly biased skew, though McDonald and Best noted that some natural skew is inevitable and must be factored into any analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another approach is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol82/iss2/4/&quot;&gt;efficiency gap&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the difference in packing and cracking between parties by tallying “wasted” votes. So, if Party A draws an electoral map that spreads Party B’s voters across districts, votes cast for Candidate B in districts won by A are wasted. Conversely, if Party A packs Party B’s voters into a few districts, votes cast for Candidate B beyond the majority needed to win are also wasted. Each party should have about the same number of wasted votes in an election. So the efficiency gap, first described in 2015 in the&lt;em&gt; University of Chicago Law Review&lt;/em&gt;, is calculated by taking the difference in wasted votes between parties and dividing that by the total number of votes cast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PlanScore, a nonpartisan group of legal, political and mapping experts, has shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://planscore.org/north_carolina/#!2012-plan-ushouse-pb&quot;&gt;how the various symmetry tests can be used in tandem&lt;/a&gt; to flag possible gerrymandering. In its analysis of the congressional map used in North Carolina’s 2018 congressional elections, where Republicans won 10 seats and Democrats three, PlanScore found bias using all three tests: The partisan bias test showed that in a hypothetical, tied election, Republicans would win 26.9 percent extra seats. In the median-mean test, the median Republican vote share was 5.8 percent higher than its mean vote share. And the efficiency gap was 27.7 percent in favor of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Natural advantage&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics of symmetry-based tests, though, say that the presence of packing and cracking does not prove that the governing party has intentionally gerrymandered the state’s districts. Instead, asymmetries can also arise from natural variations in where voters live. Crucially, Republicans tend to be more dispersed across states while Democrats are concentrated in cities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The party that’s more spread out has a geographic advantage,” says applied mathematician Jonathan Mattingly of Duke University. “That’s our system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests that have emerged over the last few years, known broadly as ensemble methods, accept that natural advantage. These tests rely on computers to generate thousands, or even millions, of possible maps. The programs draw myriad boundary lines around a given district and estimate which party would win that district under each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider a state in which one party wins four to seven seats in almost all maps generated, while the state is using a map that regularly gives that party nine seats, Eguia says. That discrepancy suggests partisan gerrymandering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers working on gerrymandering cases tend to use ensemble and symmetry methods in tandem, says Ruth Greenwood, an attorney in Cambridge, Mass., with PlanScore and the nonpartisan nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. That’s because each alternative map can also be evaluated for symmetry using the various tests. Averaging symmetry scores in the ensemble maps and comparing those values with the symmetry scores of the real-life map can illuminate when the difference is stark and therefore can’t be chalked up to any “natural advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using all methods together also means that when a map’s fairness is questioned, the lawyers can show that “on any metric, the result is terrible,” Greenwood says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;States at the helm&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of gerrymandering was weaving through the federal courts until June 2019, when the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in &lt;em&gt;Rucho v. Common Cause &lt;/em&gt;that partisan gerrymandering fell outside federal jurisdiction. The decision was in response to an appeal challenging a federal court’s January 2018 ruling that North Carolina’s congressional district map had been gerrymandered along partisan lines, giving Republicans 10 out of 13 seats in 2016 and 2018, despite the fact that in both elections Republicans won only about half the popular vote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By removing the federal court system from gerrymandering cases, the Supreme Court left the issue to the states, a charge a North Carolina state court quickly took up in&lt;em&gt; Harper v. Lewis&lt;/em&gt;. The state court relied on much of the same evidence presented in &lt;em&gt;Rucho&lt;/em&gt;. That evidence included testimony by Mattingly showing that in a universe with 24,518 alternative congressional district maps, the map North Carolina was using was an egregious outlier. In the maps Mattingly generated, Republicans carried 10 or more seats less than 1 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, the three-judge panel in the &lt;em&gt;Harper&lt;/em&gt; case ruled that state lawmakers needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/2019-10-28-Harper%20v_%20Lewis-Order.pdf&quot;&gt;redraw the congressional district map for 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Plaintiffs, however, then challenged the state’s remedial map, which would likely result in Republicans winning eight out of 13 seats. Mattingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/files/2019/12/Mattingly-Nov.-26-Declaration.pdf&quot;&gt;again provided expert testimony&lt;/a&gt;, this time adding 57,202 more maps made using less stringent constraints than the first batch. His research showed a much more purple state, with a 7–6 or 6–7 party split arising in the majority of those alternative maps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But with the state’s 2020 primary fast approaching, a state court approved the remedial map in December 2019. That new map will stand for only a short time, though. Along with every other state, North Carolina will go through redistricting again in 2021 after the census tallies are in. New Jersey and Virginia — which hold statewide elections in odd years — may struggle to finish their maps before the 2021 elections, since the census was delayed due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slightly fairer &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the last decade, Republican legislators in North Carolina have strategically packed and cracked Democratic voters across congressional districts, limiting their voting power. A state court struck down the maps from 2016 and 2018 that created only three Democratic-leaning districts (blue). The 2020 map creates two more blue-leaning districts, but researchers say the new map still gives Republicans an extra one or two seats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, census watchers worry that the Trump administration’s recent decision to move the completion deadline for the population count from October 31 to September 30 could lead to undercounts among hard-to-reach groups, thereby affecting the placement of district boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greenwood expects a spike in lawsuits, though now at the state rather than federal level, challenging the newly drawn maps. And a small cadre of researchers is now ready to serve as expert witnesses in those cases, Eguia says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The upcoming mapmaking process doesn’t have to repeat the mistakes of a decade ago, he adds. In 2011, lawmakers drew maps largely behind closed doors without researchers present — resulting in a decade of lawsuits, he says. Why not, instead, bring researchers into the room, with their tests and myriad maps, from the get-go? “That’s what the community of experts would prefer,” he says. “That’s what I would advocate for.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Protecting half the planet could help solve climate change and save species</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091172</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protecting-half-planet-climate-change-save-species</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earth faces two interrelated crises: accelerating loss of biodiversity and climate change. Both are worsened by human development of natural lands that would otherwise allow species to flourish and would store atmosphere-warming carbon, stabilizing the climate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study argues that nations can help avert the biodiversity and climate crises by preserving the roughly 50 percent of land that remains relatively undeveloped. The researchers dub that conserved area a “Global Safety Net,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabb2824&quot;&gt;mapping out regions that can meet critical conservation and climate goals&lt;/a&gt; in a study published September 4 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eric Dinerstein, a conservation biologist at RESOLVE, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., and colleagues began by mapping out existing protected areas, which cover about 15 percent of land. The team then sequentially added slices of land needed to meet different conservation goals, using existing biodiversity databases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect species most threatened by extinction that aren’t already protected, an extra 2.3 percent of land would need to be set aside. The researchers also identified new areas that could preserve hot spots of exceptional species diversity, and large tracts of wilderness needed to support wide-ranging animals like caribou. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Much of the land identified as important for biodiversity also stores a lot of carbon, underlining the connection between conservation and climate goals. But the researchers found an additional 4.7 percent of land, including forests in the northeastern United States, that would help keep climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Global safety net&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After mapping established protected areas, which account for 15 percent of Earth’s land, researchers sequentially calculated how much more land needs protecting to meet different goals. Preserving rare species not already protected would require 2.3 percent more land. To conserve additional areas with exceptional biodiversity, an additional 6 percent needs protecting. An extra 6.3 percent of land is needed for “rare phenomena,” unique areas that support large mammals, like the Pantanal region in South America where jaguars roam. And 16 percent more would be needed to conserve large tracts of wilderness that support wide-ranging species like caribou. Finally, an additional 4.7 percent of land could be set aside for storing carbon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Where land needs to be protected to achieve conservation and climate goals&lt;/h6&gt;

Dinerstein et al/Science Advances 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091176&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_jl_conservation-map_inline_mobile_680_REV.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091176&quot;&gt;E. Dinerstein et al/Science Advances 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Providing some level of protection or sustainable management for these lands could achieve various climate and conservation goals, the researchers argue. But Dinerstein says nations must act much faster than they are to protect these areas. Currently, governments are drafting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-will-protecting-30-percent-earth-prevent-extinction-crisis&quot;&gt;plans to protect 30 percent of the globe by 2030&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/22/20&lt;/em&gt;). “That’s not fast enough,” he says. “We have to achieve a whole lot more in a decade than what people are arguing for.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study adds to the “nature vs nurture” debate about the fusiform face area, a region of the brain specialised for processing faces, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/face-selectivity-in-the-blind-brain&quot;&gt;reports Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers found that both blind and sighted people show activation of this area when touching models of faces, suggesting that visual experience, at least, isn’t necessary for the area to become specialised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40206&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans have prospered as a species because of our “friendliness”, such as our tendency to perform acts of kindness towards other members of our in-group — even those we don’t know&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the argument made at &lt;em&gt;Science Focus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/survival-of-the-friendliest-why-kindness-not-aggression-helped-humans-thrive/&quot;&gt;by Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods&lt;/a&gt;, who have a book out called “Survival of the Friendliest”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people worry that wearing a mask prevents us from conveying our emotions to others. &lt;/strong&gt;But our eyes reveal a surprising amount of information about our mental states, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/face-masks-why-your-eyes-might-be-saying-more-than-you-realise-145076&quot;&gt;writes Nigel Holt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having high self-control is associated with a range of positive outcomes, such as better academic performance and a healthier lifestyle. But it’s not all good, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200827-how-self-control-can-actually-unleash-your-dark-side&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Worklife&lt;/em&gt;. People high in self-control may be more likely to behave selfishly — if they know they can get away with it — and follow orders to perform immoral actions like grinding up insects and giving others electric shocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s it like to struggle to recognise family and friends? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Guardian, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/30/my-face-blindness-is-embarrassing-but-it-tells-me-a-lot-about-other-people&quot;&gt;Katherine May has written a poignant account&lt;/a&gt; of her experience with face blindness&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk showcased his much-hyped Neuralink implants last week, with a demonstration of how the device can record neuronal activity from the cortex of pigs and wirelessly broadcast it to a computer. &lt;/strong&gt;The technology behind the implants is impressive but not exactly new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elon-musks-pig-brain-implant-is-still-a-long-way-from-solving-paralysis/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;writes Tanya Lewis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American —&lt;/em&gt; it draws on decades of advancements in the field. The company hopes that one day the implants could help people with paralysis, though there are still plenty of hurdles to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More research is out this week about the emotional toll of the coronavirus pandemic &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; and it’s not good news. &lt;/strong&gt;In the United States, the number of people experiencing symptoms of depression is three times higher than it was pre-pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/02/908551297/pandemics-emotional-hammer-hits-hard?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;reports Rhitu Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. People on low incomes or who’ve lost jobs or loved ones are at particularly high risk.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: This parasitic plant eavesdrops on its host to know when to flower</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091011</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasitic-dodder-plant-eavesdrops-host-flower</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A dodder plant begins its life looking like a tapeworm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tiny plant, which will never grow leaves or roots, elongates in a spindly spiral. Round and round it swirls, searching for a host plant. When the dodder finds one, it latches on and infiltrates the host with tiny tubes that siphon off water and nutrients. The parasitic dodder grows, eventually covering its victim in a tangled, threadlike web of orange or yellow stems. Then, when the host plant flowers, so does the dodder, setting the stage for the sinister cycle to begin again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that last part, reproduction, has remained a mystery. Normally, flowering plants use their leaves to sense when the environmental conditions are right to flower. So how does a parasitic plant with no leaves sense when to flower? By eavesdropping, a new study shows, using a chemical signal from the dodder’s host as its own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Australian dodder plants (&lt;em&gt;Cuscuta australis&lt;/em&gt;) absorb the chemical that triggers flowering, a protein called Flowering Locus T, or FT, from their hosts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/27/2009445117&quot;&gt;use it to flower synchronously&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report August 31 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. This synchronization maximizes the dodder’s growth and reproduction, and may be part of why the plant parasite, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasitic-plant-gets-more-meal&quot;&gt;which consists of over 100 different species&lt;/a&gt;, has spread around the world, parasitizing organisms as different as alfalfa and acacia trees (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/23/08&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Australian dodder plant wrapped around a soybean plant&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091021&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090220_jl_dodder_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091021&quot;&gt;An Australian dodder plant (&lt;em&gt;Cuscuta australis&lt;/em&gt;) wraps around a soybean host plant in a laboratory. The parasite is flowering in conjunction with its host and has already begun producing seed capsules. New research suggests that dodders may use a flowering signal from their hosts to induce their own reproduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091021&quot;&gt;Jingxiong Zhang/Kunming Institute of Botany/Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Synchronizing flowering really makes sense for these plant parasites,” says Jianqiang Wu, a botanist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Kunming Institute of Botany. If a dodder flowers too soon, it won’t grow as large as it could have and will produce fewer seeds. Too late and its host may have already died, leaving the dodder with less nutrients to support flowering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wu previously demonstrated that dodders &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31812691/&quot;&gt;exchange many chemical signals with their hosts&lt;/a&gt;, and had a hunch that the parasites might be picking up on a flowering signal from hosts. So in a laboratory greenhouse, the researchers let three species of dodders loose on plants with different flowering times, confirming that all the parasites shifted their flowering time to match their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the researchers experimentally disabled a host’s FT gene, dodders no longer flowered. Then, the team attached a fluorescent protein to the host’s flowering protein and saw it glow in Australian dodder tissues, confirming that the parasites were taking up the chemical cue. The flowering protein also interacted with flowering-related genes in the dodders, which the researchers say is further evidence that FT kick-starts the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dodder and host plant synchronization has never been so clearly shown as in this paper,” says James Westwood, a plant pathologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. But there might still be more to the story, he says. “There are examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143689369.pdf&quot;&gt;dodders flowering when their host isn’t flowering&lt;/a&gt;,” he says, so it remains unclear whether the parasites sometimes use other signals to flower. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it turns out that dodders truly use only FT from hosts to induce flowering, Westwood says that would be a simple and elegant example of how evolution has entwined plant parasites with the organisms they depend on for survival. But he thinks more research is needed. “Biology is rarely that simple.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Strict new guidelines lay out a path to heritable human gene editing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091112</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-germline-gene-editing-crispr-strict-new-guidelines</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene editing to make heritable changes in human DNA isn’t yet safe and effective enough to make gene-edited babies, an international scientific commission says. But in a Sept. 3 report, the group laid out a road map for rolling out heritable gene editing should society decide that kind of DNA alteration is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing formed after a Chinese scientist announced in 2018 that he had created two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-scientists-raise-ethical-questions-first-crispr-gene-edited-babies&quot;&gt;gene-edited baby girls&lt;/a&gt;, sparking outrage (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/27/18&lt;/em&gt;). In its first official weigh-in on the issue, the group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25665/heritable-human-genome-editing&quot;&gt;lays out strict scientific criteria&lt;/a&gt; that would need to be met before heritable gene editing could be tried clinically. If countries can’t ensure that all of those criteria are met, heritable gene editing shouldn’t be approved, the commissioners say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, some critics charge that even presenting such criteria is premature. The science should wait until society decides whether to allow gene editing that can affect future generations, they say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gene editing involves changing a single DNA letter, or base, in a gene. Many different technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-spinoff-gene-editor-causes-unintended-typos-dna&quot;&gt;base editors&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/5/19&lt;/em&gt;) and engineered proteins called zinc finger nucleases and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-helps-baby-battle-cancer&quot;&gt;TALENs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/6/15&lt;/em&gt;), can be used to make edits at precise locations in DNA. Although accuracy of editing has improved, there are still concerns that gene editors will make unwanted, “off-target” changes elsewhere in DNA that might cause harm. Technologies to ensure every cell in an embryo contains the desired change — and only that change — also still need work, the commission says. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It’s accurate and efficient enough to do in animals,” but editing in human embryos requires much more precision, Haoyi Wang, a geneticist and molecular and stem cell biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology in Beijing said September 3 during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/09-03-2020/international-commission-on-the-clinical-use-of-human-germline-genome-editing-report-release-webinar&quot;&gt;a webinar&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;testing CRISPR gene editing&lt;/a&gt; to correct the inherited blood disorders sickle-cell anemia and beta-thalassemia and an inherited form of blindness called Leber congenital amaurosis 10 in adults (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/14/19&lt;/em&gt;). Those edits are in adult cells and can’t be carried into future generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sickle red blood cell&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091116&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_ts_germline_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091116&quot;&gt;Sickle-cell disease is a serious genetic disorder that that might be corrected by gene editing. The disease is caused by a mutation in gene that produces hemoglobin, which leads red blood cells to buckle. These cells sometimes clog vessels and cause painful, debilitating and life-threatening tissue damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091116&quot;&gt;EM Unit, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus, Wellcome Images/Wikimedia Commons (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But altering DNA in the human germ line — embryos, eggs, sperm or the cells that give rise to them — would create changes that could be passed on to future generations. Many people, including scientists, are concerned that rogue scientists wouldn’t stop at editing out diseases and would create “designer babies” with enhanced athletic ability, intelligence or other desirable traits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The commission proposes that human germline editing should be restricted to serious genetic diseases caused by specific versions of single genes that are virtually guaranteed to cause the disease if inherited. Such disorders include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. Children who inherit these disorders die young or have serious medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The commission also specified that before human germline editing is considered, no other way of ensuring a couple can produce embryos without the disease-causing genetic variants should be available. That essentially winnows the eligible list down to couples in which both parents have two copies of recessive disease-causing variants, or couples in which one parent has two copies of mutations that cause a dominant genetic disorder, such as Huntington’s disease, which results from inheriting a single copy of a faulty gene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 20 families around the world would meet these strict criteria, Michèle Ramsay, a human geneticist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said September 3 during a news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the commission also decided that some families with less serious disorders, but who have little chance of producing embryos without the disease-causing variants, would also be eligible. One example is familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited form of high cholesterol which leads to early heart disease and death. That and other disorders are carried by a high proportion of people in parts of the world where marriage between cousins is common. Gene editing might be an option when 25 percent or fewer of a couple’s embryos would be free of the disease-causing mutation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even then, such couples must already have attempted in vitro fertilization with a technique called preimplantation genetic testing to screen out embryos that carry the faulty version of the gene. “We’re not thinking there are going to be a lot of people” that are qualified to take part in the initial research, Ramsay said. “There are no floodgates that are going to be opened.” If the technology is both safe and effective in those few families, it might then be considered for other conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The commission recommends more research on using stem cells to produce eggs and sperm in lab dishes, which could then be used to create embryos that don’t carry genetic diseases. Such research has been done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transplanted-stem-cells-become-eggs-sterile-mice&quot;&gt;in mice&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/17&lt;/em&gt;), but is in its infancy with human cells, said Richard Lifton, a human geneticist at the Rockefeller University in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heading off hubris was one of the commission’s main concerns, Lifton said. The report also recommends establishing an international scientific advisory board to evaluate the state of the technology and consult on applications to do such heritable or germline editing.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An organization similar to the World Anti-Doping Agency, which oversees use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, might be set up to keep an eye out for unauthorized gene editing, Lifton suggested. Reining in rogue scientists would also require setting up a way for whistleblowers to report possible unapproved research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report is “appropriately cautious and thoughtful and written with a clear appreciation for what’s been going on in the world,” said Kyle Orwig, an infertility researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved with the commission. “It’s a bit aspirational because it raises questions about whether individual countries are willing to submit to international oversight,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, setting up global governance to prevent scientists from going rogue may not be as effective as laying out a clear moratorium or ban, says Katie Hasson, program director for genetic justice at the nonprofit Center for Genetics and Society, based in Berkeley, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether to allow changes to DNA that can be inherited by future generations is a decision that affects the whole human species, and should be an international consensus rather than a single country’s decision, Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This report handled only the scientific aspects of gene editing. An upcoming report from the World Health Organization will tackle ethical and societal issues surrounding gene editing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hashing out how to do germline editing before society has indicated its desire to do so is backward, Hasson says. “The question has been and still is whether we want to move forward with editing the genes and traits of future generations,” she says. “To skip ahead to how . . . seems like getting ahead of things a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is still a need for broad societal conversations about the technology. More than 70 countries already have laws that prohibit germline editing, and a moratorium and other laws might effectively stop the technology from moving forward, Hasson says. “There’s no reason this should be inevitable. Laying out this path in advance makes it seem more inevitable and pushes us toward that conclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: A weirdly warped planet-forming disk circles a distant trio of stars</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091083</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weird-warped-planet-forming-disk-orbits-three-stars</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In one of the most complex cosmic dances astronomers have yet spotted, three rings of gas and dust circle a trio of stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The star system GW Orionis, located about 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Orion, includes a pair of young stars locked in a close do-si-do with a third star making loops around both. Around all three stars is a broken-apart disk of dust and gas where planets could one day form. Unlike the flat disk that gave rise to the planets in our solar system, GW Orionis’ disk consists of three loops, with a warped middle ring and an inner ring even more twisted at a jaunty angle to the other two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bizarre geometry of this system, the first known of its kind, is reported in two recent studies by two groups of astronomers. But how GW Orionis formed is a mystery, with the two teams providing competing ideas for the triple-star-and-ring system’s birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 4 study in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, astronomer Stefan Kraus of the University of Exeter in England and colleagues suggest that &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba4633&quot;&gt;gravitational tugs and torques from the triple-star ballet&lt;/a&gt; tore apart and deformed the primordial disk. But in a May 20 study in the&lt;em&gt; Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;, Jiaqing Bi of the University of Victoria in Canada and colleagues think that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab8eb4&quot;&gt;a newborn planet is to blame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The question is how do you actually form such systems,” says theoretical physicist Giuseppe Lodato of the University of Milan, who was not on either team. “There could be different mechanisms that could do that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have seen tilted disks of gas and dust around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tilted-binary-stars-test-theories-planet-formation&quot;&gt;binary star systems&lt;/a&gt;, but not systems of more than two stars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/14&lt;/em&gt;). Around half of the stars in the galaxy have at least one stellar companion, and their planets often have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-explain-planets-backward-motion&quot;&gt;tilted orbits with respect to their stars&lt;/a&gt;, going around more like a jump rope than a Hula-Hoop (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/1/13&lt;/em&gt;). That misalignment could originate with the disk in which the planets were born: If the disk was askew, the planets would be too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago, astronomers first realized that GW Orionis has three stars and a planet-forming disk, and the scientists scrambled to get a closer look. (At the time, it was impossible to tell if that disk was a single loop or not.) Bi’s team and Kraus’ team aimed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile at the triple-star system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups spotted the trio of stars: one about 2.5 times and another about 1.4 times the sun’s mass orbiting each other once every 242 days, and another 1.4 solar mass star orbiting the inner pair about every 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The observations also revealed three distinct rings of dust and gas encircling the stars. The closest ring to the star trio lies about 46 times the distance from Earth to the sun; the middle one about 185 times the Earth-sun distance; and the outermost ring about 340 times that distance. For perspective, Neptune is about 30 times the distance from Earth to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That innermost ring is strongly misaligned with respect to the other rings and the stars, the teams found. Kraus’ group added observations from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope to show the shadow of the inner ring on the inside of the middle loop. That shadow revealed that the middle ring is warped, swooping up on one side and down on the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;GW Orionis seem from ALMA and SPHERE&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3091088&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090320_lg_misa_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3091088&quot;&gt;Astronomers looked at GW Orionis with the ALMA telescope array (left, blue) and the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope (right, red), both in Chile. The ALMA observations revealed the disk’s tri-ringed structure, while the SPHERE images showed the shadow cast by the innermost ring, allowing scientists to describe the rings’ deformed shapes in detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3091088&quot;&gt;Left image: ALMA/ESO, NAOJ, NRAO; Right image: ESO, S. Kraus et al, Univ. of Exeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, both groups ran computer simulations to figure out how the system formed. This is where their conclusions begin to differ, Bi says. His team suggests that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protoplanetary-gas-disks-stars-gaps-newborn-planets&quot;&gt;newly formed, not-yet-discovered planet cleared its orbit of gas and dust&lt;/a&gt;, splitting the inner ring off from the rest of the disk (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). Once the disk was split, the inner ring was free to swing around the stars, settling into its skewed alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simulations from Kraus’s team, though, found that the chaotic gravity from the triple stars’ orbital dance alone was enough to break up the disk, a phenomenon called disk tearing. Each star tends to keep the disk aligned with itself, and the tug-of-war warped and sheared the disk, and twisted the inner ring even further. Theoretical studies had suggested disk tearing might happen in multiple star systems, but this is the first time it’s been seen in real life, Kraus contends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s plausible that there could be planets somewhere in the system, but they’re not needed to explain the misalignment,” he says. “We don’t need to invoke undiscovered planets to explain what we see.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A trio of stars in GW Orionis are surrounded by an enormous, warped disk of gas and dust, new observations reveal. This animation, which is based on computer simulations and observational data, shows the complex geometry of the deformed and broken-apart disk.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The difference may lie in the assumptions that the groups made about the disk’s properties, in particular its viscosity, says astrophysicist Nienke van der Marel, Bi’s colleague at the University of Victoria. A more viscous disk would tear like how Kraus and colleagues propose, but a less viscous disk needs a planet to break apart, she says. She thinks her team’s work is more realistic based on observations of other star systems. But with current technology, there’s no way to tell what the properties of GW Orionis’ disk are really like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And neither group could explain what made the disk split into three. “We don’t really know what’s causing the outer ring,” Klaus says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lodato, who predicted the disk-tearing effect in 2013, thinks GW Orionis is proof that the phenomenon really exists. Back then, Lodato and colleagues were “very worried” that their simulations showed an effect that was introduced by the computations, not real physics, he says. “Now observations tell us that it does happen in reality.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future telescopes may also be able to spot the planet if it exists, van der Marel says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Black Women With Natural Hair Face Biases From Potential Employers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40194</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/03/black-women-with-natural-hair-face-biases-from-potential-employers/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stories about discriminatory practices against Black people with natural hairstyles (e.g. afros, twists, dreadlocks, braids and cornrows) abound. At school, having natural hair has led to detention, punishment and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/black-pupils-excluded-hair-discrimination-equality-act&quot;&gt;exclusions&lt;/a&gt;, and previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://perception.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TheGood-HairStudyFindingsReport.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found serious stigma around natural hair when it comes to desirability and professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620937937?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;backs this up, finding that such biases can tangibly affect Black women’s chances with potential employers. Christy Zhou Koval at Michigan State University and Ashleigh Shelby Rosette at Duke University found that Black women with natural hairstyles were seen as less competent and less professional than White female applicants or Black applicants with straightened hair — and that they were less likely to get job interviews, too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40194&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 480 participants imagined themselves as a recruiter, tasked with evaluating job applicants based on their Facebook profile. The applicants themselves had a wide range of different hairstyles, but fell into one of four groups: White women with curly or straight hair, and Black women with natural or straightened hair. Participants rated each applicant on professionalism and competence, and indicated how likely they would be to select the applicant for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, Black women with natural hairstyles were rated as less professional and less competent than Black women with straightened hair and White women with both curly and straight hair (though curly-haired White women were ranked as less professional than their straight-haired counterparts). Black women with natural hair were also the group least likely to be recommended for interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study replicated this process — except this time, participants saw multiple pictures of the same women with different hairstyles. The effect held: Black women were seen as less professional, less competent and less likely to be invited to interview when they were depicted with natural hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A further study looked at the role of industry in perception of natural hair. This time, participants were told they were recruiting either for the &lt;em&gt;consulting&lt;/em&gt; industry (traditionally more conservative) or the &lt;em&gt;advertising industry &lt;/em&gt;(more laidback). In the consulting condition, Black women with natural hair were again considered less professional and less competent and again received fewer recommendations for interview than Black women with straightened hair. In advertising, however, there was no difference in either professionalism or interview recommendations. A further study replicated these findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results highlight the need for an intersectional approach to understanding workplace discrimination. It’s obviously true that women often experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/&quot;&gt;extensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/&quot;&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; at work because of their gender — but these biases can be compounded or experienced in completely different ways by women of colour. The discrimination outlined in this study is certainly not the only kind experienced by Black women — and, as the team notes, other women of colour experience stigma around their appearance too. Headscarves, to use just one example, may also affect hiring practices.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at more natural scenarios — although some employers do look at social media profiles while hiring, examining biases during in-person interviews could provide further insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings from the second part of the study suggest that differing norms between sectors may play a key part in perpetuating inequality. It follows that addressing such systemic racism is an important part in addressing these sorts of biases. Public policies, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/army-ban-on-dreadlocks-black-servicewomen.html&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; in some parts of the US, may also help to protect Black women from employment discrimination: in four US states, for example, it’s now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/virginia-hair-discrimination-ban&quot;&gt;illegal to discriminate&lt;/a&gt; based on someone’s hairstyle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that although this study was conducted in an American context, the problem exists across the world — as Irish writer Emma Dabiri points out in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-protect-afro-textured-hair-amend-the-uk-equality-act-to-include-hair&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; to amend the UK Equality Act to include hair discrimination. Research looking at exactly how these biases operate in other countries is key to understanding and tackling such practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620937937?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;The Natural Hair Bias in Job Recruitment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Bering Sea winter ice shrank to its lowest level in 5,500 years in 2018</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3091031</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-bering-sea-ice-winter-melt-lowest-level</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sea ice in the Bering Sea, on the southern margin of the Arctic Ocean, dwindled to its smallest wintertime expanse in 5,500 years in 2018, new data show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Summertime sea ice loss due to climate change has captured headlines, but winter ice in the region has also shown recent signs of decline. In both February 2018 and February 2019, the extent was 60 to 70 percent lower than the average February-to-May extent from 1979 to 2017. However, researchers thought that those declines might be linked to unusual short-term atmospheric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the new study suggests that human-caused climate change is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eaaz9588&quot;&gt;helping to shrink Bering Sea ice during the winter&lt;/a&gt;. The findings, by geologist Miriam Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., and colleagues, were published September 2 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jones and her team collected cores of peat from St. Matthew Island, a remote spot in the Bering Sea west of Alaska. Within the peat — packed remains of partially decomposed plants — oxygen-bearing organic compounds called cellulose contain clues to the climate history of the region.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Rain falling on the island contains two different isotopes, or forms, of oxygen: oxygen-18 and oxygen-16. The relative values of those isotopes in the rainfall change depending on atmospheric conditions, and as plants take up that oxygen from the air, they record those changes. By analyzing the amounts of those isotopes in the cellulose over time, the team was able to track changes in precipitation and atmospheric circulation going back 5,500 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, the team established the link between this oxygen isotope record and sea ice extent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bering Sea ice is known to be directly tied to shifts in wind direction. So the researchers created a computer simulation that included climate conditions from 1979 to 2018, oxygen isotope values from cellulose during that time and satellite observations of sea ice. When winds were strongly blowing from the south, and there was less sea ice, the relative amount of oxygen-18 increased. When winds from the north dominated, and there was more sea ice, there was less oxygen-18 in the cellulose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers used the oxygen isotopes in the peat to track the waxing and waning of the region’s sea ice over thousands of years. Most of the area’s rainfall occurs in winter and spring, so those oxygen isotopes are indicative of conditions between February and May, rather than summer. The peat cellulose oxygen-18 values recorded in winter 2018 were the highest, and the sea ice extent the smallest, in the last 5,500 years, the team found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vanishing ice&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bering Sea ice cover is usually at its greatest extent during the winter and spring, shown on April 29, 2013 (left). But on April 29, 2018 (right), the Bering Sea was virtually ice-free. New research shows that 2018’s winter ice was the lowest in 5,500 years — and that human-caused climate change is linked to this record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Joshua Stevens/NASA Earth Observatory, NSIDC (data)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In preindustrial times, the researchers found, wintertime sea ice was gradually decreasing, largely due to natural changes in incoming sunlight during winter, related to changes in Earth’s orbit. But the team also found that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, compiled from previous studies, were closely correlated to ice volume. As CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;levels began to climb past 280 parts per million following the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, the oxygen-18 values also began to rise, with corresponding sea ice decreases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How exactly increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; might be linked to winter ice volume is less clear. The losses may be directly due to greenhouse gas warming. Or more indirectly, changes to atmospheric circulation patterns due to increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; might also lead to those losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates just how exceptional the recent winter sea ice losses in the region are, says Benjamin Gaglioti, an environmental scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who was not involved in the study. “Although there [was] an overall trend towards less sea ice prior to anthropogenic warming, recent increases in human-derived greenhouse gases have enhanced this trend,” he says. And that is not good news for the region’s denizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Winter sea ice in this region serves as a critical habitat for unique marine wildlife like Pacific walrus and kittiwakes,” Gaglioti says. The ice also helps dampen the impacts of intense winter storms and flooding on coastal communities, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other climate-warming gases has already taken a visible toll on summertime sea ice in and around the Arctic; within 10 to 15 years, the region may be ice-free during the warmer months. Arctic sea ice in September 2019 tied for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future&quot;&gt;second-lowest on record&lt;/a&gt; with 2007 and 2016; first place still goes to 2012 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/25/19&lt;/em&gt;). The loss of that ice is not just a bellwether for climate change in the Arctic, but is also speeding up the rate of warming in the region, a process called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context&quot;&gt;Arctic amplification&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). And the missing summer ice is also triggering a cascade of changes through Arctic ecosystems, including within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bering-sea-ice-disappearing-arctic-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Bering Sea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/14/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the new study suggests that winter sea ice losses might lag behind CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changes by decades, perhaps even a century — and that could mean a year-round ice-free Bering Sea by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Steroids reduce deaths of critically ill COVID-19 patients, WHO confirms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090997</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-steroids-reduce-deaths-covid19-patients-who</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In June, a large study in the United Kingdom suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-dexamethasone-reduce-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths&quot;&gt;the steroid dexamethasone&lt;/a&gt; could help reduce the risk of death for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Now, more evidence suggests that steroids are an effective weapon against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the World Health Organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.17023?guestAccessKey=ec87204d-c42d-4d34-bef5-077a40bc86b0&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090220&quot;&gt;combined data from seven randomized clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with steroids versus standard care or a placebo up to June 9. The trials used the steroids hydrocortisone, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who were on ventilators when their clinical trial started had a 30 percent chance of dying from the virus if given steroids compared with a 38 percent chance on standard care or a placebo, researchers report September 2 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;. Results were even more promising for critically ill people who were not on ventilators: Those taking steroids had a 23 percent chance of death compared with a 42 percent for people taking a placebo or getting standard care. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Results of three of the studies included in the combined analysis — one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770276?guestAccessKey=87249cc0-d27a-4fd1-92de-82c71732a4c2&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090220&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; testing hydrocortisone, a trial of dexamethasone in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770277?guestAccessKey=52805eb1-785a-4bcc-8d1d-9ca94a382711&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090220&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770278?guestAccessKey=23fa39bc-68d3-4d4a-88ef-37c908849a05&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=090220&quot;&gt;international study&lt;/a&gt; of hydrocortisone — were published at the same time in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;. Those and other trials in the WHO analysis were stopped early because it wouldn’t have been ethical to continue and deny some sick patients steroids once the U.K. study found them effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of the combined analysis, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Corticosteroids-2020.1&quot;&gt;WHO recommended&lt;/a&gt; on September 2 that doctors give dexamethasone or hydrocortisone to severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not to people with milder illness. Giving steroids to people with moderate or mild cases might dampen the immune system too much, allowing the virus to do more damage. The U.S. National Institutes of Health have also recommended use of steroids for hospitalized people who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/immune-based-therapy/immunomodulators/corticosteroids/&quot;&gt;need extra oxygen&lt;/a&gt; or are on ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we do to stay connected in the middle of a pandemic? &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve all played our part in fighting COVID-19, and for many of us that has meant staying away from our friends and families. In this episode, our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt; explores how this unprecedented period of separation has reinforced the importance of connection. Ginny looks at how video chats compare to in-person interaction, and how psychology could help improve virtual communication in the future. She also examines the importance of touch for reducing stress — and asks whether interactions with our furry friends could make up for a lack of human contact.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Toy boats float upside down underneath a layer of levitated liquid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090971</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/toy-boats-float-upside-down-under-levitated-liquid-antigravity</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Going bottom-up is no problem for a boat on the underside of a levitated liquid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a container, liquid can be levitated over a layer of gas by shaking the container up and down because the repeated, upward jerking motion keeps fluid from dripping into the air below. Lab experiments have revealed a curious consequence of this antigravity effect. Objects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2643-8&quot;&gt;can float along the bottom of a hovering liquid&lt;/a&gt; as well as along the top, researchers report in the Sept. 3 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicist Emmanuel Fort and colleagues observed this effect by injecting a layer of gas underneath either silicone oil or glycerol and shaking the container. The researchers used these thick substances because keeping a liquid aloft requires vigorous shaking — with larger pools requiring stronger vibrations — and a runny fluid like water would slosh around too much to form a stable, levitated layer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Technically, you could have a liquid pool of any size stay up, just by shaking it enough,” says Fort, of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. “If you’d like to have a swimming pool upside down, it’s possible … but you’d need to have a very viscous fluid.” Here, Fort’s team stuck to levitating up to half a liter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Physicists knew it was possible to keep a layer of liquid levitated over a cushion of air by vigorously shaking the layers up and down in a container. But new lab experiments have revealed a surprising effect of that antigravity trick. Toy boats and other objects are able to float along the bottom surface of a levitated liquid as well as its top.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toy boats bobbed along the bottom of the hovering liquid because, like boats floating right-side up along the top, the toys were partially submerged. Any object submerged in a liquid experiences a skyward, buoyant force, whose strength depends on the amount of space the object takes up in the liquid. That physical law, discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes, is why dense objects sink and less dense ones float. Diving rings sit at the bottom of a pool because they have a lot of mass but don’t take up much space, so the force of gravity beats buoyancy. A beach ball, on the other hand, has very little mass but takes up a lot of space, so if it were placed at the bottom of a pool, it would bob to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A partially submerged, upside-down boat experiences the same upward pull. As a result, if the right amount of the boat is submerged, the force of buoyancy is strong enough to counteract gravity pulling the boat down, and the boat floats. Bet Archimedes didn’t see that coming.    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whatever floats your boat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toy boats at the top and bottom surfaces of a levitated liquid (illustrated) are partially submerged in liquid, and so experience the upward force of buoyancy. That force counteracts the downward pull of gravity, allowing the toys to float on both sides of the liquid’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Buoyancy explains how a top-down boat floats on levitated liquid&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Buoyancy explains how a top-down boat floats on levitated liquid&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090972&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/083120_mt_boatfloat_inline_desktop.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090972&quot;&gt;E. Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Buoyancy explains how a top-down boat floats on levitated liquid&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090973&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/083120_mt_boatfloat_inline_mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090973&quot;&gt;E.

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was very surprised” to see the effect, says Vladislav Sorokin, an engineer at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, who coauthored a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02451-w&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; on the study that appears in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Sorokin has studied another paradoxical phenomenon in vibrating liquids — the fact that bubbles sink to the bottom of the liquid rather than rising to the top. The discovery of this new phenomenon hints that perhaps other counterintuitive effects are yet to be discovered in vibrating systems, he says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Record-breaking gravitational waves reveal that midsize black holes do exist</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090963</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest. The farthest. The most energetic. A new detection of gravitational waves from two colliding black holes has racked up multiple superlatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, it also marks the first definitive sighting of an intermediate mass black hole, one with a mass between 100 and 100,000 times the sun’s mass. That midsize black hole was forged when the two progenitor black holes coalesced to form a larger one with about 142 solar masses. It significantly outweighs all black holes previously detected via gravitational waves, ripples that wrinkle spacetime in the aftermath of extreme events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the big guy we’ve been waiting for, for the longest time,” says Emanuele Berti, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research. One of the behemoth’s two progenitors was itself so massive that scientists are pondering how to explain its existence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detected on May 21, 2019, the gravitational waves originated from a source about 17 billion light-years from Earth, making this &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.ligo.org/P2000020/public&quot;&gt;the most distant detection&lt;/a&gt; confirmed so far. Because of the expansion of the universe, that distance corresponds to a travel time of about 7 billion years, meaning that the gravitational waves were emitted when the universe was about half its current age. It’s also the most energetic event yet seen, radiating about eight times the equivalent of the sun’s mass in energy, says astrophysicist Karan Jani of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. “I hope it deserves its own entry in the record book.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new event &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-detects-gravitational-waves-4-black-hole-collisions&quot;&gt;dethrones the previous record-holder&lt;/a&gt;, a collision that occurred about 9 billion light-years away that radiated about five solar masses worth of energy, and created a black hole of 80 solar masses (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/4/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers with LIGO, or the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in the United States and Advanced Virgo in Italy reported the new detection September 2 in two papers in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While scientists know of black holes with tens of solar masses and others with millions or billions of solar masses, the intermediate echelon has remained elusive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/middleweight-black-hole-suspected-near-milky-ways-center&quot;&gt;Previous purported sightings&lt;/a&gt; of intermediate mass black holes have been questioned (&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/22/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, for the new event, “there’s no doubt,” says astrophysicist Cole Miller of University of Maryland at College Park, who was not involved with the study. “This demonstrates that there is now at least one intermediate mass black hole in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The black hole’s two progenitors were themselves heftier than any seen colliding before — at about 85 and 66 times the mass of the sun. That has scientists &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.ligo.org/P2000021/public&quot;&gt;puzzling over how this smashup came to be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kicking it up a notch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On May 21, 2019, the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories detected two merging black holes. The duo combined to create a new black hole much larger than those found in previous mergers. Here, colored circles represent the relative sizes of black holes, with bluer colors representing bigger black holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Newfound black hole masses compared with previous mergers&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Newfound black hole masses compared with previous mergers&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090966&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090120_ec_ligo_inline_desktop_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090966&quot;&gt;R. Hurt/IPAC/Caltech, MIT, LIGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Newfound black hole masses compared with previous mergers&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090965&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/090120_ec_ligo_inline_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090965&quot;&gt;R. Hurt/IPAC/Caltech, MIT, LIGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, physicists expect that the black holes involved in these mergers would each have formed in the collapse of a dying star. But in the new event, the larger of the pair is so big that it couldn’t have formed that way. The known processes that go on within a star’s core mean that stars that are the right mass to form such a big black hole would blow themselves apart completely, rather than leaving behind a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, it might be that one or both of the colliding black holes formed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spin-may-reveal-black-hole-history&quot;&gt;an earlier round of black hole mergers&lt;/a&gt;, within a crowded cluster of stars and black holes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/30/17&lt;/em&gt;). That would make for a family tree that began with black holes lightweight enough to form from collapsing stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem with the multiple-merger explanation. Each time black holes merge, that coalescence provides a kick to their velocity, which would normally launch the resulting black hole out of the cluster, preventing further mergers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, mergers as massive as the new event seem to be very rare, given that LIGO and Virgo have detected only one. That means, Miller says, “my gosh, you’re allowed to invoke a tooth fairy,” a relatively unlikely process. Perhaps, he says, the kick might sometimes be small enough that the black holes could stay within their cluster and merge again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The May 21 gravitational wave event had previously been publicly reported as an unconfirmed candidate, to allow astronomers to look for flashes of light in the sky that might have resulted from the collision. Some researchers had suggested that the waves might have been associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-black-holes-may-have-created-surprising-flare-light&quot;&gt;a flare of light&lt;/a&gt; from the center of a distant galaxy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/25/20&lt;/em&gt;). But that galaxy is significantly closer than the distance now pinpointed in the new papers, at about 8 billion light-years from Earth rather than 17 billion, making the explanation less plausible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longer LIGO and Virgo observe the heavens, the more the bounty of unusual events can be expected to grow, Miller says. “We are going to have a set of ‘gosh, didn’t expect that’ type of events, which are thrilling to think about and extremely informative about the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Flamboyant cuttlefish save their bright patterns for flirting, fighting and fleeing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090932</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flamboyant-cuttlefish-video-mating-defense-camouflage</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the name fool you. Flamboyant cuttlefish (&lt;em&gt;Metasepia pfefferi&lt;/em&gt;) look anything but flashy most of the time. Images and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jB8YljliM&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; of the marine mollusks flashing bright purple and yellow hues litter the internet, perpetuating the idea that these animals are constantly putting on a show in the wild. But a new study proves just the opposite: Flamboyant cuttlefish spend most of their time looking like a pile of mud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These animals have superb camouflage,” says Roger Hanlon, a marine biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. Specialized cells and structures in their skin allow the animals to instantly morph into ostentatious patterns, as well as blend in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keen to see how the animals balanced flamboyance with camo in nature, Hanlon organized two field studies in a cuttlefish habitat off the coast of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Citizen scientist divers scouted the Lembeh Strait area over eight days in 2002 and again for 11 days in 2019, being careful to eavesdrop without disturbing the animals.  Video footage collected by the team now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098120300642&quot;&gt;reveals intimate details of the species’ mating practices and defensive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; as well as what the animals do in their downtime. Hanlon and Gwendolyn McManus, a marine biology student at Northeastern University in Boston, describe the results in the August &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solitary species slowly ambles along the seafloor, foraging in a drab region of mud and sand between coral reefs. “It’s like a moonscape or a desert,” says Hanlon. Flamboyant cuttlefish take on the color and texture of their muddy seafloor backdrop and masquerade as a lump of sand or a rock. Like some other cephalopods, these cuttlefish spend most of their time incognito, reserving their displays for special occasions: confusing a predator, courting a mate and sparring with rival suitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cuttlefish in colorful form and in camouflage&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090934&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082820_ht_cuttlefish_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090934&quot;&gt;Contrary to previous studies and scuba diver reports, flamboyant cuttlefish don’t parade around the ocean in full getup (left). They actually spend most days pretending to be rocks (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090934&quot;&gt;L-R:  R. Hanlon, F. Bavendam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flashing their good looks 24/7 would attract unwanted attention. But it comes in handy if their first line of defense — camouflage — fails. Then, both males and females will engage in a campaign of unpredictability. When confronted by a threat, the animal might quickly flash its colors to frighten the predator, sometimes in just 700 milliseconds. Next, it cycles through other confusing behaviors — jetting, shooting ink and reverting to camouflage — until it has eluded the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Males also show flamboyant displays to attract the ladies. After spotting a female in the distance, a male will flaunt bright colors and undulate their mantle stripes in a move called “the passing cloud.” Researchers also observed two types of gestures during this colorful routine: arm waving (reminiscent of a human bowing) and kissing (a tap on the female’s arm with his arms). “These displays are really elaborate and dynamic,” says Hanlon. “And they’re comparable to what some of the most sophisticated birds do and even some primates.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Love triangles happen, and males sometimes guard females and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watch-male-cuttlefish-fight-over-female-wild&quot;&gt;fight off other males&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/12/17&lt;/em&gt;). In brawls, male body patterns split flirting and fighting. The side facing the female flashes the bright motif, while the side facing the male takes on an aggressive white pattern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Video footage from field studies in Indonesia provides an inside look at the lives of flamboyant cuttlefish.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of this pizzazz can put males at risk. Hanlon recalls an instance where a male swimming backward got scarfed up by a scorpion fish in the midst of his flamboyant display. “There’s the price you pay for displaying to a female not paying attention to where you’re going,” says Hanlon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the risk can come with reward — for some lucky guys. Eventually, a female may open her arms and mate for a quick three seconds. Figuring out exactly what flirting tactics a female uses to select her mate requires more data. “Does she focus on the male’s courtship dance? On his ‘kiss’ signal? Or on how bright his passing cloud is? It’s too soon to tell,” says Alex Schnell, a wildlife scientist at Cambridge University who was not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Males also got shot down a lot, as picky females appear largely unmoved by most of their showmanship. Of 108 kisses observed, only 20 led to something more. The observations hint that the most successful males might be the ones that worked the hardest and remained persistent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field observations fill in knowledge gaps about how these animals survive in the wild and contradict two previous studies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/efb8/67473e707923b70d7a96e378a78f1d15ff9a.pdf&quot;&gt;a lab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/articles/2035/&quot;&gt;an aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, as well as photos and videos from scuba divers, that suggested that the animals displayed their flamboyant patterns more frequently. Looming humans, bright lights and higher density tanks may have shifted the behavior of a species that spends most of its time alone and under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“This Neuralink is implanted in the region of the brain that uh where where the snout the snout is located which is actually quite a large part of the pig's brain.”&lt;sup&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elon Musk held a press event (product demo) to make grandiose claims about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuralink.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; 1024-channel brain implant currently under development by his start-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three pigs were unveiled, all healthy and happy: Joyce (the one without an implant), Dorothy (who formerly had an implant), and Gertrude, the star of the day with her snout boops. The crowd applauded, impressed at this monumental accomplishment. However, recording spike trains from the brains of animals is as old as time. And actually, &lt;i&gt;wireless&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902772/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Implantable Neuroprosthetics in Pigs is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;so&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of this post in TNW said it best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/08/31/i-was-excited-for-neuralink-then-i-watched-elon-musks-stupid-demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I was excited for Neuralink. Then I watched Elon Musk’s stupid demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Here’s the one fact you need to know: Neuralink's actual device is less capable than similar medical &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/1/2/001/meta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;brain computer interface&quot;&gt;BCI&lt;/a&gt;s already on the market. The big claim to fame here is that Neuralink hopes one day to bring this technology to the masses.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really, invasive intracranial technology is likely to obsolete by the time the requisite advances in neural decoding would occur (if ever). As Kording Lab member &lt;a href=&quot;http://kordinglab.com/people/ari_benjamin/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ari Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53956683&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Once they have the recordings, Neuralink will need to decode them and will someday hit the barrier that is our lack of basic understanding of how the brain works, no matter how many neurons they record from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decoding goals and movement plans is hard when you don't understand the neural code in which those things are communicated.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another winner in the snark department was MIT Technology Review, with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/30/1007786/elon-musks-neuralink-demo-update-neuroscience-theater/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink is neuroscience theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“...Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide. One difficulty ahead of the company is perfecting microwires that can survive the ‘corrosive’ context of a living brain for a decade. That problem alone could take years to solve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary objective of the streamed demo, instead, was to stir excitement, recruit engineers to the company (which already employs about 100 people), and build the kind of fan base that has cheered on Musk’s other ventures...”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cult of Musk is indeed cheering, in a rather credulous fashion (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OHcCpt0Ds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Neuralink Will Change Humanity Forever&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It's actually correct that the representation of the snout in pig somatosensory cortex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961777/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occupies a disproportionately large portion of the cortex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902772/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Borton et al. (2011)&lt;/a&gt; reported on their “complete neural prosthetic developmental system using a wireless  sensor as the implant, a pig as the animal model, and a novel data  acquisition paradigm for actuator control.” At that time, the system had 'only' 16 channels, but the field as a whole has evolved since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM (Sept 1, 2020):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Neuralink Progress Update, Summer 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g6tWxlQQ-RI/X04JNQQyUdI/AAAAAAAANMs/WSYlRS6a0tMMaTWSp1fdZAp-oDg60aJ0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/the%2Blink%2Bdoes%2Bit%2Ball.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;384&quot; data-original-width=&quot;811&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g6tWxlQQ-RI/X04JNQQyUdI/AAAAAAAANMs/WSYlRS6a0tMMaTWSp1fdZAp-oDg60aJ0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/the%2Blink%2Bdoes%2Bit%2Ball.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;An implantable device will solve all these problems by correcting aberrant electrical signals.

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Theme of 2020 Open Access Week to be Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18377</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5xUm1rHSfOw/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This post was written by Nick Shockey and first appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/2020-theme-announcement-english&quot;&gt;openaccessweek.org&lt;/a&gt; and has since been reposted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparcopen.org/&quot;&gt;sparcopen.org.&lt;/a&gt; Nick is the Director of Programs and Engagement for SPARC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year’s International Open Access Week, to be held October 19-25, will be “Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openness can be a powerful tool for building more equitable systems of sharing knowledge. Rebuilding research and scholarship to be open by default presents a unique opportunity to construct a foundation that is fundamentally more equitable. Yet today, structural racism, discrimination, and exclusion are present and persistent in places where openness is a core value. As a global community, it is important to understand that the systems and spaces of the present are often built upon legacies of historic injustice and that addressing these inequities is a necessity.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to examine who these spaces and systems are designed for, who is missing, who is excluded by the business models we use, and whose interests are prioritized. As we work together to rebuild these structures, we need to commit to moving from conversations to concrete commitments and to hold one another accountable for making real progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on our discussions in 2018 (“Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge”) and 2019 (“Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge”), 2020 marks the third consecutive year the theme for International Open Access Week will focus on the urgent need for action on equity and inclusion, underscoring the urgency of continuing to center this work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year’s Open Access Week will be held from October 19th through the 25th; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year’s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true for this year with the varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information about International Open Access Week, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/&quot;&gt;www.openaccessweek.org&lt;/a&gt;. The official twitter hashtag for the week is #OAWeek.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: 50 years ago, scientists were trying to develop a low-emission car</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cover of September 12, 1970 issue&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090939&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_50ya_cover-139x186.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another auto entry&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/another-auto-entry&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, September 12, 1970&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent week-long clean air car race from Massachusetts to California provided a shotgun approach to development of low-emission or nonpolluting vehicle engines. Yet despite more than 40 entries employing five engine classes, the winner was a modified standard internal-combustion engine…. There is a consensus among some engineers that the answer will lie with some form of electrically powered vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most vehicles today house internal-combustion engines, but cars with electric motors are gaining ground. In 2010, there were about 17,000 electric cars globally, including all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids. By 2019, that number had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020#the-global-electric-vehicle-fleet-expanded-significantly-over-the-last-decade-underpinned-by-supportive-policies-and-technology-advances&quot;&gt;soared to 7.2 million&lt;/a&gt;, the International Energy Agency reported in June. Although air pollution and oil shortages sparked interest in electric cars, the vehicles also curb greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, generating energy for electric cars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020#the-global-electric-vehicle-fleet-expanded-significantly-over-the-last-decade-underpinned-by-supportive-policies-and-technology-advances&quot;&gt;emitted about half as much carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; equivalent as that emitted from the same number of gas-fueled vehicles, the agency noted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In October 2019, I discovered that the Scopus profile of the journal Transylvanian Review contained numerous faked articles. How did I know?

	<title>Science News: Stonehenge enhanced sounds like voices or music for people inside the monument</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090861</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stonehenge-acoustics-sounds-voices-music</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Soundhenge. Better known as Stonehenge, this ancient monument in southern England created an acoustic space that amplified voices and improved the sound of any music being played for people standing within the massive circle of stones, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of how stones were placed, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320301394&quot;&gt;speech or music would not have projected beyond Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; into the surrounding countryside, or even to people standing near the stone circle, scientists report in the October &lt;em&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore Stonehenge’s sound dynamics, acoustical engineer Trevor Cox and colleagues used laser scans of the site and archaeological evidence to construct &lt;a href=&quot;https://acousticengineering.wordpress.com/2019/08/27/an-acoustic-scale-model-of-stonehenge/&quot;&gt;a physical model one-twelfth the size of the actual monument&lt;/a&gt;. That was the largest possible scale replica that could fit inside an acoustic chamber at the University of Salford in England, where Cox works. This room simulated the acoustic effects of the open landscape surrounding Stonehenge and compacted ground inside the monument.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stonehenge Lego, as Cox dubbed the model, was assembled assuming that Stonehenge’s outer circle of standing sarsen stones — a type of silcrete rock found in southern England — had originally consisted of 30 stones. Stonehenge today includes 63 complete stones, including 17 standing sarsen stones in the outer circle. Based on an estimated total of 157 stones placed at the site around 4,200 years ago, the researchers 3-D printed 27 stones of all sizes and shapes. Then, the team used silicone molds of those items and plaster mixed with other materials to re-create the remaining 130 stones. Simulated stones were constructed to minimize sound absorption, much like actual stones at Stonehenge, Cox says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Trevor Cox with Stonehenge model&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090863&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_bb_stonehenge_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090863&quot;&gt;Acoustical engineer Trevor Cox works with a scale model of Stonehenge in a sound chamber at England’s University of Salford.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090863&quot;&gt;Acoustics Research Centre/Univ. of Salford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team placed speakers and microphones at various points inside and just outside Stonehenge Lego. Each speaker emitted chirping sounds that swept from low to high frequencies. Sound frequencies were modulated so that the speakers’ sounds interacted with the model stones much as natural sounds behave at actual Stonehenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite many gaps between stones, sounds briefly lingered inside Stonehenge Lego, the team found. &lt;a href=&quot;https://acousticengineering.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/how-reverberant-was-stonehenge/&quot;&gt;Reverberation time, a measure of the time it takes sound to decay by 60 decibels&lt;/a&gt;, averaged about 0.6 seconds inside the model for mid-frequency sounds. That effect would have boosted the ability to hear voices and enhanced sounds of drums or other musical instruments, Cox says. For comparison, reverberation time reaches about 0.4 seconds in a living room, around two seconds in a large concert hall and roughly eight seconds in a large cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Stonehenge Lego did not project sounds into the surrounding area or boost the quality of sounds coming from external speakers. And sounds did not echo in the scale model. Inner groups of simulated stones obscured and scattered sounds reflected off the outer sarsen circle, blocking echo formation.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Previous research has been done on Stonehenge’s acoustics, but was incomplete, says archaeologist Timothy Darvill of Bournemouth University in England who has excavated at Stonehenge but did not participate in the new research. That work includes sound measurements taken at what remains of Stonehenge today and at &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.391.8353&quot;&gt;a Stonehenge replica in Washington state&lt;/a&gt; made of concrete blocks. Another acoustic study employed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2624-599X/1/3/39&quot;&gt;a computer model of the ancient site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the new study was “carefully and rigorously done,” questions remain about sonic effects at Stonehenge, says musicologist Rupert Till of the University of Huddersfield in England, who conducted some of the previous research. A wider range of acoustic measures is needed, for instance, to detect echo effects in the scale model that are also present at Stonehenge, Till argues. Further research also needs to untangle why “Stonehenge hums when the wind blows hard,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not known what, if any, ceremonies or activities occurred at Stonehenge, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cremated-remains-reveal-hints-who-buried-stonehenge&quot;&gt;the site did serve as a cemetery&lt;/a&gt; between around 5,000 and 4,400 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/2/18&lt;/em&gt;). And Cox cautions that designers of Stonehenge were likely less concerned about acoustics than about issues such as treatment of the dead and astronomical alignments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever people once did at Stonehenge, the new study “shows that sound was fairly well contained within the monument and, by implication, [Stonehenge] was fairly well insulated from sounds coming in,” Darvill says. Hearing sounds of some kind circulating inside the ancient monument “must have been one of the fundamental experiences of Stonehenge.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: New coronavirus tests promise to be faster, cheaper and easier</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090907</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%208%20TEST%20JULY%202020.pdf&quot;&gt;average wait time for COVID-19 test results&lt;/a&gt; is about four days. Even worse, 10 percent of individuals don’t receive lab results for 10 days or more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quick reporting of test results helps identify infected individuals so they and anyone they potentially spread the coronavirus to can be isolated, preventing further spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a 14-day lag to knowing if someone is actually sick and contagious, then they’ll interact with many, many more people in that period than if you have a one-day or a six-hour or one-hour turnaround,” says Omar Abudayyeh, a bioengineer at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abudayyeh is among the many researchers and companies racing to develop new and speedier types of diagnostic tests that circumvent clinical labs altogether. Some of these tests complete their analyses in all-in-one machines that are portable enough to be set up in schools, nursing homes and offices. Several companies are developing tests like these that can diagnose COVID-19 in 30 minutes or less, with a level of accuracy comparable to lab tests. Others are harnessing the power of the gene editor CRISPR to deliver rapid results.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And another type of test, made by Abbott Laboratories and granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 26, works more like a pregnancy test. All it requires is a test card the size of a credit card, a few drops of a reaction solution and a sample from a nasal swab. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-where-results-can-be-read-directly-testing-card&quot;&gt;Within 15 minutes, two lines appear&lt;/a&gt; on the card if the sample contains the virus; one line appears if it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;The gold standard&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current gold standard for accurate COVID-19 testing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states&quot;&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt;, or polymerase chain reaction, which can detect even tiny quantities of the virus’s genetic material, RNA (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/6/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test requires collecting viral RNA directly from the patient, typically gathered using a swab inserted deep into the nasal cavity. At a clinical laboratory, the virus’s RNA is converted to DNA and then run through a specialized instrument that heats and cools that DNA to multiply copies of it, making it easier to detect. After repeating the process for around an hour, if DNA shows up, the sample is considered positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such tests are fairly accurate. They miss some people very early in the infection or because of lab errors, producing false negatives, meaning that the test results indicate someone isn’t infected when they really are. False positives — when tests wrongly indicate an uninfected person has the virus — are rare with this type of technology. So if a PCR test indicates a person is infected, they probably do carry the virus. The main drawback is the speed. It typically takes days to get results back, and backups at labs can drag the process out for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people find the nasal probe uncomfortable, so other lab tests have been developed that rely on less invasive samples. On August 15, the FDA authorized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-yale-school-public-health&quot;&gt;a saliva-based test&lt;/a&gt;, SalivaDirect, for emergency use. This isn’t the first test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva, which is easier to collect than samples from nasal passages. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167791v1&quot;&gt;its simplified protocol&lt;/a&gt; speeds up sample preparation and bypasses testing supplies that have been in short supply in recent months. SalivaDirect, however, is not a rapid test. It still requires processing by clinical laboratories, which contributes to the wait time between providing a sample and receiving results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To develop faster tests, companies are taking a variety of approaches. Funding for some of this work comes from the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, or RADx, from the National Institutes of Health, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-delivering-new-covid-19-testing-technologies-meet-us-demand&quot;&gt;invested $248.7 million in seven companies&lt;/a&gt; tackling testing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Small, rectangular medical device with a flip-top&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090911&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/081820_JA_rapid-covid_inline-680_square-432x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090911&quot;&gt;Compact instruments, such as Mesa Biotech’s Accula test, replace the function of clinical labs and could bring rapid testing to schools, nursing homes and offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090911&quot;&gt;Mesa Biotech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;San Diego–based Mesa Biotech, for instance, received RADx funding to manufacture a PCR test that replaces an entire clinical lab with a handheld dock and a single-use cartridge. The company says the proprietary technology in its Accula test, which has already received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/136345/download&quot;&gt;FDA emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;, can provide a COVID-19 diagnosis in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Turning on the LAMP&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other RADx-funded companies, such as Talis Biomedical, headquartered in Menlo Park, Calif., aren’t using PCR to amplify SARS-CoV-2 viral material. The Talis One system instead uses LAMP, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In a typical LAMP assay, a patient’s nasal or oral swab sample is mixed with enzymes and specially designed DNA fragments, then heated to 65° Celsius to copy the viral RNA to DNA and produce many more DNA copies. With the Talis test, samples are placed in a cassette, popped into a specialized dock, and analyzed in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As opposed to an instrument that cycles between hot and cold, LAMP heats the reaction to one temperature. “You could run the reaction in a water bath,” says Nathan Tanner, a molecular biologist at New England Biolabs in Ipswich, Mass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, LAMP-based diagnostic tests aren’t quite as sensitive as ones based on PCR, Tanner says, but could be used to test more people, given their simpler requirements. In one &lt;a href=&quot;https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/12/556/eabc7075&quot;&gt;newly described LAMP testing method&lt;/a&gt;, a solution changes color in the presence of 100 or more SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules. The authors, who describe the test August 12 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, propose that the approach, which didn’t detect the lowest viral loads, would be suitable for identifying individuals with a moderate to high viral load.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Telltale proteins&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third RADx-funded test provides results in a mere 15 minutes. Rather than detecting viral RNA, the test, by Quidel, based in San Diego, detects proteins from virus particles. These viral proteins are also antigens, meaning they stimulate immune responses when they invade our bodies. Such antigen tests are similar to ones used in doctors’ offices and pharmacies to diagnose people with influenza.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse antigen tests with an antibody test that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us&quot;&gt;detects antibodies a person develops in response to an infection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/28/20&lt;/em&gt;) Much like a pregnancy test, COVID-19 antigen tests use antibodies to detect the viral proteins and give a yes or no answer, says Kim Hamad-Schifferli, a bioengineer at the University of Massachusetts Boston.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Quidel Sofia SARS antigen test has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/137886/download&quot;&gt;authorized for emergency use&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other RADx-funded rapid tests, it uses a dock and single-use cartridges: Instead of making a line on stick the way a pregnancy test does, the dock detects a fluorescent signal if SARS-CoV-2 proteins are present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;box showing text kit, with examples of the test cards, a swab and a bottle of solution&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090909&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082820_ja_rapidtest_inline_testkit-675x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090909&quot;&gt;An antigen test by Abbott Laboratories requires only a test card, a swab sample and a few drops of a reaction solution to return a COVID-19 diagnosis in 15 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090909&quot;&gt;Abbott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories’ test granted emergency use authorization August 26 also is an antigen test and, with its card-based technology, is even simpler. Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., said its test was able to detect 34 of 35 COVID-19-positive patients with symptoms, or 97 percent, in initial studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefit: An antigen test doesn’t require any specialized lab instruments or enzymes. “It’s all self-contained,” Hamad-Schifferli says. Without a step to amplify viral material, however, an antigen test can be less sensitive than PCR or LAMP and result in a higher rate of false-negative results, up to 20 percent per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas&quot;&gt;FDA’s emergency use authorization guidelines for antigen tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because people may produce widely varying amounts of virus, depending on how long has passed since they became infected. In most people, the coronavirus is most abundant from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms&quot;&gt;couple of days after infection to about nine days&lt;/a&gt; into the illness (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). After that, the immune system kicks in, preventing viruses from being made. On the other hand, viral RNA can be detectable in some people for more than a month.  A negative result from an antigen test has a higher chance of being false comfort, so the FDA says that diagnosis may need to be confirmed with another type of test, like PCR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A new kind of rapid test&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though antigen tests typically are not as accurate as standard PCR or the new rapid tests, they could play a crucial role helping to end the pandemic — if their use becomes widespread. As of now, though, even Abbott’s 15-minute test still needs to be ordered by a doctor and performed in a health care setting, so that can provide hurdles to its use. But what if people didn’t even have to leave home to get a test?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what Hamad-Schifferli and her colleagues are working on. The idea is to build a cheaper test that doesn’t involve a dedicated instrument — just a paper strip and a signal detectable by eye. Such a simple test could be used more widely by people at home. “It would be a game changer,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If COVID-19 tests are deployed widely enough, they could serve as a public health measure to identify people with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 and spreading the virus to others, even if they’re not displaying symptoms. That’s because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-united-states-wasted-time-lockdowns-reopening&quot;&gt;frequent and fast tests can be used to pinpoint outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; as they are happening (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/1/20&lt;/em&gt;).  If cheap enough, these tests could be used by people daily, catching any missed detections through repeated rounds of testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;The United States is currently &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://covidtracking.com/data/national&quot;&gt;testing nearly 700,000 people a day on average&lt;/a&gt;, based on data from August 21 through August 27. Michael Mina, however, wants to see even more tests, like “200 million tests … every day in this country.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2&quot;&gt;Surveillance provided by such widespread testing&lt;/a&gt; “will effectively do the same thing as a vaccine” in slowing the spread of the coronavirus says Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for daily, population-wide testing that could alert people when they first start transmitting the coronavirus to be adopted, a test needs to be cheap enough — for instance, under a dollar — for many people to use them frequently. Abbott said its tests would cost $5. Quidel’s test cartridges cost $23 apiece and the other RADx-funded rapid tests are likely in a similar price range. Given their higher accuracy, those tests could serve a separate purpose: to conclusively determine if an individual is infected and ensure they receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090908&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082820_ja_rapidtest_inline_driveup.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090908&quot;&gt;With overwhelming demand for COVID-19 testing, it can take days or even longer than a week for people to receive test results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090908&quot;&gt;Hoptocopter/E+/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of tests may be one that is fast, easy, accurate and inexpensive and that could be used broadly — even by people at home. One group of scientists may be among those nearing that goal. The work is led by Abudayyeh, Jonathan Gootenberg and Feng Zhang, all bioengineers at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. Zhang is also at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team developed a test that uses the gene-editing tool CRISPR. All someone has to do is add a sample — either from a nasal swab or saliva — to a tube with a reaction solution, heat the tube to 60° C for an hour in a pot of water, then add a paper test strip to the tube. If two lines appear, that means SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The readout relies on activity of a CRISPR enzyme, Cas12b. If SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in the reaction, Cas12b cuts what’s called a reporter, a short piece of DNA that’s labeled on both ends. The two halves of the reporter then wick up the paper strip to different places and appear as two lines. If viral RNA isn’t present, the reporter remains intact and wicks up the strip to one place, showing up as one line.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new test, STOPCovid, is not yet authorized for clinical use, but based on tests in a small number of patients, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091231v1&quot;&gt;identifies SARS-CoV-2 cases as well as PCR tests&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers reported May 8 in a preprint posted at medRxiv.org. It returns results in about an hour and would cost under $10, they say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike rapid tests relying on docks and cartridges, the STOPCovid test is  designed to scale up to millions of tests per week, says Gootenberg. “There’s never been a demand for millions or tens of millions of tests per week — ever.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other research groups have also developed similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-where-things-stand-tests-testing-united-states&quot;&gt;CRISPR-based COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/17/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the development of so many new technologies to test for the coronavirus, “we’re going to come away from the epidemic with a whole new field of diagnostics,” Mina says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How four summer camps in Maine prevented COVID-19 outbreaks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090899</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-summer-camps-covid19-outbreaks</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the coronavirus hit communities across the United States over the summer, four overnight camps in Maine successfully kept the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of 1,022 people who attended the summer camps, which included campers and staff members, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6935e1.htm?s_cid=mm6935e1_w&quot;&gt;only three people&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for COVID-19, researchers report August 26 in the &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. That’s because the people who came to Maine from 41 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Bermuda and five other countries diligently followed public health measures put in place to stop transmission, the team says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The camps’ success, as well as others including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6934e2.htm?s_cid=mm6934e2_w&quot;&gt;child care programs in Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; that limited coronavirus transmission, could point to a path forward for places like schools that are reopening with in-person classes in the face of the ongoing pandemic, though challenges remain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the camps, a combination of testing, social bubbles, social distancing, masks, quarantine and isolation prevented outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Before arriving at camp, officials told all 642 children and 380 staff members to quarantine with their households for 10 to 14 days. Attendees were also tested for COVID-19 five to seven days prior to arrival — with the exception of 12 people who had already been previously diagnosed. Four people tested positive for the virus and isolated for 10 days at home before heading off to one of the camps, which were in session at different times from mid-June to mid-August. (Three of the four camps ran for less than 50 days and the other went on for 62 days.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once on site, the campers and staff participated in daily symptom checks and activities held largely outdoors. They also hung out in small “bubbles,” or cohorts, that ranged from five to 44 people in size and became like family during the weeks at camp, the researchers say. If people interacted with anyone outside their group, masks and social distancing were required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to give the kids the ability to have a family unit at camp that they didn’t need to be masked or social distanced from,” says Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician at Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough who worked on the new report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attendees came to Maine via car, bus and plane, and could have been exposed to the virus after their initial test, so officials retested the 1,006 attendees who had never had COVID-19 four to nine days after their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that round of testing, two staff members and one camper from three different camps tested positive but never developed symptoms. Their cohorts were quarantined for two weeks, but still “were able to have a camp experience … and continue to have fun and play together,” Blaisdell says. The three positive cases didn’t transmit the virus to anyone else before they were identified. They each remained isolated until they had two negative test results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Off to camp&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 people from 41 U.S. states, as well as Puerto Rico, Bermuda and several other countries, attended summer camps in Maine from mid-June to mid-August. The map shown here indicates which states campers and staff members came from. (No one attended from states colored white.) A fair number of people traveled from states like Texas and Florida that were hit hard over the summer (seven-day daily average rate of coronavirus infection as calculated on July 1, shown), but the camps’ public health measures prevented outbreaks. States with less than 10 cases per 100,000 population are not designated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;Camp population, by home state, and states’ COVID-19 infection rates&lt;/h5&gt;

Blaisdell &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/MMWR 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A map showing camp population, by home state, and states’ COVID-19 infection rates&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090902&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082820_eg_covidcamp_inline1_mobile-450x450.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090902&quot;&gt;L.L. Blaisdell &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/MMWR 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people traveled to Maine from areas where COVID-19 cases were surging over the summer, including Texas, Arizona and Florida. But rigorous testing quickly identified potential spreaders, and small cohorts allowed officials to quickly identify those most at risk of catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that way, “cohorting is an unsung hero of public health intervention,” Blaisdell says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While interventions like cohorts, social distancing and wearing masks can help reduce coronavirus transmission on their own to some extent, each method has limitations. Combining such strategies into a layered approach where people follow multiple guidelines to curb the virus’ spread, like the Maine camps did, can further protect the members of a community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every public health layer is like a layer of Swiss cheese with a hole in it,” Blaisdell says. It’s the stacking of “multiple layers of cheese on top of each other that close those holes and makes for a robust [infectious] disease plan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a summer camp in Georgia faced an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-outbreak-georgia-summer-camp&quot;&gt;outbreak of the virus&lt;/a&gt; even after requiring attendees to provide proof of a negative test before arrival. But there, campers were not required to wear masks, weren’t tested after they arrived at camp and participated in both indoor and outdoor activities (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/31/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the isolated nature of the summer camps in Maine likely made creating a relatively COVID-19–free bubble much easier than it might be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks&quot;&gt;K–12 schools&lt;/a&gt; or universities around the country, where people come and go and may not live on site (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). There were some staff members at the four camps in Maine who went home every day, but those people were required to wear masks at all times and social distance from other attendees. It also likely helped that the amount of coronavirus circulating in Maine was quite low while the camps were running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the larger the school, the harder it will probably be to make sure that public health interventions are being adhered to. “If you follow the rules, then this can absolutely be successful,” says Brian Nichols, a virologist at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. But, “when you scale it up and start looking at public schools and universities, you just have to plan on the fact that some people aren’t going to follow the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the success in Maine hints that containing the virus is possible with a targeted, layered approach, Blaisdell says. “As schools and colleges begin to consider opening, they need to look at their community as a bubble,” she says. “We all need to be making contracts with each other about the behaviors that we’re going to do.” &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists interested in dreams spend a lot of time analysing dream diaries — but what if they could have a computer do all that laborious work for them? &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the promise of a new algorithm that uses text analysis to look for patterns in people’s dream reports, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/new-algorithm-can-find-hidden-patterns-your-dreams&quot;&gt;writes Charlotte Hartley&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The tool could help researchers understand how dreams differ in different populations, or how the content of dreams relates to wellbeing.&lt;span id=&quot;more-40144&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme worry and anxiety is rarely a good thing, but some level of worry can be adaptive&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200824-why-worrying-isnt-as-bad-as-you-think&quot;&gt;Christine Ro takes a look at the benefits of worrying&lt;/a&gt; — and how to worry better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people who live with eating disorders have experienced an exacerbation of their symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-era-isolation-is-making-dangerous-eating-disorders-worse/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;reports Michelle Konstantinovsky&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. There could be many reasons for this, including reduced social support and face-to-face therapy, a lack of structure, and increased feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another study has found that there has been a &lt;em&gt;reduction&lt;/em&gt; in anxiety among year nine students in southwest England during lockdown. &lt;/strong&gt;While stuck at home, kids may have been protected from aspects of school which negatively affect their wellbeing, such as pressures associated with schoolwork and the need to navigate social relationships, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/school-closures-had-positive-effects-on-some-teenagers-mental-health-our-new-research-suggests-144884&quot;&gt;writes researcher Emily Widnall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, the team found that those who felt most disconnected from school had the greatest improvement in wellbeing during lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re facing a very serious situation right now — but could silliness help us through it?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/23/why-it-is-sensible-to-be-silly-serious-times-call-for-drawing-smiley-faces-on-fruit&quot;&gt;Elle Hunt explores the psychological benefits of whimsy and playfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, acronyms are becoming increasingly common in scientific papers, creating barriers for science communication, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/science/science-journals-acronyms-communication/&quot;&gt;reports Hannah Seo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers analysed 25 million papers published in the past 70 years, finding that abstracts and titles contained more than 1 million unique acronyms, most of which were only used a handful of times. More recent papers also contained a greater proportion of acronyms. There is clearly a place for acronyms, Seo writes, but overuse can make science less accessible to the public and even to scientists from different fields.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Puberty can repair the brain’s stress responses after hardship early in life</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090627</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/puberty-teens-brain-stress-responses-early-trauma</link>
	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;A researcher slips stickers under some colored cups on a lazy Susan, then gives the tray a whirl. When the spinning stops, a preschooler must find the hidden stickers. Most children remember where the stickers are, but a few have to check every single cup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game tests working memory, which is among the set of mental skills known as executive function that can be impaired in children who faced trauma early in life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adversity wreaks havoc, and from there, “you have a system that responds differently,” says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychobiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who has spent two decades studying the impact of early-life adversity in adopted children. The focus of this work is extreme adversity, such as being orphaned, rather than everyday challenges, which might teach beneficial resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A childhood characterized by hardship, negligence or abuse can also alter the neuroendocrine system that regulates how the body responds to stress. Problems in the stress response can set kids on a path toward behavior struggles along with increased risk for depression, diabetes and a host of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But recent studies offer hints that such a difficult future may not be inevitable. As Gunnar and others have shown, impaired stress responses can return to normal during puberty, raising the possibility that imbalances created by early trauma can be erased. The research is prompting a new view of puberty as an opportunity — a chance for people who had a shaky start to reset their physiological responses to stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A sense of safety&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the brain perceives a threat — even a temporary one such as a stressful exam or a high-stakes competition — levels of the hormone adrenaline shoot up, setting off the “fight-or-flight” reaction. Breathing and heart rate soar. Palms get sweaty. Sight and other senses sharpen. Before long, the brain sends chemical messengers to stimulate adrenal glands near the kidneys to release cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a photo of a child doing a spin-the-pots task&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090649&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_EL_teen-brain_inline-1-502x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090649&quot;&gt;A spin-the-pots task, with colored cups and hidden stickers, tests working memory, which can be impaired in children who experience early hardship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090649&quot;&gt;N.H. Brito &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cortisol sends sugars into the blood for quick energy. The hormone also slows digestion, immune responses, growth and other processes considered nonessential in a fight-or-flight situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the threat passes, the fight-or-flight response ends, at least in a person whose stress response is working as it should. Adrenaline and cortisol levels fall, heart rate slows and other systems resume business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Gunnar started her doctoral work in the 1970s, researchers had already mapped out the key actors in the stress response. The neuro-endocrine signals involved form the HPA axis, short for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal. When rodents and monkeys face early-life adversity, the HPA axis gets thrown off-kilter. As methods became available for measuring cortisol from samples of saliva — rather than having to collect blood or urine — Gunnar set out to study how the HPA axis influences the brain and behavior in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From experiments with newborn babies in the mid-1980s, Gunnar showed that having a secure parent relationship is important for a healthy neuroendocrine system and helps babies deal with stressful situations, such as getting immunizations. “You can go to the doctor as a baby and get a big shot in one leg and the other leg, and you’re crying your head off … but [the HPA axis] doesn’t kick off,” Gunnar says. However, shots or no shots, if babies get separated from their parents for even a few minutes, “their HPA axis shoots up like a rocket.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gunnar wondered what happens if that sense of safety is disrupted longer-term. She tried studying maltreated and impoverished children, but separating the effects of early hardship from later difficulties is not easy. “The way you start out in life tends to continue,” Gunnar says. A report published last November by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points to the long-term consequences: Compared with their peers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6844e1.htm?s_cid=mm6844e1_w&quot;&gt;adults who experienced childhood trauma are more likely to smoke&lt;/a&gt;, drink heavily, have dropped out of high school and develop heart disease and a host of other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A trip in the mid-1990s set Gunnar on a new path to answer that tricky research question. She ventured with a research team to an orphanage in eastern Romania, where young children were raised in overcrowded, inhumane conditions. “You walk into these wards, and all of a sudden you’re mobbed by kids saying ‘Mama, mama, mama’ … reaching their arms up to get held,” says Gunnar, who had two school-age sons at the time. “It was awful. I just wanted to bring them all home.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What she did bring back to Minnesota, along with that searing memory, was a set of small vials, each containing a saliva sample from a 2- or 3-year-old orphan. To her surprise, the children’s cortisol levels — the end product of the neuroendocrine cascade — were lower than the average toddler’s. That finding offered a window into the effects of long-term parental deprivation on stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Adoptee struggles&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To single out the effects of early hardship, Gunnar needed children who had started life in deprivation but then moved into healthy, supportive environments after infancy. Such children would be the ideal human analog for &lt;a href=&quot;https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/6716163&quot;&gt;all of the animal studies on early adversity&lt;/a&gt;, she thought. It dawned on her that this group exists: adopted orphans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gunnar shared her idea with members of the adoption unit at the Minnesota Department of Human Services. With the department’s support and funding, she surveyed Minnesota parents who had adopted children internationally in the 1990s, and invited families to join a university &lt;a href=&quot;https://innovation.umn.edu/international-adoption-project/&quot;&gt;registry&lt;/a&gt; and participate in research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many parents in the study had noticed early on that their adopted children had behavioral problems. And when the youngsters came to the university lab for problem-solving and sorting tests, including the lazy Susan task and the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kids-waiting-longer-classic-marshmallow-self-control-test&quot;&gt;marshmallow test&lt;/a&gt; of delayed gratification (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/4/18, p. 14&lt;/em&gt;), the children struggled with attention and self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the Romanian orphans, these kids had lower cortisol levels than nonadopted children who had no behavioral problems. In the face of sustained hardship, which has the potential to encourage dangerously high levels of cortisol, a weak stress response — that is, producing less cortisol — could be “nature’s way of preserving the brain and body,” Gunnar speculates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teen-time shift&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before puberty, adopted children, who grew up with early-life trauma (gray curve), had blunted stress responses relative to kids living with biological parents (blue curve). By the time puberty ended, the adopted children showed normal cortisol patterns before, during and after a stressful task. Saliva was collected 20 minutes and 5 minutes before the task, then 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after the task. The researchers converted the data to a logarithmic scale, which shows negative numbers. The actual cortisol levels are between 0 and 1 micrograms per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying the adoptees over time, she found that preschoolers with low cortisol often entered kindergarten with attention problems. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788556/&quot;&gt;blunted&lt;/a&gt; stress response persisted into middle childhood, even after an average of seven to eight years in a household with healthy caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was disheartening, says Russell Romeo, a psychobiologist at Barnard College in New York City. “We’d always thought that maybe if these individuals get out of the adverse situations, they could start recalibrating their stress reactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But research Romeo had done in the mid-2000s gave Gunnar reason to think she just needed to look further down the road of the children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;High time for change&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Romeo was studying rats to see if stress affects adolescent and adult brains differently. In one set of experiments, he subjected adult rats and prepubescent rats to acute stress — 30 minutes trapped inside a wire mesh container — and recorded their levels of corticosterone (the rat version of cortisol) before, during and after the confinement. Both groups produced similar hormone spikes when stressed, but in the juvenile rats, levels took much longer to return to normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Romeo observed how the animals reacted to extended periods of stress — 30 minutes of restraint each day for seven days — the pattern was different. After the animals were released from the restraints, stress hormones surged higher in young rats than in adults. But the rats that were near puberty returned to baseline more quickly than the older animals. Taken together, Romeo’s studies suggested that neuroendocrine stress responses get shaped during puberty to emerge differently in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In earlier work, researchers at McGill University in Montreal showed that moving adolescent rats into “enriched” environments — larger cages with more toys and cagemates — could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/18/7840.long&quot;&gt;reset stress responses&lt;/a&gt; that had been thrown out of whack by early-life trauma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings heartened Gunnar. “Maybe I should be looking at puberty,” she thought. It could be a time to recalibrate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closer to normal&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a stressful activity (giving a speech, for example), saliva cortisol levels rose temporarily and returned to normal in those children who lived with their biological parents. Children who were adopted after starting life in an orphanage (an early-life trauma), had blunted cortisol responses during stages 1 to 2 of puberty. But at the tail end of puberty, stages 4 and 5, adopted children’s stress responses normalized.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-right has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;Source: M.R. Gunnar &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So her team invited 280 7- to 14-year-olds — 122 children adopted from institutions and 158 from socioeconomically comparable biological families — into the lab to complete two stressful tasks. One involved challenging mental math. For the second task, each child prepared a five-minute speech introducing themselves to a new class of students. The children were told that their speech, given in front of a video camera and a mirror, would be rated by judges. Some kids spoke with confidence, while others looked nervous. “We did have one who burst into tears,” Gunnar says. But “we don’t torture them. If we think they’re too nervous, we help them quit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before and after the speech and math tasks, researchers collected saliva samples from each child to measure cortisol levels. Participants’ pubertal status was assessed on a 1-to-5 scale: Stage 1 meant no noticeable body changes and stage 5 meant sexual maturation was complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among kids in early puberty (stages 1–2), adopted kids had blunted cortisol levels before and after the tasks compared with children who lived with their biological parents. This result confirmed Gunnar’s previous research on preschool-aged international adoptees. In the late puberty group (stages 4–5), cortisol patterns looked similar for adopted and nonadopted kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm HPA recalibration had occurred within the same child, rather than just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458083/&quot;&gt;comparing across age groups&lt;/a&gt;, Gunnar and colleagues brought participants in for the same tests one and two years later, for a total of three annual sessions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results, reported in the Nov. 26 &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, show the body can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/116/48/23984.abstract&quot;&gt;recalibrate its response to stressors during puberty&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, something happens in puberty — but not earlier in childhood — that allows the brain to shift back to normal stress responses that had been skewed by early trauma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthew Duggan, a therapist in Long Beach, Calif., who specializes in childhood and adolescence, is encouraged by the findings and thinks they could apply to a wide range of children who have trouble managing their emotions and connecting with others because caretakers abused or ignored them early in life. There may be “a window … where things might be able to change,” Duggan says. “And we have some data here to suggest that at a biological level, that is a possibility. For me, that’s really hopeful to see.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Duggan says Gunnar’s study would have been even more useful if it had assessed participants’ behavior change — for example, by interviewing parents, teachers or the adolescents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How might puberty combine with better caregiving and support to reshape neuroendocrine stress responses? Romeo speculates that it stems from the fact that the hypothalamus and other brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, that control our reactions to stress are among the regions that rewire and strengthen connections during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether those changes in the stress response will ultimately harm or help a young person is hard to predict, Gunnar says. Mental health and resilience emerge from an ever-changing combination of genes and life experiences — some of which set the body awry early on. But adolescence could potentially erase some of the damage, her research shows. Gunnar and others hope to reveal more of the underlying biology behind the reboot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is there a sweet spot for early adversity?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hardships early in life can mean a difficult road ahead. But some small amount of stress may help kids build mental toughness to handle the stresses of everyday life, such as big exams or performances (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/8/19, p. 12&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We learn to handle stress by handling stress,” says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychobiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Early-life stress affects later resilience&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a graph showing how monkeys responded to stress in various sitiatuons&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090653&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_EL_teen-brain_inline-3-mobile.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090653&quot;&gt;T. Tibbitts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Groups of lab monkeys exposed to mild or moderate stress (yellow and red dots) showed lower anxiety later than animals exposed to no stress (blue) or heavy stress (black and white).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-right has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;Source: K.J. Parker &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a stressful experience shows “the world is tough but we can deal with it, perhaps with the help of family and friends,” she says, “we are tougher the next time.” On the other hand, feeling crushed by an intense stressor, such as abuse or a parent’s death, can impart a sense of helplessness that leaves young people “fearful of it happening again,” Gunnar says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2010 study, researchers surveyed 2,398 U.S. adults to understand how pain and stress affect resilience. Participants answered questions about their mental health and overall well-being, and indicated whether they had experienced cumulative lifetime adversities, including a serious illness or divorce in the family. The upshot: People who faced some adversity reported less distress and more life satisfaction compared with those who either experienced heavy adversity or sailed through childhood with ease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experiments in monkeys &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52810-5&quot;&gt;suggest that this is more than a correlation&lt;/a&gt;. A team led by David Lyons, a behavioral neuroscientist at Stanford University, reported causal evidence last November in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Since it can be unethical to randomly assign humans to stressful conditions, the team tested the effects of varying “doses” of stress in squirrel monkeys that had not yet reached puberty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The monkeys in the control group enjoyed a typical lab life — housed in a cage with mom and siblings, plus plenty of water, food and toys. A second group faced a mild stressor — one hour of separation from siblings once daily for 10 days. The stress dose went up a notch for the third group, which had daily separation from siblings and no access to mom during that hour. Two additional groups experienced daily separation from mother and siblings, plus an injection as an additional stressor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ten weeks later, each monkey was moved with its mother to an unfamiliar cage. The researchers assessed the monkeys’ willingness to let go of mom and explore the new digs. The team also analyzed blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol before and after the time spent in the new cage. On the whole, monkeys in the groups that faced one or two stressors clung less to their mothers and more readily explored their new surroundings — showing less anxiety — than both the no-stress and the two high-stress groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cortisol patterns also reflected this trend: Cortisol levels were closer to normal in monkeys exposed to mild or moderate stress than in monkeys from the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Growing up healthy means “learning how to deal with mild challenge and change,” Lyons says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Science News: What’s behind August 2020’s extreme weather? Climate change and bad luck</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090859</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;August 2020 has been a devastating month across large swaths of the United States: As powerful Hurricane Laura barreled into the U.S. Gulf Coast on August 27, fires continued to blaze in California. Meanwhile, farmers are still assessing widespread damage to crops in the Midwest following an Aug. 10 “derecho,” a sudden, hurricane-force windstorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these extreme weather events was the result of a particular set of atmospheric — and in the case of Laura, oceanic — conditions. In part, it’s just bad luck that the United States is being slammed with these events back-to-back-to-back. But for some of these events, such as intense hurricanes and more frequent wildfires, scientists have long warned that climate change has been setting the stage for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; takes a closer look at what causes these kinds of extreme weather events, and the extent to which human-caused climate change may be playing a role in each of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Satellite animation of Hurricane Laura&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090858&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_feat_alt.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090858&quot;&gt;On August 25, NASA’s GOES-West satellite watched as hazy gray smoke emanating from hundreds of wildfires in California drifted eastward, while Hurricane Laura barreled toward Louisiana and Texas. Farther south and east are the wispy remnants of Tropical Storm Marco. Laura made landfall on August 27 as a Category 4 hurricane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090858&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;California wildfires&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A “dry lightning” storm, which produced nearly 11,000 bursts of lightning between August 15 and August 19, set off devastating wildfires in across California. To date, these fires have burned more than 520,000 hectares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is “an unbelievable number to say out loud, even in the last few years,” says climate scientist Daniel Swain, of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lightning in Santa Cruz, California&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090874&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline7_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090874&quot;&gt;Lightning crackles over Mitchell’s Cove in Santa Cruz, Calif., on August 16, part of a rare and severe storm system that triggered wildfires across the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090874&quot;&gt;Shmuel Thaler/The Santa Cruz Sentinel via AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The storm itself was the result of a particular, unusual set of circumstances. But the region was already primed for fires, the stage set by a prolonged and record-breaking heat wave in the western United States — including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-valley-hottest-recorded-temperature-earth&quot;&gt;one of the hottest temperatures ever measured on Earth, at Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Calif. — as well as extreme dryness in the region (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/17/20&lt;/em&gt;). And those conditions bear the fingerprints of climate change, Swain says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The extreme dryness is particularly key, he adds. “It’s not just incremental; it absolutely matters &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; dry it is. You don’t just flip a switch from dry enough to burn to not dry enough to burn. There’s a wide gradient up to dry enough to burn explosively.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both California’s average heat and dryness have become more severe due to climate change, dramatically increasing the likelihood of extreme wildfires. In an Aug. 20 study in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;, Swain and colleagues noted that over the last 40 years, average autumn temperatures increased across the state by about 1 degree Celsius, and statewide precipitation dropped by about 30 percent. That, in turn, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab83a7/pdf&quot;&gt;more than doubled the number of autumn days&lt;/a&gt; with extreme fire weather conditions since the early 1980s, they found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;LNU Lightning Complex wildfire&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090873&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline6_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090873&quot;&gt;An unusual dry lightning storm combined with very dry vegetation and a record-breaking heat wave to spark hundreds of wildfires across California between August 15 and August 19. One group of these fires, collectively referred to as the LNU Lightning Complex, blazed through Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Yolo and Lake counties. Firefighters continued to battle the LNU complex fires on August 23, including in unincorporated Lake County, Calif. (shown).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090873&quot;&gt;AP Photo/Noah Berger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although fall fires in California tend to be more wind-driven, and summertime fires more heat-driven, studies show that the fingerprint of climate change is present in both, Swain says. “A lot of it is very consistent with the long-term picture that scientists were suggesting would evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the stage had been set by the climate, the particular trigger for the latest fires was a “dry lightning” storm that resulted from a strange confluence of two key conditions, each in itself rare for the region and time of year. “’Freak storm’ would not be too far off,” Swain says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;California wildfire smoke&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090875&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline8_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090875&quot;&gt;Smoke still engulfed California on August 24, as more than 650 wildfires continued to blaze across the state (red dots indicate likely fire areas). The two largest fires, both in Northern California, were named for the lightning storm that sparked them: the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex. They are now second and third on the list of California’s largest wildfires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090875&quot;&gt;NASA Worldview, Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first was a plume of moisture from Tropical Storm Fausto, far to the south, which managed to travel north to California on the wind and provide just enough moisture to form clouds. The second was a small atmospheric ripple, the remnants of an old thunderstorm complex in the Sonoran Desert. That ripple, Swain says, was just enough to kick-start mixing in the atmosphere; such vertical motion is the key to thunderstorms. The resulting clouds were stormy but very high, their bases at least 3,000 meters aboveground. They produced plenty of lightning, but most rain would have evaporated during the long dry journey down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Possible links between climate change and the conditions that led to such a dry lightning storm would be “very hard to disentangle,” Swain says. “The conditions are rare to begin with, and not well modeled from a weather perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But, he adds, “we know there’s a climate signal in the background conditions that allowed that rare event to have the outcome it did.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Midwest derecho&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On August 10, a powerful windstorm with the ferocity of a hurricane traveled over 1,200 kilometers in just 14 hours, leaving a path of destruction from eastern South Dakota to western Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The storm was what’s known as a derecho, roughly translating to “straight ahead.” These storms have winds rivaling the strength of a hurricane or tornado, but push forward in one direction instead of rotating. By definition, a derecho produces sustained winds of at least 93 kilometers per hour (similar to the fury of tropical storm-force winds), nearly continuously, for at least 400 kilometers. Their power is equally devastating: The August derecho flattened millions of hectares of crops, uprooted trees, damaged homes, flipped trucks and left hundreds of thousands of people without power.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Iowa derecho storm damage&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090870&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline4_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090870&quot;&gt;A powerful derecho on August 10 twisted these corn and soybean grain bins in Luther, Iowa. The storm-force winds swept 1,200 kilometers across the U.S. Midwest, from South Dakota to Ohio, damaging homes and croplands and leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090870&quot;&gt;Daniel Acker/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Midwest has had many derechos before, says Alan Czarnetzki, a meteorologist at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. What made this one significant and unusual was its intensity and scale — and, Czarnetzki notes, the fact that it took even researchers by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Derechos originate within a mesoscale convective system — a vast, organized system of thunderclouds that are the basic building block for many different kinds of storms, including hurricanes and tornadoes. Unlike the better-known rotating supercells, however, derechos form from long bands of swiftly moving thunderstorms, sometimes called squall lines. In hindsight, derechos are easy to recognize. In addition to the length and strength conditions, derechos acquire a distinctive bowlike shape on radar images; this one appeared as though the storm was aiming its arrow eastward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the storms are much more difficult to forecast, because the conditions that can lead them to form can be very subtle. And there’s overall less research on these storms than on their more dramatic cousins, tornadoes. “We have to rely on situational awareness,” Czarnetzki says. “Like people, sometimes you can have an exceptional storm arise from very humble origins.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Derecho radar &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The August 10 derecho, seen in radar images here as it moved across the Midwest (times are CDT) had a distinctive curved shape on radar, like a bow poised to shoot an arrow eastward. In some places, the storm had sustained winds of about 160 kilometers per hour, comparable to the wind strength of a Category 3 hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Aug. 10 derecho was particularly long and strong, with sustained winds in some places of up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles an hour). Still, such a strong derecho is not unheard of, Czarnetzki says. “It’s probably every 10 years you’d see something this strong.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether such strong derechos might become more, or less, common due to climate change is difficult to say, however. Some anticipated effects of climate change, such as warming at the planet’s surface, could increase the likelihood of more and stronger derechos by increasing atmospheric instability. But warming higher in the atmosphere, also a possible result of climate change, could similarly increase atmospheric stability, Czarnetzki says. “It’s a straightforward question with an uncertain answer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Atlantic hurricanes&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Laura roared ashore in Louisiana in the early morning hours of August 27 as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of about 240 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour). Just two days earlier, the storm had been a Category 1. But in the mere 24 hours from August 25 to August 26, the storm rapidly intensified, supercharged by warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hurricane Lauran satellite image&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090869&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline3_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090869&quot;&gt;Hurricane Laura intensified rapidly due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening from a Category 1 hurricane on August 25 to a Category 4 on August 26 (shown). The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas to expect a storm surge — ocean waters elevated by the storm above the normal tide level — of as much as five meters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090869&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic hurricane season is already setting several new records, with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration predicting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predictions-2020-atlantic-hurricane-storm-season-worse&quot;&gt;as many as 25 named storms&lt;/a&gt;, the most the agency has ever anticipated (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/7/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At present, 2005 still holds the record for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chances-atlantic-hurricane-season-busier-2005-are-slim&quot;&gt;most named storms&lt;/a&gt; to actually form in the Atlantic in a given season, at 28 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/22/18&lt;/em&gt;). But 2020 may yet surpass that record. By August 26, 13 named storms had already formed in the Atlantic, the most ever before September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The previous week, researchers pondered whether another highly unusual set of circumstances might be in the offing. As Laura’s track shifted southward, away from Florida, tropical storm Marco appeared to be on track to enter the Gulf of Mexico right behind it. That might have induced a type of physical interaction known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weather.gov/news/fujiwhara-effect&quot;&gt;Fujiwhara effect&lt;/a&gt;, in which a strong storm might strengthen further as it absorbs the energy of a lesser storm. In perhaps a stroke of good luck in the midst of this string of weather extremes, Marco dissipated instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Hurricane Laura approached landfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?start&quot;&gt;“unsurvivable” storm surges&lt;/a&gt; of up to five meters could inundate the Gulf Coast in parts of Texas and Louisiana. Storm surge is the height to which the seawater level rises as a result of a storm, on top of the normal tidal level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;hurricane debris in Lake Charles, Louisiana&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090868&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082720_cg_weather_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090868&quot;&gt;Debris litters Lake Charles, La., in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura’s landfall August 27.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090868&quot;&gt;AP Photo/Gerald Herbert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to attribute the fury of any one storm to climate change, but scientists have observed a statistically significant link between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11975&quot;&gt;warmer waters and hurricane intensity&lt;/a&gt;. Warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean, the result of climate change, juiced up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season&quot;&gt;2017’s hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;, including Irma and Maria, researchers have found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/28/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the Gulf of Mexico’s bathlike waters have notably supercharged several hurricanes in recent years. In 2018, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/whats-unusual-about-hurricane-michael&quot;&gt;Hurricane Michael&lt;/a&gt; intensified rapidly before slamming into the Florida panhandle (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/10/18&lt;/em&gt;). And in 2005, hurricanes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-and-fury&quot;&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and Rita did the same before making landfall (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/13/05&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for Laura, one contributing factor to its rapid intensification was a drop in wind shear as it spun through the Gulf.  Wind shear, a change in the speed and/or direction of winds with height, can disrupt a storm’s structure, robbing it of some of its power.  But the Gulf’s warmer-than-average waters, which in some locations approached 32.2° C (90° Fahrenheit), were also key to the storm’s sudden strength. And, by warming the oceans, climate change is also setting the stage for supercharged storms, scientists say. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Earth’s building blocks may have had far more water than previously thought</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090844</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-planet-building-blocks-more-water-once-thought</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earth’s deep stores of water may have been locally sourced rather than trucked in from far-flung regions of the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of meteorites from the inner solar system — home to the four rocky planets — suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba1948&quot;&gt;Earth’s building blocks delivered enough water to account for all the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buried within the planet&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, the water produced by the local primordial building material likely shares a close chemical kinship with Earth’s deep-water reserves, thus strengthening the connection, researchers report in the Aug. 28 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earth is thought to have been born in an interplanetary desert, too close to the sun for water ice to survive. Many researchers suspect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-did-earth-get-its-water&quot;&gt;ocean water got delivered toward the end of Earth’s formation by ice-laden asteroids&lt;/a&gt; that wandered in from cooler, more distant regions of the solar system (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/6/15&lt;/em&gt;). But the ocean isn’t the planet’s largest water reservoir. Researchers estimate that Earth’s interior holds several times as much water as is found at the surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether or not the material that formed Earth could have delivered this deep water, cosmochemist Laurette Piani of the University of Lorraine in Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France, and colleagues analyzed meteorites known as enstatite chondrites. Thanks to many chemical similarities with Earth rocks, these relatively rare meteorites are widely thought to be good analogs of the dust and space rocks from the inner solar system that formed Earth’s building blocks, Piani says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She and her team measured the abundance of hydrogen in these meteorites — a proxy for how much H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O they could produce — and calculated that local interplanetary debris had the potential to deliver at least three times as much water as is found in all the oceans. The meteorites don’t contain water, Piani says. Rather, they house enough of the raw ingredients to create water when heated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meteorites, the team also found a close match to the type of water found in Earth’s mantle. A smattering of all water molecules on Earth contain a heavy variant of hydrogen known as deuterium. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the enstatite chondrites lies within the range measured in Earth’s deep water. That similarity, the team argues, makes a strong case for local building blocks being the source of much of the planet’s water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This work is something I wanted to do myself or had been waiting for someone to do,” says Lydia Hallis, a planetary scientist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. In 2015, she led a team that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earths-water-originated-close-home-lava-analysis-suggests&quot;&gt;measured the deuterium abundance in lava plumes that tap deep into Earth’s mantle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/12/15&lt;/em&gt;). “I’m really happy that [the new data] sits within the region where our previous data from deep mantle samples is sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hallis and others stress that these new measurements are difficult. Once the meteorites hit the ground, they quickly absorb hydrogen from Earth’s environment. “They did a really good job of picking the right meteorites and making the right measurements,” she says. “This is pretty convincing that this hydrogen that’s measured is from the enstatite chondrites rather than from terrestrial contamination.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The enstatite chondrites could have also contributed a lot of water to the oceans as well — but they are not the full story. The deuterium-hydrogen ratio in ocean water, which is a bit higher than that of mantle water, is better matched to the ratio found in icy asteroids from the outer solar system. “We still need a bit of water coming from the outer solar system,” Piani says. So, while local materials may have delivered the bulk of Earth’s water, the oceans were likely topped off a bit later by collisions with remote space rocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Babies’ Moods Can Determine How Well They Remember Things They’ve Learned</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40135</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/27/babies-moods-can-determine-how-well-they-remember-things-theyve-learned/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the classic findings in memory research is that we’re better at remembering information when we’re in a similar context to that in which we learned it. This was perhaps most famously demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x?saml_referrer&quot;&gt;a 1975 study&lt;/a&gt;, which found that people who learned a list of words while scuba diving had better memory for the words when again underwater, compared to when on land (similarly, those who had learned the list on land were better at remembering it on land).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the external environment that matters: our internal states can also provide memory cues. For instance, people who were intoxicated when learning information were &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5774177/&quot;&gt;better at recalling that information when drunk&lt;/a&gt; than when sober, and there’s also evidence that our recall is better &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-32292-001&quot;&gt;when our mood matches how we felt at learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13444&quot;&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that the same is true even of babies in their first year of life. The findings have implications for understanding infant memory — and could even help to explain why we can’t remember anything from our early years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40135&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To look at state-dependent memory in babies, Sabine Seehagen and colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany recruited 96 nine-month-old infants and their caregivers. In the learning phase of the experiment, the babies watched a researcher perform a series of actions with an animal puppet: removing the puppet’s mitten, shaking it three times, then replacing it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a short break, there was a test phase where the infant had the opportunity to play with the puppet themselves. They had 90 seconds to do any of the three actions — i.e. remove the mitten, shake it, and replace it — though they weren’t prompted to do so in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, immediately before the learning and testing phases, the babies had a 5 minute play session designed to put them in a specific state of mind. Sometimes caregivers were instructed to play as calmly as possible with their infant and they were given quiet toys like a book and soft toy. Other times they were instructed to play as animatedly as possible, and given more active toys like a ball and swing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For one group of infants, the play sessions were the same before both learning and testing phases (i.e. calm both times, or animated both times). In another group, the play sessions were different (i.e. calm at learning and animated at testing, or vice-versa). And a third group only did the testing phase, without the learning part (this allowed the researchers to look at how often the babies performed the actions just by chance).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that infants who had the same kind of play before both learning and testing made an average of 1.47 actions during testing. This was significantly more than those whose play sessions were different, who only made an average of 0.59 actions. In fact, the babies in the latter condition didn’t seem to remember the actions at all: they performed no better than the babies who hadn’t even done the learning part of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that internal states do provide important cues for babies when they’re retrieving memories. And that seems to make sense: while older children and adults have a wealth of knowledge and experiences which allow them to use a variety of cues to trigger memories, young infants haven’t yet formed those connections. Relying on internal states to aid recall is therefore “highly adaptive”, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reliance on internal cues might also contribute to “infantile amnesia”, the fact that we’re unable to recall anything from our earliest years. As we grow our internal state changes considerably, and is never again going to match that of our first years of life — so, like the babies in the “different state” condition, we’re not able to access our memories.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that the research didn’t directly measure babies’ internal states, as the team acknowledges. During the animated play sessions, the babies did show significantly more movement and active behaviour than during the calm sessions. But further work will be required to see whether memory recall is truly dependent on infants’ emotions — it could be that the matching types of activity were somehow providing cues to the babies even without influencing their mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13444&quot;&gt; State‐Dependent Memory in Infants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Improved three-week weather forecasts could save lives from disaster</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090686</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-forecast-three-week-disaster-storms</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasters in the Philippines got the tip-off in the second week of November 2019. A precipitation forecast that peered further into the future than usual warned that the islands faced torrential rains more than three weeks away. The meteorologists alerted local and national governments, which sprang into action. Mobile phone and broadcast alerts advised people to prepare to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the time the Category 4 Typhoon Kammuri lashed the Philippines with heavy rains in early December, the damage was much less than it could have been. Having so much time to prepare was key, says Andrew Robertson, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society in Palisades, N.Y. “It’s a great example of how far we’ve come” in weather forecasting, he says. “But we still need to go further.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such efforts, known as “subseasonal forecasting,” aim to fill a crucial gap in weather prediction. The approach fits between short-term forecasts that are good out to about 10 days in the future and seasonal forecasts that look months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A subseasonal forecast predicts average weather conditions three to four weeks away. Each day of additional warning gives emergency managers that much more time to prepare for incoming heat waves, cold snaps, tornadoes or other wild weather. Groups such as the Red Cross are starting to use subseasonal forecasts to strategize for weather disasters, such as figuring out where to move emergency supplies when it looks like a tropical cyclone might hit a region. Farmers look to subseasonal forecasts to better plan when to plant and irrigate crops. And operators of dams and hydropower plants could use the information to get ready for extra water that may soon tax the systems.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Subseasonal forecasting is improving slowly but steadily, thanks to better computer models and new insights about the atmospheric and oceanic patterns that drive weather over the long term. “This is a new frontier,” says Frédéric Vitart, a meteorologist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On target &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A forecast made in the second week of November (top) foresaw heavy rains coming more than three weeks later over the Philippines, which did indeed arrive as Typhoon Kammuri (actual path shown, bottom).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Forecast vs. path of Typhoon Kammuri&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090697&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline4_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090697&quot;&gt;From top: ECMWF; Meow/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;The in-between&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasters are always pushing to do better. They feed weather observations from around the world into the latest computer models, then wait to see what the models spit out as the most likely weather in the coming days. Then the researchers tweak the model and feed it more data, repeating the process again and again until the forecasts improve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But anyone who tells you it will be 73° Fahrenheit and sunny at 3 p.m. four weeks from Monday is lying. That’s just too far out in time to be accurate. Short-term forecasts like those in your smartphone’s weather app are based on the observations that feed into them, such as whether it is currently rainy in Northern California or whether there are strong winds over central Alaska. For forecasting further into the future, what the rain or winds were like many days ago becomes less and less relevant. Most operational weather forecasts are good to about 10 to 14 days but no further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Evacuated residents in the Philippines&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090698&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline3_1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090698&quot;&gt;Early warnings of Typhoon Kammuri’s approach enabled safe evacuations of many thousands of residents of the Philippines in early December 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090698&quot;&gt;Ezra Acayan/Stringer/Getty Images News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few times a year, forecasters draw up seasonal predictions, which rely on very different types of information than the current weather conditions that feed short-term forecasts. The long-term seasonal outlooks predict whether it will be hotter or colder, or wetter or drier, than normal over the next three months. Those broad-brush perspectives on how regional climate is expected to vary are based on slowly evolving planetary patterns that drive weather over the scale of months. Such patterns include the intermittent oceanic warming known as El Niño, the extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and the amounts of moisture in soils across the continents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between short-term and seasonal prediction lies the realm of subseasonal prediction. Making such forecasts is hard because the initial information that drives short-term forecasts is no longer useful, but the longer-term trends that drive seasonal forecasts have not yet become apparent. “That’s one of the reasons there’s so much work on this right now,” says Emily Becker, a climate scientist at the University of Miami in Florida. “We just ignored it for decades because it was so difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Room to improve&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Short-term weather predictions and longer-term seasonal forecasts are relatively good. People need something in between, so researchers are trying to improve subseasonal forecasts, which look ahead a few weeks, using information from many sources, including predictable weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Chang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A global impact&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge stems from the fact that many patterns influence weather on the subseasonal scale — and some of them aren’t predictable. One pattern that scientists have been targeting lately, hoping to improve predictions of it, is a phenomenon known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MJO isn’t as well-known as El Niño, but it is just as important in driving global weather. A belt of thunderstorms that typically starts in the Indian Ocean and travels eastward, the MJO can happen several times a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An active MJO influences weather around the globe, including storminess in North America and Europe. Subseasonal forecasts are more likely to be accurate when an MJO is happening because there is a major global weather pattern that will affect weather elsewhere in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s still a lot of room for prediction improvement. The computer models that simulate weather and climate aren’t very good at capturing all aspects of an MJO. In particular, models have a hard time reproducing what happens to an MJO when it hits Southeast Asia’s mix of islands and ocean known as the Maritime Continent. This realm — which includes Indonesia, the Philippines and New Guinea — is a complex interplay of land and sea that meteorologists struggle to understand. Models typically show an MJO stalling out there rather than continuing to travel eastward, when in reality, the storms usually keep going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Distant effects &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Madden-Julian Oscillation is a pattern of storms that usually forms several times a year in tropical latitudes and can have weather repercussions around the globe. The MJO travels eastward along the equator as winds push warm, wet air high into the atmosphere, where the air dries out, cools and descends back toward the surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;Madden-Julian Oscillation&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Madden-Julian Oscillation&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090700&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline2_desktop_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090700&quot;&gt;Fiona Martin/Climate.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Madden-Julian Oscillation&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090699&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline2_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090699&quot;&gt;Fiona Martin/Climate.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Stony Brook University in New York, meteorologist Hyemi Kim has been trying to understand why models fail around the Maritime Continent. Many of the models simulate too much light precipitation in the tropics, she found. That light drizzle dries out the lower atmosphere, contributing to the overly dry conditions favored in these models. As a result, when the MJO reaches the Maritime Continent, the dryness of most models &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JD031139&quot;&gt;prevents the system from marching eastward&lt;/a&gt;, Kim and colleagues reported in August 2019 in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres&lt;/em&gt;. In real life, that rain doesn’t happen. With this better understanding of the difference between models and observations in this region, researchers hope to build better forecasts for how a particular MJO might influence weather around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you can predict the MJO better, then you can predict the weather better,” Becker says. Fortunately, scientists are already making those tweaks, by developing finer-grained computer models that do a better job capturing how the atmosphere churns in real life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meteorologist Victor Gensini of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb led a recent project to use the MJO, among other factors, to forecast tornado outbreaks in the central and eastern United States two to three weeks in advance. As the MJO moves across and out of the Maritime Continent, it triggers stronger circulation patterns that push air toward higher latitudes. The jet stream strengthens over the Pacific Ocean, setting up long-range patterns that are ultimately conducive to tornadoes east of the Rocky Mountains. In the June &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society&lt;/em&gt;, Gensini’s team showed that it can &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/101/6/E700/345594/The-Extended-Range-Tornado-Activity-Forecast-ERTAF&quot;&gt;predict broad patterns of U.S. tornado activity&lt;/a&gt; two to three weeks ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;High above the poles&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another weather pattern that might help improve subseasonal forecasts is a quick rise in temperature in the stratosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere, above the Arctic or Antarctic. These “sudden stratospheric warming” events happen once every couple of years in the Northern Hemisphere and much less often in the Southern Hemisphere. But when one shows up, it affects weather worldwide. Shortly after a northern stratosphere warming, for instance, extreme storms often arrive in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2019, one of these rare southern warmings, the largest in 17 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02858-0&quot;&gt;began over the South Pole&lt;/a&gt;. Temperatures soared by nearly 40 degrees Celsius, and wind speeds dropped dramatically. This event shifted lower-level winds around Antarctica toward the north, where they raised temperatures and dried out parts of eastern Australia. That helped set up the tinder-dry conditions that led to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-may-make-australia-wildfires-more-common&quot;&gt;devastating heat and fires across Australia&lt;/a&gt; in late 2019 and early 2020 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/1/20, p. 8&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to advanced computer models, forecasters at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne saw the stratospheric warming coming nearly three weeks in advance. That allowed them to predict warm and dry conditions that were conducive to fire, says Harry Hendon, a meteorologist at the bureau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stratospheric warming events last for several months. As with an MJO, a subseasonal forecast made while one of them is happening tends to be more accurate, because the stratospheric warming affects weather on the timescale of weeks to months. Meteorologists call such periods “forecasts of opportunity,” because they represent times when forecasts are likely to be more skillful. It’s like how it’s easier to predict your favorite baseball team’s chances for the season if you know they’ve just hired the best free agent around.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;A clearer picture&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are pushing wherever they can to eke out improvements in subseasonal forecasts. The European forecast center where Vitart is based has been issuing subseasonal predictions since 2004, which have been improving with time. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began issuing similar predictions in 2017; they are not as accurate as the European forecasts, but have been getting better over time. Meanwhile, scientists have launched two big efforts to compare the various forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitart and Robertson lead one such project, under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. Known as S2S, the meteorological shorthand for “subseasonal to seasonal,” the project collects subseasonal forecasts from 11 weather prediction agencies around the world, including the European center and NOAA. The forecasts go into an enormous database that researchers can study to see which ones performed well and why. Kim, for instance, used the database, among others, to understand why models have a hard time capturing the MJO’s march across the Maritime Continent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second effort, known as SubX, for the Subseasonal Experiment, uses forecasts from seven models produced by U.S. and Canadian research groups. Unlike S2S, SubX operates in nearly real time, allowing forecasters to see how their subseasonal predictions pan out as weather develops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That proved useful in early 2019, when SubX forecasts foresaw, weeks before it happened, the severe cold snap that hit the United States in late January and early February. Temperatures dropped to the lowest in more than two decades in some places, and more than 20 people died in Wisconsin, Michigan and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cold calculations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using a collection of forecasts known as SubX, scientists were able to predict an early 2019 cold snap descending on North America (left, turquoise) several weeks ahead of time (actual event, center, blue). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having an extra week’s heads-up that extreme weather is coming can be huge, Robertson says. It gives decision makers the time they need to assess what to do — whether that’s watering crops, moving emergency supplies into place or prepping for disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In just one example, Robertson and colleagues recently developed detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JD031374&quot;&gt;subseasonal forecasts of monsoon rains over northern India&lt;/a&gt;. He and Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at Columbia University, described the work in January in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Map of India&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090706&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline7_mobile_680_square.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090706&quot;&gt;C. Chang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the scientists focused on the Indian state of Bihar, where the regions north of the Ganges River are flood-prone and the regions to the south are drought-prone. Every week from June through September, the team worked with the India Meteorology Department in New Delhi to produce subseasonal rainfall forecasts for each of Bihar’s regions. The forecasts went to the state’s agricultural universities for distribution to local farmers. So when the summer monsoon rains arrived nearly 16 days later than usual, farmers were able to delay planting their rice and other crops until closer to the time of the monsoon, Acharya says. Such subseasonal forecasts can save farmers both time and money, since they don’t need to pay for irrigation when it’s not needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acharya is now working with meteorologists in Bangladesh to develop similar subseasonal forecasts for that country. There the monsoon rains typically start around the second week in June but can fluctuate — creating uncertainty for farmers trying to decide when to plant. “If we can predict the monsoon onset by around the mid or end of May, it will be huge,” Acharya says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Climate scientists and farmers in Northern India&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3090704&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082920_aw_forecast_inline6_1030.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3090704&quot;&gt;Nachiketa Acharya (front row, white sweater), Andrew Robertson (behind Acharya) and other climate scientists work with farmers and other residents of Bihar, a state in northern India, to develop and disseminate longer-term weather forecasts so that residents can plan when to plant and irrigate their crops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3090704&quot;&gt;N. Acharya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subseasonal forecasts can also help farmers improve productivity in regions such as western Africa, says Shraddhanand Shukla, a climate scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He leads a new NASA-funded project that is kicking off to help farmers better time their crop planting and watering. The effort will combine satellite images of agricultural regions with subseasonal forecasts out to 45 days. If farmers in Senegal had such information in hand back in 2002, Shukla says, they could have better managed their plantings in the run-up to a drought that killed many crops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As global temperatures rise and climate changes, meteorologists need to keep pushing their models to predict weather as accurately as possible as far in advance as possible, Vitart says. He thinks that researchers may eventually be able to issue forecasts 45 to 50 days in the future — but it may take a decade or more to get to that point. New techniques, such as machine learning that can quickly winnow through multiple forecasts and pinpoint the most accurate one, may be able to accelerate that timeline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no single breakthrough,” Becker says. “But there are a lot of little breakthroughs to be made, all of which are going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Mandatory mail-in voting hurts neither Democratic nor Republican candidates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3090805</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mandatory-mail-in-voting-democrat-republican-candidates</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mandatory mail-in voting leads to a slight uptick in voter turnout — for both Democrats and Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the conclusion that researchers came to after analyzing more than 40 million individual voting records from Utah and Washington — two states that have switched from in-person voting to almost exclusively mail-in voting over several years — as well as nearly 30 years of nationwide county-level voting data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding, published August 26 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances, &lt;/em&gt;suggests the current political zeitgeist that &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7685&quot;&gt;mail-in voting benefits one party over another is false&lt;/a&gt;, says political scientist Michael Barber of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. When voters cast ballots by mail, he says, “neither party is hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Utah and Washington do not reflect voting patterns in the country as a whole, the authors note, because Washington leans blue and Utah red, the two states demonstrate how mail-in voting could affect voter turnout by party. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;With the country in the midst of a pandemic, policy makers and public health experts have proposed voluntary mail-in voting as one way for Americans to safely vote in November. And many states have made such voting easier. A recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; analysis shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/?itid=ap_katerabinowitz&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_8&quot;&gt;over 80 percent of voters in the country can now cast their ballots by mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some Republican voters especially are wary of the process. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup poll from May 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that 83 percent of Democratic respondents were OK with their state allowing all residents to vote by mail, but only 40 percent of Republicans were. In a separate question, 76 percent of Republicans said mail-in voting would lead to more fraud compared with 27 percent of Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barber and John Holbein, a political scientist and public policy expert at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, combed through multiple datasets to understand how mail-in voting has influenced voter turnout overall and by party in recent decades. The researchers first identified counties in six states that adopted more universal mail-in voting procedures from 1992 to 2018, namely mailing all constituents a ballot before Election Day and limiting or eliminating in-person voting. Those states were Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Colorado and Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using census data, the researchers identified the total number of eligible voters in the counties that adopted mail-in voting and those nationwide that did not. The team then compared voter turnout across counties by looking at election data showing how many eligible voters actually cast a ballot in each midterm or presidential election during that quarter century. Barber and Holbein also compared turnout within a given county before and after the implementation of a vote-by-mail policy. Another dataset, Dave Leip’s Atlas of Elections, enabled the researchers to evaluate each party’s share of votes per county in midterm and presidential elections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then drilled down into individual voting patterns for Washington and Utah. Altogether, the researchers evaluated more than 40 million voting records from 2012 to 2018 in Utah and from 2002 to 2016 in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individual data from Washington and Utah showed voter turnout increased slightly for Democrat, Republican and independent voters. And the county-level analysis likewise showed that mail-in voting led to a 1.8 to 2.9 percentage point increase in voter turnout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partisan vote shares in counties that adopted mail-in voting tilted 0.7 percentage points in favor of the Democratic Party, the team found. But with the margin of error in the results between –0.7 and 2 percentage points, that increase was not statistically significant and could potentially go in either direction in any given election, Barber says. As it was, only 1.5 percent of analyzed counties had an electoral margin as narrow as 0.7 percentage points between parties anyway, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors used “best statistical practices” by corroborating their nationwide, county-level results with the individual results from Washington and Utah, says Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. But “I’m not sure that Republican leaders would be willing to concede 0.7 percentage points,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broad geographic analyses of this sort can obscure smaller communities, adds political scientist Jean Schroedel of Claremont Graduate University in California. Her work shows that mail-in voting disenfranchises Native Americans on reservations, many of whom lack regular mail access and have a long-standing distrust of nontribal government entities. “Native people don’t trust voting — full stop — but they really don’t trust voting by mail,” Schroedel says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if states sort out how to protect the vote of vulnerable community members, such as keeping some physical polling places open, the findings may do little to allay other recent concerns over mail-in voting, Barber acknowledges. Those include fears over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html&quot;&gt;United States Post Office’s ability to keep pace&lt;/a&gt; with such a huge influx of mail and the possibility of mail-in ballots getting thrown out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90534923/voting-by-mail-is-secure-but-it-has-a-seriously-low-tech-downside-your-signature&quot;&gt;having an allegedly faulty signature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness&quot;&gt;arriving late&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what’s going to happen in 2020 with vote by mail,” Barber says. “This has gotten so unnecessarily messy.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Author Interview: Arunima Malik on Global Effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18348</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/-NFg9bVWp4w/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Arunima Malik and an international team of researchers recently assessed how the Coronavirus pandemic has caused worldwide consumption losses amounting to more than US$3.8 trillion while simultaneously spawning the largest recorded drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Their &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;paper, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235654&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global socio-economic losses and environmental gains from the Coronavirus pandemic&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;” highlights the inherent dilemma of the global socio-economic system and the need for increased global cooperation and solidarity. Read on to see their thoughts on the need to move beyond discipline boundaries, the effects of their research on policy and more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The list of authors on this article spans the globe, with researchers affiliated with Australia, Japan, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, United States, and the United Kingdom. Can you speak on how this team was formed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AM: The assessment presented in our published study was undertaken in the Global Industrial Ecological Virtual Laboratory — a cloud computing environment that brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and universities to foster new and innovative research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We formed the multi-regional multi-disciplinary team to allow us to capture insights and data related to COVID-19 for not just English, but also for a range of languages. We followed a three-tier approach to enable us to best capture global events related to the pandemic. We note in the manuscript: “In addition to English, and in alphabetical order, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish were used in our search, thus covering languages spoken by over 5 billion people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drives you in your field of research, and why do you believe your research is important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AM: I am passionate about understanding impacts embodied in complex supply chains. It’s important to be able to understand how systems are interconnected, and how effects in one system ripple through other systems. Sustainability applies to us all, and I enjoy being able to contribute to this evolving field of research. Regarding the current pandemic, these ripple effects have been further emphasized on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of your research? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AM: My research is interdisciplinary as it brings together concepts and methodologies from a range of disciplines. It is therefore important to have structures that support interdisciplinary review and dissemination of results. There is a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research for understanding complex sustainability-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact is your research having in your scientific community, in the media, and more widely? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AM: Research in supply chain analysis is definitely gaining relevance, and we are now starting to see the use of input-output tables by organisations for sustainability assessments. Input output analysis has been used in the reports published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Stockholm Environment Institute — such as the report on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sei.org/publications/spillovers-sdg-implementation-soy-argentina/&quot;&gt;Argentina-EU soy supply chain&lt;/a&gt; regarding impacts on Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Comments from the Editor&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/people/bing-xue&quot;&gt;Bing Xue&lt;/a&gt;, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany, speaks on the importance of Arunima’s research and supply chain analyses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BX: The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, triggering a great debate in the economic circles on the impact of the epidemic. As a result of the lockdown and other measures taken by various countries to deal with the pandemic, the supply chain at the enterprise level was disrupted, which led to the shutdown of global value chain trade, specifically in terms of consumption loss, income loss and employment loss. At the same time, due to the ripple effect of supply chain disruption, some polluting companies have reduced output, reducing GHG and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which has a positive impact on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the world as a cohesive whole, global MRIO-based supply-chain analyses helps to clearly understand the different impacts on countries in different positions of global value chain. The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on some important conditions for the rise and rapid progress of economic globalization, stimulating the restructuring of global value chains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is more important is the orderly development of economic globalization after the pandemic. Based on the perspective of the global industrial chain, how to cope with the impact of the outbreak and spread of the pandemic on the supply chain is an issue that should be concerned by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would like to thank Arunima and Bing for their research and for taking the time to provide their thoughtful comments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&quot;A subscription service to view the items, which date from 1792 to 1960, was temporarily suspended by Manx National Heritage (MNH) during the Covid-19 lockdown in April.

More than 30,000 pages were viewed that month.

A recent survey showed strong support for access to remain free.

The collection, which can be accessed through the iMuseum, contains more than 400,000 pages of newsprint....

Gaynor Haxby of MNH, said the digital collection had been &quot;exceptionally popular&quot; with people from &quot;across the world&quot;, including America, South Africa and Australia.

There were more than 10,600 visits to the website in April, up from 766 in March, she added.

There are now plans to digitise more contemporary newspapers, subject to fundraising for the £270,000 project....&quot;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: More Entitled People Get Angrier After Experiencing Bad Luck</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40124</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/26/more-entitled-people-get-angrier-after-experiencing-bad-luck/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had the experience of losing our temper when being treated unfairly by someone else. And while anger isn’t the most pleasant emotion, it can be a useful social tool to signal to another person that we’re not happy with how they’re acting towards us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about when we suffer because of bad luck, rather someone else’s actions? In that case it would seem to make little sense to get mad. And yet, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304967&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences &lt;/em&gt;finds that a certain group of people are more likely to show anger in such situations: those who feel like they are particularly entitled in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40124&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Psychological entitlement is essentially a belief that you deserve more than others. People who score highly in entitlement tend to think that others should be accommodating of their own needs and schedules, for instance, and are more likely to see themselves as being mistreated. When their high expectations aren’t met, they can experience reduced wellbeing and feelings of anger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a series of studies, Emily Zitek from Cornell University and Alexander Jordan from Harvard Medical School looked at whether these emotional effects of entitlement extend to situations solely involving bad luck. First, the pair asked 162 participants to fill in the Psychological Entitlement Scale, which asks respondents to rate their agreement with statements like “I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others”.  Participants were also asked how good they would expect their luck to normally be when rolling dice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were then told that they would be randomly allocated by dice roll to either a fun task (rating comic strips) or a boring task (counting the letters in a paragraph). In reality, all participants were told they had had “bad luck” and been assigned to the boring task. They then rated how unjust they felt this was, and indicated how angry they were.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that those higher in entitlement had a stronger feeling of injustice and greater levels of anger. More entitled participants also generally expected to experience better luck when rolling dice, suggesting this is another instance where entitled people have (unrealistically) high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a second study, participants were asked to recall either a time when something bad had happened to them solely because of bad luck, or when someone had treated them unfairly. They then indicated how fair and just they felt the event was, and rated their feelings of anger. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People high in entitlement again showed greater anger than those low in entitlement when recalling an instance of bad luck. But when remembering an instance of unfair treatment, those high and low in entitlement showed similar levels of anger. That is, entitlement again seemed to be an important factor in determining anger after bad luck, but not when there was a specific individual to blame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers looked at how entitlement related to feelings of anger and pity when &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; experiences bad luck. Participants read a scenario in which their flight had been cancelled and the airline was randomly selecting a customer to hop onto another plane with a spare seat. In one scenario they were told that they had been unlucky and someone else had been picked; in another they were the lucky one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the participants read that they had had bad luck, higher entitlement was once again related to greater feelings of anger. Unsurprisingly, participants didn’t feel much anger when they were assigned the seat and the other person was unlucky. But they did experience pity towards that person — and interestingly, those with a greater sense of entitlement reported &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; pity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the studies suggest that entitled people expect to have good luck, and get angry after experiencing bad luck — even though by definition there is no-one to direct that anger towards. (The authors do acknowledge it’s possible that people implicitly blame God or some higher power for their bad luck).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what are the consequences of experiencing anger in those situations? The researchers suggest that feelings of anger and injustice could reinforce people’s sense of entitlement, though they add that there could be benefits too — if anger motivates someone to try and improve their performance in the future, for instance (though that may be difficult in cases where a bad result is purely down to luck).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it remains to be seen how the results translate to the real world. In most cases an instance of “bad luck” doesn’t occur in isolation, but often in a social setting — so it would seem prudent to examine whether this kind of anger is taken out on others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304967&quot;&gt;Individuals higher in psychological entitlement respond to bad luck with&lt;br /&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144996</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I described topics of conversations to have with a teenager leaving home for college. Equally, if not more important, is the process of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the positive power of a strong family foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. The power of a supportive family is almost unlimited.  Let me be clear that a family does not need to consist of a heterosexual mother and father, 2.5 children, and a golden retriever. A family is a group of people who are committed to one another for the long run, based on their love. If students understand that no matter what, they can depend on their family, any transition will be easier. Research supports this view: the same study of anxiety and depression during the pandemic revealed that family support was associated with fewer psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop your family communication skills.&lt;/strong&gt;  The first step in the communication process may sound simple at first: listen. Too many parents, especially when anxious, tend to lecture, perhaps the worst possible strategy for communicating with teens.  You can express your emotions first, not to meet your needs but to normalize a conversation about feelings.  A parent can open a conversation with a statement like,  “I know this is a hard time for most of us, and I know I’m a bit worried. How are you feeling?” In this way, you acknowledge that it is OK to be frightened or anxious. Listening takes time, accepting some silence, and it isn’t always easy. Your teen may brush you off at first—that’s okay, there will be other opportunities. Keep the lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept that communication may change&lt;/strong&gt;. Flexibility will be key for a positive transition to college.  You may hear from your child less often: embrace that as growth. He is learning to depend on other people for support, expanding his social world.  He may primarily use texting or short phone calls when he’s walking.  You also have the right to let your child know that you need to hear from them now and then.  But don’t invade their space by reading their Instagram or Twitter. You can respect their privacy and if you want to learn more about campus life, subscribe to the student newspaper or check the college website. Other students, especially during these uncertain times, may want to stay connected and text or call often. If you already text or talk on the phone with your teen frequently, the contact may stay the same or increase. They are letting you know what they need. There is no absolute right or wrong rate of communication, especially during the first few months of the college transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. It is axiomatic in mental health that if a parent feels psychologically healthy, so will a child.  To support your student, they need to feel that you are OK, that they can leave knowing that the situation at home is solid. This doesn’t mean that your family will be free of stress, but that you will be able to cope or find solutions to problems that arise. This is called “self-efficacy.” You may have lost your job or suffered financial setbacks during this time, or worse, lost a loved one to COVID-19. And you are probably going to miss your child. You may be under additional pressure if you are a single parent, a member of a minority group, or if you work on the front lines of healthcare or a service industry. It also appears that mothers who work outside the home may also be doing the lion’s share of the housework and educational needs of their children. Try to take time for yourself by establishing &lt;strong&gt;daily&lt;/strong&gt; relaxing rituals, like short meditations or breathing exercises or listening to music. Reach out to your partner, a close friend or relative for support. Just as your child needs care, so do you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a time for all of us to focus on values, on what matters most. For most of us, family and education are fundamental. Parents can help their college-age children move through this unexpectedly difficult transition, and we all need to take care of one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit:&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/lovely-teenage-with-grandmother-home_5432734.htm&quot;&gt; Image&lt;/a&gt; by jcomp via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/&quot;&gt;Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/634481516/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/634481516/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/dont-blame-ai-for-the-a-levels-scandal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don’t blame AI for the A-Levels scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How Making Sacrifices For A Partner — Or Saying You Will — Affects Wellbeing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40117</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/25/how-making-sacrifices-for-a-partner-or-saying-you-will-affects-wellbeing/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You were hoping to go out with friends on Saturday night, but your partner really wants to have a quiet night at home instead…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your life’s going great, but then your partner is offered their dream job in a town you’d happily never visit, let alone live in…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? Do you stand your ground? Or you do you sacrifice your own goals for the sake of your partner’s?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a dilemma familiar to anyone who’s ever been in a relationship. It would seem reasonable, then, to assume that research could tell us what the likely impacts would be on individual wellbeing, and on the health of the relationship itself. However, as the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-51177-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; point out, there are two conflicting hypotheses for how sacrifices should pan out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40117&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The “benefit hypothesis” holds that making sacrifices can relieve tension in a relationship and help to build a climate of trust and cooperation. According to the “burden hypothesis”, however, when one partner sacrifices a personal goal, and compromises on their autonomy, their own wellbeing takes a hit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Francesca Righetti at the Free University of Amsterdam led work that set out to look at what actually happens. And the results are fascinating: if you feel that you would &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; that they would), it’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Righetti and her colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 82 sets of data on sacrifice and wellbeing in relationships, comprising more than 32,000 people. Only some of the data, collected in nine different countries, had previously been published, and just over half of the data sets came from studies that included same-sex couples, with the rest exclusively focused on mixed-sex couples. The team looked at four different facets of sacrifice: willingness to sacrifice (saying that in theory, you would), behavioural sacrifice (actually sacrificing), satisfaction with a sacrifice and costs of a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that when someone reported being willing to make a particular hypothetical sacrifice for their romantic partner, this was linked not only to higher personal wellbeing (more positive emotional states and greater life satisfaction) but also higher “relationship wellbeing” scores both from that individual and also their partner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results in relation to actual sacrifices were striking, though. Though the relationship wellbeing scores weren’t affected, the individual’s personal wellbeing ratings were lower when they made more frequent sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that reporting a general willingness to sacrifice and actually regularly making sacrifices for your partner are two very different things — a reported willingness “may only weakly correspond to actually performing these sacrifices in everyday life,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data did also reveal, however, that when people said they gained  satisfaction from giving up their own goals and preferences in favour of their partner’s, they tended (unsurprisingly) to report more positive personal and also relationship wellbeing than if they had not felt satisfied with their sacrifice. Similarly, when the personal costs of a sacrifice were reported to be higher, the individual’s personal and relationship wellbeing scores also tended to be lower. (This difference may relate simply to the size of the sacrifice — going with your partner’s plans for Saturday night vs agreeing to move to another town or country, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thus,” the team writes, “although results aligned with the benefit hypothesis when considering willingness to sacrifice and satisfaction with sacrifice, data were consistent with the burden hypothesis when considering behavioural sacrifices and costs of sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found some gender-related effects. The associations between all four facets of sacrifice and personal and relationship wellbeing were more negative for women than for men. Why? The team suggests that women typically make more sacrifices than men do and so, when they do sacrifice, they may receive less appreciation and gratitude from their partner, and also society in general, than men. Consequently, women may have less positive attitudes towards sacrifice than men, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why, though, should a reported &lt;em&gt;willingness&lt;/em&gt; to sacrifice be linked to various benefits, when actual sacrifices were not?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feeling willing, in theory, to sacrifice may of course be linked to having a stronger relationship in the first place. Also, people who feel like this may be generally more prosocial in other ways, which could enhance their partner’s own wellbeing and perceptions of the relationship itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-51177-001&quot;&gt;The link between sacrifice and relational and personal well-being: A meta-analysis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: PhD in Computational &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2020-08-25:/2020/08/25/phd-in-computational-cognitive-neuroscience.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2020/08/25/phd-in-computational-cognitive-neuroscience.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PhD in Computational &amp;amp; Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-year full-time PhD studentship includes a stipend of £15,285 per annum in addition to covering tuition fees. Only EU and UK citizens are eligible to apply.
The start date of the PhD will be January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PhD will be supervised by Dr Shabnam Kadir (University of Hertfordshire), Dr Elena Antonova (Brunel University London), Prof Robert Leech (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London), and Prof Chrystopher Nehaniv (University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested candidates are encouraged to make informal inquiries with Dr Shabnam Kadir (&lt;code&gt;s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk&lt;/code&gt;) before making a formal application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply, submit &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf&quot;&gt;an application form&lt;/a&gt; (downloadable from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) together with a cover letter, CV, and scanned copies of  university transcripts and degree certificates (BSc, and if relevant MSc) via email to &lt;code&gt;doctoralcollegeadmissions AT herts.ac.uk&lt;/code&gt;, cc-ing Dr Kadir on &lt;code&gt;s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk&lt;/code&gt; and Dr Antonova on &lt;code&gt;elena.antonova AT brunel.ac.uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Date for the applications: 28 September 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Here’s How Feelings Of Optimism Change As We Age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40105</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/24/heres-how-feelings-of-optimism-change-as-we-age/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a commonly held notion that young people are more hopeful about the future than any other group — you might have heard this referred to, either positively or negatively, as “youthful optimism”. Even Jane Austen picked up on it: “There is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions”, she wrote in &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is this actually the case? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300738&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from William J. Chopik and colleagues published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;, optimism actually continues growing well past youth — and it’s only later in life that it begins to decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40105&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The team was interested in how optimism changes with age — and how life events might affect that trajectory. They gathered data from three longitudinal studies of people aged between 16 and 101: one from the Netherlands (10,045 participants), one from Germany (42,691 participants) and one from the United States (22,150 participants).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Dutch and American studies optimism was tracked using a six-item measure, with participants rating how much they agreed with statements including “I expect more good things to happen” or “I rarely count on good things”. In Germany, participants rated how optimistic or pessimistic they were about the future on a scale from 1 to 4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at sixteen life events concerning children (e.g. childbirth, or a child leaving home), relationships (e.g. getting married or divorcing,), parents (loss of a parent), moving house, health, and employment (e.g. getting a job for the first time or retiring). The team then measured variance in the optimism measure from 2006 to 2016, mapping it against these life events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that “youthful optimism” isn’t quite as accurate a concept as we might assume: in fact, younger adults were &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; in optimism than middle aged people. This hopefulness then plateaued until later life, when optimism started to decline again. This also held for pessimism, which was highest among older adults and sharply decreased as young adults reached middle age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It might not fit our assumptions about optimism, but it does make sense that optimism increases into middle age. As we get older we have more and more experience of success, whether that’s in our careers or our personal lives. We’re more likely to know what we want out of life and may also feel in control of the future – hence feeling more optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This pattern was different in the German sample, however, where younger adults were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; optimistic than their middle aged counterparts: the team suggests this may be down to social and cultural changes between generations specific to Germany.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Predictably, optimism was sometimes related to positive events and pessimism to negative events — if you’ve experienced chronic illness, unemployment or bereavement it makes sense you’d have less hope for the future. However, results weren’t consistent between samples and were not all so straightforward: for instance, negative changes in health were associated with &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; levels of optimism in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These inconsistent results could be because life events were simply categorised as either “occurred” or “did not occur”, which may not pick up on the nuances of how people actually experience things. A break-up, for example, might be a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; life event for somebody in a miserable relationship; similarly, leaving the parental home may be more or less emotionally significant depending on person and context. Future research could look at categorising life events more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limitations aside, the results do suggest that human beings tend to be fairly optimistic for most of their lives. As Chopik &lt;a href=&quot;https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/study-shows-humans-are-optimists-for-most-of-life/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, this resilience is a cheering thought. “We often think that the really sad or tragic things that happen in life completely alter us as people,” he said. “But people diagnosed with an illness or who go through another crisis still felt positive about the future and what life had ahead for them on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656620300738&quot;&gt;Changes in optimism and pessimism in response to life events: Evidence from three large panel studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer. In their recently published study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mensah and Adjei look at how gender and the level of welfare provision by the state impact the association between work-life balance and self-reported health. The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

&lt;p&gt;The world is more connected than ever thanks to social media, but what role might it play in medical and surgical research? &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01072-1/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asks whether Twitter is effective as a tool to aid recruitment to surgical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12088 alignright&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/charles-deluvio-FdDkfYFHqe4-unsplash-300x291.jpg&quot; width=&quot;212&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clayton &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12094 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/shahan-khan-WyIsEBjuhKg-unsplash-scaled-e1597749164531-270x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;189&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Plant Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms. An understanding of these mechanisms may prove useful in future efforts to promote stress tolerance in commercially important crops like sugar beet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Arnett describes &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929382.001.0001/acprof-9780199929382&quot;&gt;emerging adulthood&lt;/a&gt; as a distinct stage of development from the late teens through the twenties; a life stage in which explorations and instability are the norm. As they focus on their self-development, emerging adults feel in-between, on the way to adulthood but not there yet. Nevertheless, they have a high level of optimism about what the future holds for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current climate, emerging adults are facing more instability than ever before. Whether it’s starting university, forging new relationships, or entering the job market – the uncertainty surrounding these milestones has presented many new challenges, and exacerbated the more common anxieties of adjusting to change. We’ve put together a reading list of books that address some of the key issues facing emerging adults – in areas such as education, work, relationships, and mental health – and provide advice and approaches for managing this turbulent stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mood-prep-101-9780190914301&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Prep 101: A Parent’s Guide to Preventing Depression and Anxiety in College-Bound Teens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Carol Landau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book answers the question most parents have – “What can we do?” – when it comes to college-bound teens who may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression. This timely book empowers parents by providing strategies for helping their children psychologically prepare for college and adulthood, as well as by addressing and alleviating the anxiety parents themselves may feel about kids leaving home for the first time. Landau shows parents how they can promote healthy communication and problem-solving skills, and how they can help young people learn to better regulate emotions and tolerate distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;408&quot; src=&quot;https://d1pawtlfzz7188.cloudfront.net/60fafaa33598a1337dec1988d6b2b205e4f5afc8fe35371270bc309699f96bf0/EU7D-9nEPVo.jpg?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;amp;Expires=1597332007&amp;amp;Signature=SXf8uEz8myKuqHlBLgClWW+G8TKK7TVXOHfJbqG9kk4llzm8IRJBjQ94rVp0mmB/D7on4h1u9kSNivVLy8eDlLv5RQS17/QsvsnbswWEhejZ2QP/oJ1x0wuyH/1UswcF48Xa2yP9als7Huv+94mHpXo0i8R7L8F6UXuyCE2iGw3Md6F+wHLX+if+FblEwCEV4dfZ8++DR5kgDZ6CsimN8YTBGi538phOrug9biJAOeZpxHcL1K4dLPFXuhJ1Qwt4of4VzkknlgFTYivA5l84vM1n7VGg72BIfbkC+iWqV7T75dD0JZMjERo6qqVbPpF+NYJNUcgwNxfXR4lBGrDDpw==&amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJAX54V4IT7A2GGEA&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognitive-skills-you-need-for-the-21st-century-9780197529003&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Skills You Need for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Reed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can young people today prepare for the workplace of the future? Stephen Reed discusses a Future of Jobs report that contrasts trending and declining skills required by the workforce in the year 2022. Trending skills include analytical thinking and innovation, active learning strategies, creativity, reasoning, and complex problem solving. This book aids undergraduate and graduate students in planning their education by recommending courses and projects that will help them to gain important 21st century skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mindfulness-for-the-next-generation-9780190905156&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness for the Next Generation: Helping Emerging Adults Manage Stress and Lead Healthier Lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Holly Rogers and Margaret Maytan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College students and other emerging adults today experience high levels of stress as they pursue personal, educational, and career goals. These struggles may increase the risk of psychological distress and mental illness. This book describes an evidence-based approach for teaching the useful and important skill of mindfulness to emerging adults. The manualized, four-session program outlined here, Koru Mindfulness, is designed to help young people navigate challenging tasks, and achieve meaningful personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-science-of-college-9780190934507&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Science of College: Navigating the First Year and Beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Patricia Herzog et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book aids entering college students—and the people who support them—in navigating college successfully, with up-to-date recommendations based upon real student situations, sound social science research, and the collective experienc&lt;img height=&quot;425&quot; src=&quot;https://d1pawtlfzz7188.cloudfront.net/60fafaa33598a1337dec1988d6b2b205e4f5afc8fe35371270bc309699f96bf0/EaordcLunxg.jpg?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;amp;Expires=1597332007&amp;amp;Signature=i4Nqm4aGV/2zXByBILEGq13HODc2v/2gty1t7OKuol0k0no1qD1Po5vDMoIkFy0Rmi9vY8+bdWQHfGadKY2Y7XNoOJPGIcsv1k3q5hLt+JOKRQktjUz+DSa6k2MHVlHn1hp4d1f4ZttB/0AKO75730uRnfE+1iJpa65XsTD4U7QhX7dno1g+0g7T4X5C+fYfNWwaskt//I52I49UCgnPLnjFgSkgH97y6KLuTS3fszG9XlgPq64lBJ+EbrvWfSTw4CuuES4NtVeTN9JIbfSxDfCz7lzb+b0fP7fRLGxZh4jlzgTNS6Ocf7q83b4nzpqyHugiiTsZCUuzHI6d4UQ+3w==&amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJAX54V4IT7A2GGEA&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;es of faculty, lecturers, advisors, and student support staff.

These books have highlighted just some of the ways in which young people, and their loved ones, can implement strategies to adapt and build resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/C7B-ExXpOIE&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by Javier Allegue Barros via Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633987626/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633987626/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fd1pawtlfzz7188.cloudfront.net%2f60fafaa33598a1337dec1988d6b2b205e4f5afc8fe35371270bc309699f96bf0%2fEU7D-9nEPVo.jpg%3fresponse-content-disposition%3dinline%26amp%3bExpires%3d1597332007%26amp%3bSignature%3dSXf8uEz8myKuqHlBLgClWW+G8TKK7TVXOHfJbqG9kk4llzm8IRJBjQ94rVp0mmB%2fD7on4h1u9kSNivVLy8eDlLv5RQS17%2fQsvsnbswWEhejZ2QP%2foJ1x0wuyH%2f1UswcF48Xa2yP9als7Huv+94mHpXo0i8R7L8F6UXuyCE2iGw3Md6F+wHLX+if+FblEwCEV4dfZ8++DR5kgDZ6CsimN8YTBGi538phOrug9biJAOeZpxHcL1K4dLPFXuhJ1Qwt4of4VzkknlgFTYivA5l84vM1n7VGg72BIfbkC+iWqV7T75dD0JZMjERo6qqVbPpF+NYJNUcgwNxfXR4lBGrDDpw%3d%3d%26amp%3bKey-Pair-Id%3dAPKAJAX54V4IT7A2GGEA&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633987626/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/why-chemical-imbalance-is-the-wrong-way-to-talk-about-depression/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why chemical imbalance is the wrong way to talk about depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We Find Some Word Sounds More Emotionally Arousing Than Others</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40093</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/20/we-find-some-word-sounds-more-emotionally-arousing-than-others/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all “cross-modal” findings, the most famous is surely the bouba-kiki effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the sound &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and spiky shapes with &lt;em&gt;kiki&lt;/em&gt;. However, research has not yet revealed why this effect is common among adults who speak very different languages — and even in infants as young as four.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various theories have been put forward. One holds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/&quot;&gt;levels of emotional arousal may be key&lt;/a&gt; — that both &lt;em&gt;kiki &lt;/em&gt;and a spiky shape trigger relatively high levels of arousal, compared with &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and a blob. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, provides compelling evidence for this idea. The researchers also take their findings further, arguing that they could have important implications for understanding the early evolution of languages.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40093&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For an initial study, Arash Aryani at Freie Universität Berlin and colleagues presented English-speaking students (at Cornell University, US) with shapes and words taken from previous studies that have investigated the bouba-kiki effect. (For example, &lt;em&gt;maluma&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;takete&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=870792&quot;&gt;the original 1929 report &lt;/a&gt;of this word/shape effect). In each case, the participants had to use a five-point scale to rate how calming or exciting they considered these words or shapes to be. The results revealed significantly higher arousal ratings for kiki-type than bouba-type words and shapes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the team asked a fresh group of participants to use the same scale to rate 940 computer-generated pseudo-words (which were all spoken in a neutral tone by an actor) for how arousing they sounded. These pseudo-words all sounded like they could be English words, but they had no meaning (think &lt;em&gt;tylo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sooking&lt;/em&gt;, for example). Separately, the team analysed them, looking for particular acoustic features that earlier work has suggested we use to infer different emotional states. (For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0990&quot;&gt;variations in the fundamental frequency of even animal sounds lead us to infer different emotions&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly-pulsating sounds are associated with high arousal.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear relationship — those pseudo-words that the researchers expected, based on their acoustic analysis, to trigger more arousal received higher arousal ratings from the participants. The same was true for low arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then applied the acoustic model to the specific bouba-like and kiki-like words that they’d used in the first experiment. They found that the model predicted significantly higher arousal values for the kiki-like words than for the bouba-like words. This suggested, then, that the acoustic features of &lt;em&gt;bouba&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;kiki&lt;/em&gt; (and similar pairs) explain the low vs high arousal ratings given by the participants in the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, the results suggest that, no matter what the word (or pseudo-word), depending on its acoustic features, it will trigger different perceptions of arousal. “Any wordlike stimulus can potentially convey emotional information solely on the basis of its perceptual acoustic characteristics, making it possible to match it with emotionally similar concepts, eg. shapes,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of the second experiment, the researchers then identified groups of “high-arousal”, “medium-arousal”, and “low-arousal” pseudo-words. They asked a fresh batch of participants to match these to a range of spiky and rounded shapes (again taken from previous studies). As the team predicted, spiky shapes were most likely to be matched to high-arousal pseudo-words (followed by medium-arousal and then finally low-arousal examples), while rounded shapes were most likely to be matched to the low arousal group. “These results suggest that the extent to which a word in a bouba-kiki experiment is matched with a rounded shape or spiky shape depends on the level of arousal elicited by its sound,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings not only support the emotional arousal theory to explain the bouba-kiki effect but may also shed light on the early stages of language evolution, they add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding that humans can reliably identify levels of arousal in the vocal sounds of a range of animals is telling, they think. “An initial form of vocalisation might have been a motor reflection of arousal in the vocal tract. Such vocalisations might gradually have been used to refer to external objects that were associated with similar affective experience.” So a sharp rock could become associated with high-arousal sounds (and note the “sharp” sound of &lt;em&gt;rock&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;bubble&lt;/em&gt;, say.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If our early speech sounds and words were grounded in our emotional, arousal system, this could have made them easier to learn, and so more likely to be retained, the team thinks. And though most words are often held up to be arbitrary, there’s increasing evidence that this is often not the case — our word sound/meaning links go deeper than the onomatopoeia of &lt;em&gt;crack&lt;/em&gt; for instance, or the ideogram of &lt;em&gt;zigzag&lt;/em&gt;, and can, it seems, be grounded in our emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620927967&quot;&gt;Affective Arousal Links Sound to Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Reminders Of God Don’t Actually Encourage Us To Take Risks, Replication Study Finds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40080</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/19/reminders-of-god-dont-actually-encourage-us-to-take-risks-replication-study-finds/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv&quot;&gt;Sofia Deleniv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This passage, pulled from Isaiah 41.10, is just one example of the Bible’s many references to God’s power to protect. And this protective persona might affect you much more than you think. At least that’s what emerged in 2015, when researchers from Stanford University published a string of studies finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614563108?casa_token=kI9UANJRFMQAAAAA%3AE1UVVQWf5QHj2jSgvhawv2kDn6w8rhexo14CmTI74rZziCnSeA-CSasanAo4lYHhFm6GvR1MF3Xe&quot;&gt;people prompted to think of God made significantly riskier decisions&lt;/a&gt; — whether or not they were religious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scientists’ explanation, promptly picked up by the media, was that thinking of God makes risk-taking less intimidating because it primes us to expect divine protection. As of recently, however, this narrative has not stood up to scrutiny. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477&quot;&gt;first pre-registered replication of this study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that the effect was probably no more than an exciting false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40080&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The failure to replicate such a high-profile experiment will probably come as a disappointment. The original publication had certainly generated a global splash, giving rise to headlines like &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/religion-makes-people-take-or-avoid-risks-skydiving-versus-drinking-gambling-sex.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God is my co-pilot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/social-justice/thank-god-for-risky-behavior&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God for risky behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;”. &lt;/em&gt;In many ways, the study stated a convincing case. It featured nine experiments, all of which concurred that being reminded of God triggered a significant increase in people’s tendency to take on risk. In these experiments, a mix of religious and non-religious participants from across the US were prompted to think either of God or an unrelated topic, such as astronomy. In most cases, this was achieved by having participants solve scrambled sentences, which either contained religions words (e.g. “spirit” or “divine”) or non-religious words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then indicated how likely they were to engage in a range of risky behaviours related to ethical dilemmas (like taking credit for someone else’s work), safety concerns (driving a car without a seatbelt) or social risk (starting a whole new career in one’s mid-thirties). The effects seemed clear. Those who had been primed to think of God were significantly more likely to consider engaging in risky behaviours, as long as these did not involve an ethical transgression. Moreover, participants in the “God-prime” condition perceived significantly less risk in all of these behaviours, as if thinking of God really had reduced the sense of threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some researchers were concerned. Looking at the string of statistical results, many of which had just made it over the threshold of significance, one couldn’t help but wonder — what if this divine protection effect was just a statistical blip? The answer arrived a few weeks ago, when Will Gervais from the University of Kentucky and colleagues repeated two of the original 2015 experiments in exact detail, but with one crucial difference. They recruited a substantially larger sample of over a thousand participants, which was designed to give the researchers a very strong probability of detecting the “God-prime” effect, if it did really exist. Their study revealed no evidence that being primed to think of God had the power to make people choose riskier behaviours. There was no effect even when the authors ran a mini meta-analysis combining their own findings with those of the original publication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, this failed replication has not been met with the media attention that surrounded the original paper. Perhaps that study struck a chord because it resonated with our long-held ideas about the function of religion. Many sociologists and psychologists believe that religion helps individuals deal with stress by offering a padding of divine protection, which makes the chaos and volatility of daily life less frightening. Indeed, the “God comfort hypothesis” has received considerable support from international surveys, which find that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx,%20https:/doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0021140&quot;&gt;national levels of religion tend to go hand-in-hand with governmental instability and poor material security&lt;/a&gt;. Strife might directly throw previously unbelieving people into the arms of God. This was observed in Christchurch, New Zealand, where researchers spotted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049648&quot;&gt;sudden spike in religiosity&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of its devastating 2011 earthquake. Thus, when researchers discovered that the sense of security associated with God not only gives us perceived shelter from risk, but actually emboldens us to seek it out, their findings might have enjoyed some degree of automatic credibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But experience should have taught us that caution is the better policy. Researchers have failed to replicate a host of high-profile discoveries,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/&quot;&gt;from the controversial effects of “power posing”&lt;/a&gt; on our confidence and stress hormones, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/16/another-social-psychology-classic-bites-the-dust-meta-analysis-finds-little-evidence-for-the-macbeth-effect&quot;&gt;Macbeth Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that having our moral purity threatened makes us literally want to clean ourselves. As psychological science works to recover from its replication crisis, and scientific editors increasingly realise the importance of publishing negative results, communicators of popular science may need to be careful about overstating the certainty of new and exciting findings. As with the God-priming effect, some discoveries might not be scientific scripture after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620922477&quot;&gt;Do Religious Primes Increase Risk Taking? Evidence Against “Anticipating Divine Protection” in Two Preregistered Direct Replications of Kupor, Laurin, and Levav (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; (bottom) surface of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fusiform gyrus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the fusiform face area and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the late 1990s, researchers had built up a fair amount of evidence that suggested there are parts of our brain that are especially active when we look at faces. This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers published a groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt; that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&lt;/a&gt; to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fusiform gyrus&lt;/a&gt;—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the &lt;em&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/em&gt;, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as &lt;em&gt;prosopagnosia&lt;/em&gt;, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery&lt;/a&gt;, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caused disruptions in the perception of faces&lt;/a&gt;. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term &lt;em&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/em&gt;—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/&quot;&gt;some argue&lt;/a&gt; that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/&quot;&gt;a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well&lt;/a&gt;. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the &lt;em&gt;expertise hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased&lt;/a&gt; in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts&lt;/a&gt; viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA&lt;/a&gt; when viewing x-rays than med students did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Musings On Music: Seven Insights From Psychology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40074</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/18/musings-on-music-seven-insights-from-psychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music and humans go back a very long way. The earliest accepted instruments, made from bones, appear on the European scene about 40,000 years ago. But for perhaps at least a million years before that, our ancestors had the throat architecture that in theory would have allowed them to sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All kinds of ideas have been put forward for why and how music came to matter so much to us. But what’s abundantly clear is that it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter; there isn’t a society out there that doesn’t make and listen to music. And new research is now revealing all manner of psychological and neurological effects…&lt;span id=&quot;more-40074&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But what about people who don’t like music?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is a human universal, but it’s true — not everyone enjoys music. In fact, as a 2014 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; revealed, some perfectly healthy people can perceive music just like anybody else, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00133-X?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096098221400133X?showall=true&quot;&gt;their reward-related neural circuits don’t respond to it&lt;/a&gt;. (These circuits do still respond to food or money, for example, so it’s not that they’re generally defective).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/31/2/118/62587/Individual-Differences-in-Music-Reward-Experiences&quot;&gt;estimated 3-5% of people&lt;/a&gt; experience “musical anhedonia”, and get no pleasure from music. (To find out where you sit on the music reward spectrum, you could fill in the team’s questionnaire, available &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainvitge.org/z_oldsite/bmrq.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Last year, a team that included some of the same researchers published a follow-up study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/25/5018&quot;&gt;found a neurobiological basis for their earlier observations&lt;/a&gt;: differences in the white matter “wiring” that connects the auditory cortex and the ventral striatum, a key part of the reward system. What causes these differences is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the rest of us, what is it about a piece of music that gives us pleasure?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a team led by Vincent Cheung at the Max-Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31258-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982219312588?showall=true&quot;&gt;analysis of responses to 745 US Billboard pop songs&lt;/a&gt;. They found that expectancy is key. When listeners were pretty certain about which chord to expect next (based on what had come before), they found it pleasurable to be surprised. When they weren’t sure what to expect, though, more predictable subsequent chords were pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular songs strike a good balance between both subverting expectation and reassuring listeners, the team concluded. “It is fascinating that humans can derive pleasure from a piece of music just by how sounds are ordered over time,” Cheung commented. It is also important for understanding how music influences our emotional state…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do we like listening to sad music?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point to stress is that we don’t all necessarily like it. In 2016, a team led by Tuomas Eerola at the University of Durham &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157444&quot;&gt;reported on the emotional experiences connected with sad music&lt;/a&gt; of 2,436 people in the UK and Finland. The majority said they enjoyed sad music, and that this pleasure boosted their mood. “However, there are people who absolutely hate sad-sounding music and avoid listening to it,” notes Eerola. The study revealed that for these people, sad music was associated with painful personal experiences, such as loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the reports of mood-&lt;em&gt;boosting&lt;/em&gt; effects from the majority is important. In 2015, a paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295&quot;&gt;Sad as a Matter of Choice?&lt;/a&gt;” reported that people with depression were more likely to listen to sad songs — which the team controversially took to imply that they were maintaining or even worsening their own low mood. Last year, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001&quot;&gt;a study published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that depressed people prefer sad music because it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/24/why-do-people-with-depression-like-listening-to-sad-music/&quot;&gt;calming and even uplifting&lt;/a&gt;. As some participants in another recent study commented, when you’re feeling low, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/&quot;&gt;sad music can seem like a supportive friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extreme emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pieces of music have dramatic effects on us. “Peak emotional states” involve powerful physical responses, such as tears, or feeling “the chills”, and often extreme sadness or joy. They can be triggered by something inherently deeply meaningful — such as childbirth — but also by a beautiful view, or piece of music. A 2017 study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/02/psychologists-have-studied-whats-happening-when-music-gives-us-chills-or-makes-us-cry/&quot;&gt;explored these reactions&lt;/a&gt;, and found that song-induced tears were associated with subsequent calming — they seem, then, to have a cathartic, relieving function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, though, are more prone than others to feeling goosebumps or a shiver down the spine in response to a piece of music. And as a paper recently published in &lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; has revealed, such people have &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/884/2223400&quot;&gt;stronger connectivity between auditory processing and social and emotional processing areas&lt;/a&gt; of the brain. These same connectivity differences have also been linked to greater empathy. As the researchers write in their paper: “Perhaps one of the reasons why music is a cross-culturally indispensable artifact is that it appeals directly through an auditory channel to emotional and social processing centers of the human brain.” Only, it does this more for some of us than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connecting brains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposed adaptive function for music is that it unites individuals. With music, we can march together, dance together, and express emotions as one. And there’s now growing evidence that this unity can occur right down at the neural level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, Ulman Lindenberger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and colleagues reported that when two guitarists play the same piece of music together, their brainwaves synchronise. Big deal, you might think: they’re processing and playing identical notes, so why shouldn’t there be similarities in their brain activity? However, in 2012, the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00312/full&quot;&gt;reported a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; involving duets with &lt;em&gt;different &lt;/em&gt;guitar parts. When these pairs had to actively coordinate their playing, there was a synchronisation in activity in some regions &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the two. This, the team concluded, was evidence of “inter-brain networks”. “When people coordinate actions with one another, small networks within the brain and, remarkably, between the brains are formed,” noted Johanna Sänger, lead author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, more evidence of inter-brain synchronisation during musical experiences has emerged. It’s known that when audience members are enjoying a piece of live music, their brainwaves tend to synchronise. And, earlier this year, a team led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/&quot;&gt;when a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, a synchronisation in brain activity develops.&lt;/a&gt; The team were even able to use the strength of this “inter-brain coherence” to predict how much the audience reported enjoying a piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use the beat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are unique as a species in being able to perceive beat. And there’s all kinds of evidence that the tempo of a piece of music affects our behaviour. A classic study, published back in 1986, found that diners in a Dallas restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489234?seq=1&quot;&gt;ate significantly faster&lt;/a&gt; when faster tempo (more beats per minute) music was played, compared with slow tempo music. These findings went on to influence the choice of soundtracks in restaurants the world over. But there’s also recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00074/full&quot;&gt;evidence that listening to high-tempo music while exercising can increase heart rate&lt;/a&gt; more than slow-tempo music and also make the exercise feel less difficult. “This means that the exercise seemed like less effort but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,” commented researcher Luca P. Ardigò of the University of Verona in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who likes to have background music playing while you work, there are a couple of studies worth bearing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening even to music that you enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.1731&quot;&gt;can interfere with working memory&lt;/a&gt;, which could impair mental arithmetic, a study published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has found. And though it has been suggested that music can encourage creativity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3532&quot;&gt;in fact it “significantly impairs” it&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2019 paper published in the same journal. The researchers, from the UK and Sweden, gave participants verbal insight problems, which are meant to tap into creativity. (For example, they were given the words “dress”, “dial”, and “flower”, and asked to identify a single word that could be combined with each — “sun”). Background music with foreign lyrics, instrumental music without lyrics and music with familiar lyrics &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;made the participants worse at this. Again, the researchers think that this is because music disrupts working memory; in this case, verbal working memory. “To conclude, the findings here challenge the popular view that music enhances creativity, and instead demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content, consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the negative impact of familiar music was observed even when a participant said it boosted their mood, reported liking the song, or said that they typically studied with background music playing. So if you do typically work with music, and think it helps, surely it’s worth at least trying to go without.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Small Pleasures Are Just As Important For Our Wellbeing As Long-Term Goals</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/17/small-pleasures-are-just-as-important-for-our-wellbeing-as-long-term-goals/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to leading a happy and fulfilled life, many of us focus on long-term goals: what job we want, whether or not we want children, or how to reach a certain level of skill at a particular hobby or interest. There’s a reason so much research looks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;how to achieve&lt;/a&gt; the things you value in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, we often (try to) eschew short-term pleasures, deeming them a distraction from loftier goals. But according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220941998&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the pursuit of those more immediate pleasures could be just as important for our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The ability to engage in short term pleasures might not be the same for everybody, reasoned the researchers, Katharina Bernecker from the University of Zurich and Daniela Becker from Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien. In other words, some people may be more liable to fail at achieving short-term pleasurable goals because they’re too focused on long-term ones. So in the first study, the team developed a self-report scale to assess individual differences in this ability to pursue “hedonic” goals. Questions measured hedonic success, or how well people manage to pursue short term pleasures (e.g. “in my spare time, I can relax well”), and intrusive thoughts about long term goals whilst engaging in short term pleasures (e.g. “I cannot stop myself from thinking about things I still need to do”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next pair of studies, the team used the scale to investigate whether people with high or low hedonic capacity experience greater wellbeing. In the first, participants answered questions from the World Health Organization wellbeing scale, which measures cognitive and emotional wellbeing, while in the second, participants completed the Satisfaction With Life scale, rating themselves on items like “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”. Hedonic capacity and self-control were assessed in both, as were physical symptoms (e.g. dizziness and faintness), including those of depression and anxiety (e.g. “nervousness or shakiness inside”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ hedonic capacity was significantly and positively related to both general wellbeing and life satisfaction: people with a greater capacity to pursue short-term pleasures were also happier in their lives. Self-control (which is needed to achieve long-term goals) was also positively associated with wellbeing, but the effect of hedonic capacity was greater. Greater hedonic capacity was also related to fewer physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third study, hedonic capacity was measured before participants took place in a ten minute relaxation session, during which they stated how many intrusive thoughts they experienced. Before and after this session, participants rated how relaxed, tense, or alert they felt. As expected, those with higher levels of hedonic capacity experienced fewer intrusive thoughts during the relaxation phase; in addition, people who experienced more intrusive thoughts didn’t find the session as relaxing as those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the findings in a real life setting, a fourth study recruited participants in specific contexts — e.g. a cafe, park or in a yoga class. Participants filled in a survey assessing their hedonic capacity and trait self-control, and indicated how much they were enjoying themselves in the moment and their reasons for being there. Companions of the participants also filled in a questionnaire judging the participants’ pleasure in the moment. Again, those with high hedonic capacity reported having a more positive experience and were also judged by others as having a better experience. A further study confirmed these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while a focus on long-term goals and self-control may increase wellbeing, it seems as if short-term pleasures are also a key factor — though intrusive thoughts can hamper this process, as results from the third study suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, self-control is important to some degree — giving in to every whim you experience probably isn’t going to equal a particularly healthy existence, as the team notes: a balance between the two is likely to result in higher levels of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the sort of person who finds it hard to enjoy short-term pleasures and are more likely to experience intrusive thoughts, this balance might be harder to come by than you might hope. But giving yourself permission to eat, drink and be merry could do more for your wellbeing than you might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144946</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues. Important for parents to let this information guide their conversations. Their teenagers will feel validated and supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/student-leaving-school-after-classes_1314101.htm&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633749722/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633749722/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/dont-blame-ai-for-the-a-levels-scandal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don’t blame AI for the A-Levels scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-communities-can-help-stop-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How communities can help stop COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We really struggle to wrap our heads around the idea of exponential growth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200812-exponential-growth-bias-the-numerical-error-behind-covid-19&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we tend to rely on our intuitions and think of growth as linear even when it is not — which could help to explain why many people underestimated the dangers of coronavirus spreading. Researchers say that politicians and the media should be doing more to try and highlight the exponential nature of transmission in an attempt to correct this mathematical bias.&lt;span id=&quot;more-40058&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a lot of the country, this week has been unpleasantly hot. &lt;/strong&gt;And aside from the physical risks, heatwaves can have a variety of effects on our mental health, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/heatwaves-dont-just-give-you-sunburn-they-can-harm-your-mental-health-too-121203&quot;&gt;writes Harriet Ingle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To combat global problems like climate change, we need to alter our behaviour in ways that might come at a personal cost, even though they benefit the wider community&lt;/strong&gt;. So how do you encourage people to adopt these prosocial attitudes? Making people feel guilty is not the answer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/you-want-people-to-do-the-right-thing-save-them-the-guilt-trip&quot;&gt;explains Claudia R Schnieder&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;. Her research has found that appealing to positive emotions, such as pride in doing the right thing, is more effective at encouraging pro-environmental and prosocial behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists studying animals have traditionally examined how the brain responds to sensory information, or how patterns of brain activity directly relate to an animal’s behaviour. &lt;/strong&gt;But now they’re beginning to look at something altogether more complex: the way in which neuronal activity is related to an animal’s internal state, such as its emotions or drives. At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02337-x&quot;&gt;Alison Abbott has written a fascinating feature&lt;/a&gt; on the challenges of probing an animal’s frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A systematic review has found that, for a small number of people, mindfulness and meditation can have unwanted effects like a worsening of anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2251840-mindfulness-and-meditation-can-worsen-depression-and-anxiety/&quot;&gt;reports Clare Wilson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Other researchers say that the study shouldn’t put people off doing meditation, but suggest they do it in a safe context such as guided meditation sessions. For more on mindfulness, it’s worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/&quot;&gt;checking out our podcast&lt;/a&gt; from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey reef sharks form surprisingly strong social ties&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902157235/everyone-needs-a-buddy-even-sharks&quot;&gt;report Christopher Intagliata&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that the sharks form groups of up to 20 individuals, who they hang out with for years. Being part of a social group gives the sharks certain advantages, such as learning from others where to hunt for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, I missed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-correlation-causation-taboo&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; last month from Neuroskeptic (whose posts are always worth reading). &lt;/strong&gt;We all know that correlation does not equal causation — but a paper argues that considering causal inference “taboo” simply results in psychologists making these claims in a more subtle or implicit way. The researchers examined influential studies based on observational data and, as Neuroskeptic puts it, “find evidence of unstated causal claims and assumptions, swept under a correlational rug.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: The Shape Of A Glass Can Influence How Much We Drink</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen the government take measures to try and limit people’s consumption of sugary drinks and other unhealthy foods. Take the so-called “sugar tax” placed on soft drinks, for instance, or the proposal to ban adverts for junk food before the 9pm watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists hope that small changes in design can also help “nudge” people into healthier behaviours. For example, a study from last year found that the order in which drinks are presented on the McDonald’s menu could &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/&quot;&gt;encourage people to choose the sugar-free options&lt;/a&gt; more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the shape of a glass could also subtly influence people’s drinking behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40050&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past work had found that people were slower to drink both beer and soft drinks from glasses with straight sides compared to those with outward-sloping sides. But it was unclear whether there was any effect on the total amount consumed or exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the shape of a glass should have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, Tess Langfield from the University of Cambridge and colleagues conducted a series of experiments using different shaped glasses. First, the team gave 198 participants a fizzy apple drink in either a straight-sided tumbler, or one with sides that sloped outwards. The participants were allowed to drink at their leisure while watching a nature documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_40053&quot; style=&quot;width: 823px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Langfield et al (2020)&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-40053&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;40053&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Langfield et al (2020)&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=823&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;823,398&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/13/the-shape-of-a-glass-can-influence-how-much-we-drink/langfield-et-al-2020/&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/langfield-et-al-2020.png&quot; width=&quot;823&quot; /&gt;The glasses used in the first study (left; each glass contains 330ml of apple drink) and second and third studies (right; each glass contains 165ml of passion fruit drink). Via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;Langfield et al (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found no difference in the total time participants spent drinking from each kind of glass. But those who drank from the sloping glass did show a more “decelerated” pattern of drinking: they tended to drink more of the drink in the first half of the session than the second half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were then asked to fill the glass until it was half-full. Those with the sloping glass tended to underestimate where the midpoint was compared to those with the straight-sided glass. That makes sense: if a glass slopes outwards, there is more volume at the top than at the bottom, so the midpoint is higher that it might initially seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest glass shape could influence people’s pace of drinking, and potentially their perceptions of how much they’ve had to drink. But they don’t reveal anything about the actual amount consumed. So in a second study, the team asked participants to perform a (fake) taste-test, rating four passion fruit drinks, half served in straight-sided champagne flutes and half in sloped martini glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants did indeed drink significantly less from the champagne flutes than the martini glasses. They also took smaller sips from the champagne flutes. This time, however, glass shape didn’t influence people’s accuracy at finding the midpoint of the glass, suggesting that this kind of perceptual bias couldn’t explain why people drank less from the straight-sided glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers wondered whether the results could be related to the physical shape of the lips when sipping from each kind of glass. So in a final experiment, they had participants drink from the champagne and martini glasses while their face was rigged up with electrodes to measure muscle activity. The team found that people’s lips were more pursed when sipping from the straight-sided flute than the sloped martini glass, and there was some evidence that pursing the lips more was related to taking smaller sips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the study suggests that sloping glasses can cause us to drink more of a soft drink — but this seems to be due to the way the shape affects the actual mechanics of how we sip from a glass, rather than the result of perceptual biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should health-conscious bars and restaurants start chucking out their sloping glasses? Well, it seems pretty clear that more work needs to be done in real world settings. Drinking in a bogus taste-test in the lab — particularly when hooked up to electrodes — is a far cry from how people might consume soft drinks in daily life. And it remains unclear whether the results hold for alcohol as well as soft drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two studies also used glasses which normally have quite specific purposes: they’re used for serving sparkling wine and cocktails. Could participants’ associations with those drinks have influenced their behaviour? Maybe they’re used to sipping slowly on champagne, for instance, while more readily knocking back martinis. Unlikely, perhaps, but it seems worth also exploring the effects of glasses with novel designs that are free from these kinds of existing associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the study shows that the design of our drinkware is worth examining in the context of public health. And even small “nudges” could theoretically have a large impact at a population level, particularly alongside other measures. “In combination with other behaviour change strategies, adopting straight-sided glasses may prove to be one intervention contributing to the many needed to reduce consumption of drinks that harm health,” the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70278-6&quot;&gt;Glass shape influences drinking behaviours in three laboratory experiments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144924</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted&quot;&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder&quot;&gt;granted clemency&lt;/a&gt; and Brown was released from prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742&quot;&gt;leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims&lt;/a&gt;, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9&quot;&gt;can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color&lt;/a&gt;, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10&quot;&gt;which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and pressure them to waive their rights&lt;/a&gt;—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9&quot;&gt;often perceived&lt;/a&gt; as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2&quot;&gt;often blamed&lt;/a&gt; for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11&quot;&gt;more likely to be tried in adult criminal court&lt;/a&gt; rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back&quot;&gt;Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/&quot;&gt;Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How education could reduce corruption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-criminal-justice-systems-big-data-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The criminal justice system’s big data problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1&quot;&gt;Food security&lt;/a&gt; – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm&quot;&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food insecurity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to &lt;a href=&quot;https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/&quot;&gt;prior studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing disparities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18344</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ihd7XnvNt8g/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/08/plos-and-liblynx-partner-to-develop-open-access-analytics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Official PLOS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: “Successful” Psychopaths Learn To Control Their Antisocial Impulses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40043</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/12/successful-psychopaths-learn-to-control-their-antisocial-impulses/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be familiar with the concept of the “successful psychopath”. Like regular psychopaths, such people are callous and manipulative, self-seeking, and free from guilt — but rather than ending up behind bars, they are able to flourish in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, though the concept of the successful psychopath is popular, it’s also contentious. That’s because there’s been a lack of data to substantiate it, or to explain it. But now, ten years after &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/08/18/hunting-the-successful-psychopath/&quot;&gt;an initial study hinted that levels of the personality trait of conscientiousness might be important&lt;/a&gt; for understanding the path to “successful” vs criminal psychopathy, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45069-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment&lt;/em&gt;, provides more robust support for that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40043&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work published back in 2010 started with a survey of psychology and law specialists, criminal attorneys and professors of clinical psychology in the US. These people were asked if they’d ever known someone who matched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hare.org&quot;&gt;Robert Hare’s definition of a psychopath&lt;/a&gt;, but who was successful in life. If so, they were asked to provide personality and psychopathy assessments for them. One key difference between successful and standard psychopaths emerged: successful psychopaths were reported as having higher levels of conscientiousness. Rather than being impulsive and irresponsible, they seemed to be more self-disciplined and driven to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion was based solely on reports of people who thought they knew someone who fitted the bill, however. Now Emily Lasko and David S. Chester at Virginia Commonwealth University have studied relatively successful vs unsuccessful psychopathic individuals directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair used a total of seven years of data on 1,354 American adolescent offenders for their study. As all of these adolescents had initially committed a serious offence (such as sexual assault or a weapons offence), the “successful” vs “unsuccessful” distinction was tied to re-offending. Adolescents who did not re-offend were classed as “successful”, whereas those who’d re-offended at least once were deemed to be “unsuccessful”. Every six months during the study, the adolescents completed surveys of psychopathic traits and also separate measures of their ability to control their impulses and suppress feelings of aggression, as well as self-reporting any offences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasko and Chester found that participants who’d initially scored highly for grandiose-manipulative psychopathic traits (traits associated with arrogance and self-centredness as well as manipulativeness) went on to show steeper increases over time in two forms of conscientiousness: impulse control and the suppression of aggression. Importantly, this effect was notably larger within the “successful” group. It seems, then, that successful psychopaths are those who show real improvements at controlling their impulses, to achieve their goals. “This exacerbated development of conscientiousness-defining traits is likely able to compensate for the heightened antisocial tendencies of these psychopathic individuals, bringing them into a self-regulatory balance that enables them to function in society,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tried altering the number of re-offences that led to an individual being categorised as successful vs unsuccessful, but this did not materially change the pattern of the results. As an alternative measure of “success”, they also considered whether or not participants were enrolled in school at each time point. The link between conscientiousness-related traits and success held. “This suggests that our findings are likely to generalise across various forms of ‘success’,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, more work will be needed to investigate the factors contributing to the development of greater or poorer impulse control, and how to enhance it in this population, perhaps to increase the proportion of relatively successful rather than criminal psychopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the research supports the idea of “successful” vs regular psychopaths, as well as finding evidence for a key difference between the two. “These findings show the importance of the five-factor model to understanding the nuances of psychopathy and its various phenotypes,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-45069-001&quot;&gt;What makes a “successful” psychopath? Longitudinal trajectories of offenders’ antisocial behavior and impulse control as a function of psychopathy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&quot;Now no-one wants ForBetterScience to become an all-Papermill channel.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Prefer Strangers Who Share Their Political Views To Friends Who Don’t</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40038</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/11/people-prefer-strangers-who-share-their-political-views-to-friends-who-dont/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendship tends to be based on some kind of shared experience: growing up with someone, working with them, or having the same interests. Politics is an important factor too, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413510932&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that we can be pretty intolerant of those with different political positions — not an ideal starting point for friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can have a significant and tangible impact. One Reuters/Ipsos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-relationships-insight/from-disputes-to-a-breakup-wounds-still-raw-after-u-s-election-idUSKBN15M13L&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found 16.4% of people had stopped talking to a family member or friend after Trump was elected, while 17.4% had blocked someone they care about on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you find out a trusted friend has different politics to you? They don’t fare well, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407520939191&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt; authored by Elena Buliga and Cara MacInnis from the University of Calgary, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40038&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited from across the political spectrum: 70 identified as Republicans, whilst 142 described themselves as Democrats. As well as reporting their political identity, participants rated their opinions on social and economic policy, on a scale from very liberal (0) to very conservative (10). They also rated how important their political orientation is to their identity and completed a “feeling thermometer”, which measured  how favourably or unfavourably they felt towards members of other political parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the pre-test measures were complete, participants were presented with four vignettes in a random order. In the first, participants were asked to imagine meeting someone at a party with the same political views as them; another vignette detailed the same experience, only this time the potential friend had &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final two vignettes, participants were instructed to think about a real or hypothetical close friend whose views they were not already aware of and asked to imagine a conversation in which their friend outlined their political beliefs. In the first, participants imagined their friend espousing a shared political belief, while in the second they turned out to be a member of a political out-group instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading each of the four vignettes, participants rated how excited, happy, pleased, satisfied, surprised, upset, anxious and worried they would feel in the situation and answered questions on how willing they would be to maintain that friendship (e.g. “would you make an effort to spend time with this person?”). They also rated their trust and satisfaction in, and hope for, the ongoing friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants indicated how much they would expect their feelings to change towards the person in each vignette, as well as rating attitudes towards them from “extremely unfavourable” to “extremely favourable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, people were more positive towards in-group members than out-group members: participants had more trust in and hope for the longevity of relationships with both friends and strangers of the same political leanings as them than they did even for established friends with different politics. Positive emotions were highest when discovering a friend had shared beliefs, followed by the stranger with shared beliefs. Out-group friends and out-group strangers tailed behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative affect was also highest for the friend with different political views, followed by the out-group stranger. This makes sense — you’re likely to be much more invested (and therefore much more disappointed) in a friend than someone you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t clear, however, who exactly participants were imagining when asked to think of a friend, meaning there may have been significant variation in closeness and therefore in emotional response; some participants may also have been thinking of a hypothetical friend, which could also have had an impact on the results. The measures also only looked at immediate reactions — it’s very possible that after discovering a friend is of a different political persuasion,  participants could calm down or mellow out over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably also important to note that the results aren’t necessarily going to represent every relationship — lots of people have cherished friends with very different politics to their own. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; those relationships are successfully managed and navigated may be one focus for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407520939191&quot;&gt;“How do you like them now?” Expected reactions upon discovering that a friend is a political out-group member&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People May Only Notice They’ve Become More Active After More Frequent Vigorous — But Not Moderate — Physical Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40034</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/10/people-may-only-notice-theyve-become-more-active-after-more-frequent-vigorous-but-not-moderate-physical-activity/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new habit isn’t always easy — we probably only have to look at our own history of failed &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;New Year’s Resolutions&lt;/a&gt; to know that. One common frustration is that things don’t happen fast enough — we start doing something that’s supposedly good for us but don’t see a significant behaviour change as quickly as we’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certainly seems to be the case with exercise, at least according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01530/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology. &lt;/em&gt;It found that people only feel they’ve become more active when they increase the amount of &lt;em&gt;vigorous&lt;/em&gt; activity they do —  if it’s moderate, they don’t feel like they’ve changed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40034&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the first study, Hermann Szymczak from the University of Konstanz and colleagues collected data from 605 participants taking part in a longitudinal study looking at health behaviour. First, participants were asked to report their physical activity for each of the last 7 days: vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity and walking. Six months later, participants also reported their perceived change in physical activity since the first time point, choosing one statement they felt best summed up their behaviour: “yes, I became more physically active”, “no, but I tried to become more physically active”, “no and I have not tried” and “no, because I was already physically active before”. At both time points, objective fitness was measured via a bicycle test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, the same data was gathered from 382 participants from two more time points in the longitudinal study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that those who said their behaviour had changed (“changers”) showed an increase in &lt;em&gt;vigorous&lt;/em&gt; activity of about 52 and 86 minutes per week in the first and second studies respectively. Changers did not exhibit any changes in &lt;em&gt;moderate&lt;/em&gt; activity, however. This suggests that an increase in intense physical activity is much more influential in making people feel that their behaviour has changed. (Changers also showed increased fitness in the bicycle test, at least in the first study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious ramifications to these findings. If people only see vigorous activity as a worthwhile endeavour, it could lead to some pushing themselves too hard — and it could put others off completely, meaning they lose the many benefits of even light exercise. Previous research has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-006-1014-4&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; this might be the case, so developing public service messaging that makes clear the health benefits of non-intense exercise might have a serious impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at fitness norms — what narratives exist about moderate and intensive exercise, and how are they disseminated? This could go some way towards understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people don’t feel a difference with moderate exercise, as well as informing any changes in messaging to boost motivation and encourage even small behaviour changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the team also notes, perceived behaviour change is a key part of actual behaviour change: if people see positive developments in themselves or their skills, they’re both more likely to believe the changes will last and more able to commit. Thinking about and implementing small changes in behaviour, therefore, may be particularly useful if you’re looking to maintain a habit in the long term. And if you’re feeling bad about a day or week off exercise? Don’t worry — vegging out is just as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/16/forgive-yourself-for-relaxing-in-front-of-the-tv-and-the-couch-time-might-actually-do-you-some-good/&quot;&gt;necessary&lt;/a&gt; sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01530/full&quot;&gt;An Increase in Vigorous but Not Moderate Physical Activity Makes People Feel They Have Changed Their Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144911</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths&quot;&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589&quot;&gt;biologically-based disorders&lt;/a&gt;, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm&quot;&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf&quot;&gt;$69/person for schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines&quot;&gt;28 FDA-approved medications for depression&lt;/a&gt; versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be. In that same &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; where we found that suicide was the leading cause of death, we found that an eating disorder was never listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Instead, we saw causes such as heart and liver failure in a 39-year-old woman who weighed less than half what a woman her age and height should weigh – less than half. In the absence of universal screening, we lose our best opportunity to prevent those deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to recognize eating disorders as serious mental illnesses that pose a threat to the health of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need better health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more funding for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need universal screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Daan Stevens via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yGUuMIqjIrU&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633090054/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633090054/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144910</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Future of Jobs Report 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt;. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf&quot;&gt;approximately 30%&lt;/a&gt; of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

The functionality of the simulator has been greatly expanded by the addition of a number of features that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world is designed for —  and by — extraverts, forcing introverts to try and adapt to society&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/introverts-are-excluded-unfairly-in-an-extraverts-world&quot;&gt;writes Noa Herz&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s unfair to place the onus on introverts, Herz argues, writing that simple changes could make work and educational settings more welcoming places for a group that makes up around a third of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40026&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness can manifest differently according to your age group, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/people-experience-loneliness-differently-depending-on-their-age/&quot;&gt;reports Amy Barrett&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers looking at data from thousands of adults in the Netherlands found that factors like living alone and psychological distress were associated with loneliness across all ages. But there were other factors that seemed more related to loneliness at particular times in people’s lives: for instance, younger people showed the greatest association between contact with friends and loneliness, while older adults showed an association between health and loneliness. The work suggests interventions need to be tailored to age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do children think of adults? &lt;/strong&gt;A new paper explores the beliefs kids have about their caregivers’ own thoughts, behaviours, and failings. The project was unique, in that it was led and designed by the kids themselves. At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, (adult) co-authors &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/children-reveal-what-they-really-think-of-adults-in-their-own-research-paper-144025&quot;&gt;Emma Maynard and Sarah Barton explain the work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewing abstract art actually makes us think with a more abstract mindset&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/abstract-art-mindset-study&quot;&gt;reports Emma Betuel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers had participants view abstract or realistic paintings, then asked them to act as art critics deciding when and where to display the art. Abstract paintings tended to be displayed further away in both time and physical distance, demonstrating the way abstract art evokes “psychological distance”, making us think more conceptually and less in terms of concrete details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children who have experienced violence or trauma show signs of faster aging&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/03/children-who-suffer-violence-or-trauma-age-faster-study-finds&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. An analysis of dozens of studies found that these experiences tended to be related to earlier puberty in girls, as well as greater cellular aging and thinning of certain brain areas. However, the effects were small and more work is needed to understand the nature of the relationship, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, some pigeon psychology: scientists have found that attaching weights to the smaller birds results in them becoming more aggressive and rising up the social pecking order. &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers are not entirely sure why, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899438701/attaching-small-weights-to-pigeons-helps-them-shoot-up-in-the-social-hierarchy?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;report Ari Shapiro and Stacey Vanek Smith&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;: the weights may have helped the pigeons feel in “better shape”, or the birds may have ended up hunting food more aggressively, as they needed to consume more calories. Either way, it matters because scientists routinely attach tracking devices to birds which give them extra weight.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144901</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/&quot;&gt;Family Based Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;treatment approach of choice&lt;/a&gt; for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/&quot;&gt;negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/&quot;&gt;body neutral is the place to aim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by prostooleh via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/08/07/seventh-bmc-ecology-image-competition-the-winning-images/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Picture4-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh BMC Ecology Image Competition received a number of stunning collections of photographs from ecologists around the world,  demonstrating their talents in presenting their research, using photography to highlight their work. Anyone affiliated with a research institute was able to enter and we were amazed by both the quality and variety of submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, our &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; Section Editors lent their expertise to judge the many entrants to the competition, selecting the best images from their area of research as well as the overall winner. Our accompanying editorial gives more information about the winning images, the stories behind them and why they were picked. This also includes a selection of 7 highly commended images; there are some really great photos so please do take a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our winning images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall winner:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12056&quot; style=&quot;width: 582px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12056&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Sick-2-300x193.jpg&quot; width=&quot;572&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: David Costantini&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our overall winning image was taken by David Costantini from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Viruses are a significant ecological concern because they are responsible for a variety of pathological effects in wildlife. This photograph is of a magnificent frigatebird (&lt;em&gt;Fregata magnificens&lt;/em&gt;) chick, suffering from a viral infection from which, unfortunately,  it isn’t likely to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12057&quot; style=&quot;width: 592px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12057&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-green-lizard-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;582&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: S S Suresh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our runner up, in sharp contrast to our overall winner, is an image showcasing the vibrant colors of a forest green lizard (&lt;em&gt;Calotes calotes&lt;/em&gt;). Dr S S Suresh from the Ibri Regional Referral Hospital in Oman captured this stunning photograph after spotting a pair of the iguanian lizards in their breeding plumage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral and Physiological Ecology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12058&quot; style=&quot;width: 457px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12058&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/zombie-fungus-2-200x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;447&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Damien Esquerré&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our winner in this category, taken by Damien Esquerré from the Australian National University, is entitled “Zombie fungus” and with good reason. The unfortunate weevil shown has been infected by Cordyceps, a fungus that infects insects, controls their behavior and then kills them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community, population and macro-ecology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12059&quot; style=&quot;width: 555px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12059&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ghost-crab-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: HaoYun Zhuang&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delightful winning image was captured  by HaoYun Zhuang from Fuzhou University. This is a ghost crab, hiding in a human footprint on a beach in China. These animals are usually pale in color, blending into the sand, and can move very quickly to escape from predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation Ecology and Biodiversity Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12060&quot; style=&quot;width: 573px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12060&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-Pattern-2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Zu-Chang Xu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our winner in this category was an entry by Zu-Chang Xu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  It demonstrates a phenomenon called “crown shyness”, whereby the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, resulting in a canopy with channel-like gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: normal; background: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape Ecology and Ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kang Xu, who is  from the College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University  is our winner in this category, submitting a stunning image of a wind farm in China’s Gobi Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editors pick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12062&quot; style=&quot;width: 576px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12062&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/the-kings-bath-2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;566&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Attribution: Nayden Chakarov&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice as the Editor is entitled “The Kings Bath” and it was captured by Nayden Chakarov from Bielefeld University, Germany. It’s a cheerful photo of a duck having a wash.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How STEM Fields Can Foster A Sense Of Belonging For Minority And First-Gen Students</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fostering a positive identification with science is an important part of many programmes trying to make STEM more diverse. This is vital, as underrepresented groups may be faced with cultural stereotypes about science: that scientists are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/16/kids-are-more-motivated-to-do-science-than-be-a-scientist-a-finding-that-could-help-address-the-professions-diversity-problem/&quot;&gt;mainly White men&lt;/a&gt;, for example. These kinds of experiences can reinforce inequalities: &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/777458/Attitudes_towards_STEM_subjects_by_gender_at_KS4.pdf&quot;&gt;governmental research&lt;/a&gt; from 2019, for example, found that girls were far less likely to see themselves as good at science-related subjects, and enjoyed them less — despite outperforming their male peers at exams. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying as a ‘”science person” might also help other groups currently underrepresented in STEM. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220936480&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin &lt;/em&gt;suggests that a strong scientific identity can foster belonging and help first-generation and Black and minority ethnic university students feel more at home in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40021&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Susie Chen from the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues first looked at whether science identification was predictive of academic performance. On the night before an exam, 368 students enrolled in an Introductory Biology course were emailed a survey asking how much they agreed with statements including “I am a science person”. The team also looked at participants’ course grade and general academic history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results confirmed that those who identified more as a science person achieved higher grades. But the impact of science identification was greater for minority (Black and minority ethnic and first generation) students: the grade difference between students with a low and high science identification was larger in that group than among White, continuing-generation students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at whether science identification was related to better grades because it fostered students’ sense of belonging. At the start of the term, a teacher asked students in the Introductory Biology course to form groups of three to five people based on some similarity, such as living in the same halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the belonging condition then wrote for ten minutes about difficulties they were experiencing in the transition from school to university, and were given three quotes from other students addressing the same concerns and reminding participants that initial difficulties tend to be temporary and not an obstacle to belonging at university. Teams then discussed similarities and differences between their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the control condition, students took part in regular ice-breaking activities including drawing a mascot and choosing a biology-themed team name. Finally, science identification and belonging were both measured again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, science identification was more predictive of course outcomes for minority students than majority students. But the belonging manipulation had an effect too. Course outcomes for minority students in the social belonging condition were no longer dependent on science identification. This suggests that science ID does in fact invoke a sense of belonging that helps students perform well in class, and that other ways of fostering that sense of belonging can buffer against the negative effects of having a low science identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the intervention work? The authors suggest it’s because minority students may suffer from a lack of belonging due to stereotypes about what a scientist looks like: they might feel they don’t fit that profile. For example, previous research has found that minority groups are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt;more likely to experience imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — and that that can have a negative impact on levels of achievement, engagement, attendance and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many reasons minority students might not feel like they belong, including institutional racism or other discrimination, so looking more closely at &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; students don’t feel they fit in or identify with their chosen topic could be helpful in developing more robust solutions. Future research could also look at intersectionality — how different backgrounds or identities work together to influence sense of belonging, science identification or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220936480&quot;&gt;Am I a Science Person? A Strong Science Identity Bolsters Minority Students’ Sense of Belonging and Performance in College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Factors associated with perceived loneliness across the adult life span</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12046</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/08/06/factors-associated-with-perceived-loneliness-across-the-adult-life-span/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/person-409127_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness across life phases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to deal with loneliness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Leveraging Machine Learning to Fuel New Discoveries with the arXiv Dataset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=658</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly 30 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; has served the public and research communities by providing open access to scholarly articles, from the vast branches of physics to the many subdisciplines of computer science to everything in between, including math, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of arXiv research papers is both beneficial and challenging. Whether it’s a graduate student ramping up in her respective field, an established professor delving into adjacent ones, or researchers searching for big picture insights for the public good, this rich corpus of information offers significant, but sometimes overwhelming, depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make the arXiv more accessible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv&quot;&gt;we present a free, open pipeline on Kaggle to the machine-readable arXiv dataset: a repository of 1.7 million articles&lt;/a&gt;, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having the entire arXiv corpus on Kaggle grows the potential of arXiv articles immensely,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “By offering the dataset on Kaggle we go beyond what humans can learn by reading all these articles and we make the data and information behind arXiv available to the public in a machine-readable format.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaggle is a destination for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking interesting datasets, public notebooks, and competitions. Researchers can utilize Kaggle’s extensive data exploration tools and easily share their relevant scripts and output with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv is more than a repository of articles, it’s a platform for knowledge sharing,” said Presani. “This requires constant innovation on how we present and interpret the knowledge we make available. Kaggle users can help push the limits of this innovation and it can be a new outlet for our community to collaborate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With large data sets, there is generally an expectation that there are likely to be overlooked discoveries, connections, innovative tools or perspectives, which may lead to additional insights, not just in the original subject, but across other fields of study, enabling yet more discovery and innovation,” said Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Call to Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to empower new use cases that can lead to the exploration of richer machine learning techniques that combine multi-modal features towards applications like trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, co-citation networks, knowledge graph construction, and semantic search interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of such a semantic search application built on top of a specific corpus would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/an-nlu-powered-tool-to-explore-covid-19.html&quot;&gt;Google’s COVID-19 Research Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that helps researchers pore through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge&quot;&gt;CORD-19 dataset&lt;/a&gt; – a repository of 190,000+ science articles on COVID-19. Interfaces built on datasets such as this leverage advanced NLU techniques to understand a user’s &lt;i&gt;intent&lt;/i&gt; behind a query. Ultimately, this can enable more efficient research by surfacing relevant data and evidence to complex, scientific questions. We hope the release of the machine-readable arXiv dataset will inspire the creation of similar NLU tools over this new corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Alemi, Senior Research Scientist at Google, has also pursued more exciting applications of ML using the arXiv. As described in the paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00075.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Use of arXiv as a Dataset&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , Alex and his colleagues sought to propel the arXiv as a benchmark for large scale, multi-relational tasks, such as with graph neural networks.  “I’m excited to see the research community rise to the challenge of a rich, multifaceted dataset with so much real-world practicality, and the new questions this will raise,” says Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv&quot;&gt;The dataset is now available on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; and will be updated weekly. Please send us your feedback and stay tuned for additional updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Paul Ginsparg, the noted physicist and visionary behind the arXiv, and Jack Hidary of X, The Moonshot Factory, who worked to bring this collaboration to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dataset would not be possible without the helpful input of many people. Much appreciation to (in alphabetical order of last name): Alex Alemi, Timo Bozsolik, Alison Fromme, Peijen Lin, Brian Maltzan, Eleonora Presani, Steinn Sigurdsson and Joe Tricot.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Nine titles on the frontiers of psychology research [reading list]</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144863</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632719274/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is the responsibility of psychologists to their clients and their communities during times of crisis? Annually, the American Psychological Association meets to present the research and best practices to meet the needs of the profession and the broader world.  These nine new titles present the latest, most advanced research to create a bridge between the academy and practitioners as we work to address racism and hate, face the psychological toll of COVID-19, and strive for sustainable leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-tough-standard-9780190075873&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tough Standard: The Hard Truths About Masculinity and Violence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Ronald F. Levant and Shana Pryor &lt;/strong&gt;Written by past president of American Psychological Association, this book &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;ynthesizes over four decades of research in the psychology of men and the role of masculine norms in the present moment in American including the Me Too movement, March for Our Lives, and Black Lives Matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-9780190056742&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legacy of Racism for Children: Psychology, Law, and Public Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;edited by Margaret C. Stevenson, Bette L. Bottoms, and Kelly C. Burke &lt;/strong&gt;This volume is the first book to examine issues that arise when minority children’s lives are influenced by laws and policies that are rooted in historical racism. It addresses intersections of race/ethnicity within the context of child maltreatment, custody and interracial adoption, familial incarceration, school punishment and the school-to-prison pipeline, juvenile justice, police/youth interactions, jurors’ perceptions of child and adolescent victims and defendants, and immigration law and policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-science-of-diversity-9780190686345&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Science of Diversity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Mona Sue Weissmark &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESmIEa-jJrY-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This book uses a multidisciplinary approach to excavate the&lt;br /&gt;theories, principles, and paradigms that illuminate our understanding of the issues surrounding human diversity, social equality, and justice. Showing why diversity programs fail, the book provides tools to understand how biases develop and influence our relationships and interactions with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dont-wait-and-see-9780190081300&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Wait and See!: A Neuropsychologist’s Guide to Helping Children Who are Developing Differently&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;by Emily Papazoglou  &lt;/strong&gt;Written by an expert in child development, this first of its kind book will help families take quick action to identify and address areas of concern during early childhood, a time of critical brain development. Full of practical advice on how to address developmental issues, this book aims to lower stress and build hope as families learn how to maximize their child’s potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ptsd-9780190930363&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PTSD: What Everyone Needs to Know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Barbara O. Rotbaum and Sheila A.M. Rauch &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EU1mFW4lQsk-147x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;147&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Using a reader-friendly question and answer format, the book demystifies and defines posttraumatic stress disorder, describes its effects, reveals how treatment works, and explains why everyone should know more about the role traumatic experiences play in our lives and in culture and society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-blind-storyteller-9780190061920&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blind Storyteller: How We Reason About Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Iris Berent &lt;/strong&gt;An intellectual journey that draws on philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, cognitive science, and the author’s own research, this book&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;examines the gulf that exists between our intuitive understanding of human nature and the reality evidenced by science. The book grapples with a host of provocative questions, from why we are so afraid of zombies, to whether dyslexia is just in our heads, from what happens to us when we die, to why we are so infatuated with our brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/innumeracy-in-the-wild-9780190861094&quot;&gt;Innumeracy in the Wild: Misunderstanding and Misusing Numbers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Ellen Peters &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EY-FC0t9ABw-146x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This book&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;presents the logic, rules, and habits that highly numerate people use in decision making. This text offers a state-of-the-art review of the now sizeable body of psychological and applied findings that demonstrate the critical importance of numeracy in our world. With more than two decades of experience in the decision sciences, Ellen Peters demonstrates how intervention can foster adult numeric capacity, propel people to use numeric facts in decision making, and empower people with lower numeracy to reason better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/leading-with-feeling-9780190698942&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading with Feeling: Nine Strategies of Emotionally Intelligent Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Cary Cherniss &lt;/strong&gt;This book describes how 25 outstanding leaders used emotional intelligence to deal with critical challenges and opportunities. Featuring commentary from the leaders themselves, the book distills their experiences into nine strategies that can help anyone be more effective at work. Each chapter features activities designed to help readers apply the strategies to their own working lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reset-9780197532638&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reset: An Introduction to Behavior&lt;/em&gt; Centered Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Robert Aunger&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EY-FC1H9uig-146x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;This book presents Behavior Centered Design, a new framework for how to change behavior and implement processes for developing change programs. Drawing on cutting-edge research in evolutionary biology, ecological psychology, and neuroscience, this  approach encourages practitioners to think differently about behavior – both in understanding how and why it is produced, and in how to design programs to change it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These books—from leaders in academia and in the practice field—continue the critical dialog of how the field of psychology can respond proactively and adaptively to the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@sylviasyang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Sylvia Yang&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/books?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/nine-titles-on-the-frontiers-of-psychology-research-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Nine titles on the frontiers of psychology research [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632719274/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632719274/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2fESmIEa-jJrY-145x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632719274/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/nine-titles-for-psychologists-in-a-time-of-crisis-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nine titles for psychologists in a time of crisis [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-communities-can-help-stop-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How communities can help stop COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>I’ve been using deep neural networks (DNNs) in my research. DNNs, as is often preached, are powerful models, capable of mapping almost any function. However, after the sermon is over, someone starting to train a DNN in the wild can … &lt;a href=&quot;https://pillowlab.wordpress.com/2020/08/04/step-by-step-procedure-for-choosing-a-learning-rate-and-other-optimization-hyperparameters/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;meta-nav&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Sexual minority middle-aged and older adults are at high risk for having multiple chronic diseases</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/08/04/sexual-minority-middle-aged-and-older-adults-are-at-high-risk-for-having-multiple-chronic-diseases/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/lgbt-4115612_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases, which include diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and arthritis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04188.x&quot;&gt;More than half&lt;/a&gt; of older adults in the US have &lt;em&gt;three or more&lt;/em&gt; chronic diseases. Having multiple chronic diseases can increase the chances for disability, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults are an under-served population that experience health disparities often related to a lifetime of stressors such as stigma, discrimination, and oppression. As such, this is a population with many barriers to receiving patient-centered health care. With aging, middle-aged and older LGB adults are therefore likely to be at risk not only for medical diseases, but also other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine chronic diseases in this population, we used data from the US &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm&quot;&gt;National Survey of Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt; to determine the extent of three chronic conditions: mental illness, unhealthy substance use, and having two or more medical diseases. We then looked at the presence of having more than one of these conditions among LGB adults age 50 and older. We found that gay men and bisexual women in particular, were at high risk for having two or more conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the complex health needs of this population. It is important to recognize that while medical and public health interventions usually focus on one condition, this is often not appropriate for older adults with multiple chronic diseases. A patient-centered coordinated approach is needed that considers how each condition is interrelated with other coexisting diseases. Unhealthy substance use and mental illness for example can complicate the management of chronic medical diseases and lead to poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The care of older adults, especially for communities that are under-served, such as sexual minority populations, needs to involve patient-centered care that considers all chronic diseases and how they may be related. For older LGB adults we also need a greater awareness of all possible forms of stigma related to people such as older individuals and those of sexual minority status, and we must understand how this may impact health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of our research is to not further stigmatize but to draw attention to the needs of older adults from communities who have been neglected and under-served so that they can receive better care through improved awareness of the multiple factors that affect health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Antibiotic prescribing in England, and how this relates to the local area</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12070</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/08/03/antibiotic-prescribing-in-england-and-how-this-relates-to-the-local-area/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/cure-1006810_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s, there have been over 150 antibacterial drugs developed and marketed for human or veterinary use. The effect these drugs have had on infectious diseases and population health is remarkable. A once considered serious bacterial infection can now be successfully managed using antibiotics prescribed from the doctor. This was not always the case, as our grandparents may testify: bacterial infections were often fatal and the choices available to manage such infections were limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “golden age” of discovery may, however, soon come to an end, as more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to the antibiotics available to us. It is for this reason that healthcare organizations across the world have been focusing on developing stewardship policies to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics. In England, the situation is no different, and the Department of Health and Social Care have developed an antimicrobial resistance strategy. As part of the plan, doctors have been urged to reduce the amount of antibiotics they prescribe when it is safe and appropriate to do so. As the majority of antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, healthcare providers working in this setting are set specific prescribing targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to establish if the polices are working from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, but also that these polices are fair, and do not penalize communities in the most need of care. Our work aimed to address these questions. To do this, we used antibiotic prescribing data from the NHS, as well as working out the characteristics of the local areas in England using nationally available data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we found that, in England, the plan to reduce antibiotic prescribing appears to be working: since 2014, antibiotic prescribing has reduced by around 14 per cent.  We also found that prescribing of certain classes of antibiotics, namely those considered broad spectrum, have also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we considered local factors in our analysis, we showed that the most deprived areas of England had the highest levels of antibiotic prescribing.  When we adjusted for two long-term conditions – diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – both of which are associated with increased antibiotic use, we still found higher levels of antibiotic prescribing in the most deprived areas of England.  We also showed that geography was an important factor too: compared to London, all other areas of England had higher levels of antibiotic prescribing – with the East of England, and the North East of England having the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering local needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask why this is important? Well, that’s a good question.  Our work shows that in addition to a national strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing, it is important to consider local needs too. People living in more deprived areas might, for example, might have greater health need for antibiotics compared to people living in more affluent areas.  National one-sized-fits all targets might not necessarily account for this. If there is greater antibiotic need in deprived areas, doctors working in these areas might be unfairly penalized for prescribing them.  This is not fair on the doctors working in primary care, but may also impact on patients too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic stewardship polices appear to be reducing overall antibiotic prescribing, which is a positive thing, although there is still significant variation in prescribing across England.  It would be appropriate for future prescribing targets to account for local factors to ensure the most deprived communities are not inappropriately penalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is if someone is in medical need of an antibiotic, they should be prescribed it, regardless of the characteristics of their local area or where they live.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bits of DNA: $ How to profit from COVID-19 testing $</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/?p=14465</guid>
	<link>https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid testing has been a powerful tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks around the world (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.iospress.com/articles/clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch209004&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, …). While many countries support testing through government sponsored healthcare infrastructure, in the United States COVID-19 testing has largely been organized and provided by for-profit businesses. While financial incentives coupled with social commitment have motivated many scientists and engineers at companies and universities to work hard around the clock to facilitate testing, there are also many individuals who have succumbed to greed. Opportunism has bubbled to the surface and scams, swindles, rackets, misdirection and fraud abound. This is happening at a time when workplaces are in desperate need of testing, and demands for testing are likely to increase as schools, colleges and universities start opening up in the next month. Here are some examples of what is going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost there is your basic fraud. In July, a company called “Fillakit”, which had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus-contracts/contracts/70FB7020D00000029&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awarded a $10.5 million federal contract&lt;/a&gt; to make COVID-19 test kits, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-ordered-10-2-million-in-covid-19-testing-kits-its-now-warning-states-not-to-use&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shipping unusable, contaminated, soda bottles&lt;/a&gt;. This “business”, started by some law and real estate guy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://kiowacountypress.net/content/closer-look-federal-covid-contractors-reveals-inexperience-fraud-accusations-and-weapons&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Wexler, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-test-kit-maker-dissolves-amid-probes-11594153304&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went under two months after it launched&lt;/a&gt; amidst a slew of investigations and complaints from former workers. Oh, BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87789&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michigan ordered 322,000 Fillakit tubes&lt;/a&gt; which went straight to the trash (as a result they could not do a week worth of tests).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all fraud is large scale. Some former VP at now defunct “Cure Cannabis Solutions” ordered 100 COVID-19 test kits that do who-knows-what at a price of 50c a kit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/feds-seize-100-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits-shipped-from-china-addressed-to-portland-man-with-prior-ties-to-cannabis-industry.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Feds seized it&lt;/a&gt;. These kits, which were not FDA approved, were sourced from “Anhui DeepBlue Medical” in Hefei, China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be fair, the Cannabis guy was small fry. In Laredo Texas, some guy called Robert Castañeda received assistance from a &lt;em&gt;congressman&lt;/em&gt; to purchase $500,000 of kits from the same place! Anhui DeepBlue Medical sent Castańeda 20,000 kits ($25 a test). Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/he-spent--500-000-to-buy-coronavirus-tests-health-officials-say-theyre-unreliable&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the tests had 20% accuracy.&lt;/a&gt; To his credit, the Cannabis guy paid 1/50th the price for this junk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s not forget who is really raking in the bucks though. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the primary testing outfits in the US right now; each is processing around 150,000 tests a day. These are for-profit companies and indeed they are making a profit. The economics is simple: insurance companies reimburse LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics for the tests. The rates are basically determined by the amount that Medicare will pay, i.e. the government price point. Intiially, the reimbursement was set at $51, and well… at that price LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/30/coronavirus-testing-stunted-low-medicare-reimbursement/3048943001/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weren’t that interested&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, people have to put food on the table, right? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=205179230701958&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adam Schechter&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of LabCorp makes $4.9 million a year; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=241018100270891&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steve Rusckowski&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Quest Diagnostics, makes $9.9 million a year). So the Medicare reimbursement rate was raised to $100. The thing is, LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics get paid regardless of how long it takes to return test results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7.com/coronavirus-los-angeles-california-testing-long-wait-for-covid-19/6341394/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some people are currently waiting 15 days to get results&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: such tests results are useless).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps a silver lining lies in the stock price of these companies. The title of this post is “$ How to Profit From COVID-19 Testing $”. I guess being able to take a week or two to return a test result and still get paid $100 for something that cost $30 lifts the stock price… and you can profit!&lt;img alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-14474 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14474&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.03.23 AM&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2496,1326&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-03-23-am/&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.03.23-am.png?w=490&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s not forget the tech bros! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A bunch of dudes in Utah from companies like Nomi, Domo and Qualtrics signed a two-month contract with the state of Utah to provide 3,000 tests a day&lt;/a&gt;. One of the tech executives pushing the initiative, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.testutah.com/en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TestUtah&lt;/a&gt;, was a 37-year old founder (of Nomi Health) by the name of Mark Newman. He admitted that “none of us knew anything about lab testing at the start of the effort”. Didn’t stop Newman et al. from signing more than $50 million in agreements with several states to provide testing. tl;dr: the tests had a poor limit of detection, samples were mishandled, throughput was much lower than promised etc. etc. and as a result they weren’t finding positive cases at rates similar to other testing facilities. The significance is summarized poignantly in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-utahs-tech-industry-tried-to-disrupt-coronavirus-testing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New Yorker piece about the debacle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I might be sick, but I want to go see my grandma, who’s ninety-five. So I go to a TestUtah site, and I get tested. TestUtah tells me I’m negative. I go see grandma, and she gets sick from me because my result was wrong, because TestUtah ran an unvalidated test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. There has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/utah-adds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a disturbing TestUtah hydroxycholorquine story going on behind the scenes&lt;/a&gt;. I include this fact because no post on fraud and COVID-19 would be complete without a mention of hydroxycholoroquine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe though, the tech bros will save the day. The recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://xprize.org/prizes/covidtesting&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$5 million COVID-19 X-prize&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to incentivize the development of “Frequent. Fast. Cheap. Easy.” COVID-19 testing. The goal is nothing less than to “radically change the world.” I’m hopeful, but I just hope they don’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/10-million-genomics-x-prize-canceled-outpaced-innovation-8C10990757&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cancel it like they did the genome prize&lt;/a&gt;. After all, their goal of “500 tests per week with 12 hour turnaround from sample to result” is likely to be outpaced by innovation just like what happened with genome sequencing. So in terms of making money from COVID-19 testing don’t hold your breath with this prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is evident from the examples above, one of the obstacles to quick riches with COVID-19 testing in the USA is the FDA. The thing about COVID-19 testing is that lying to the FDA on applications, or providing unauthorized tests, can lead to unpleasantries, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt;. So some play it straight and narrow. Consider, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SeqOnce&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/azureseq/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Azureseq SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit&lt;/a&gt;. These guys have an “EUA-FDA validated test”: &lt;img alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-14476&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14476&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-07-31 at 2.14.45 AM&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2336,2130&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-profit-from-covid-19-testing/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2-14-45-am/&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-31-at-2.14.45-am.png?w=490&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is exactly what you want! You can click on “Order Now” and pay $3,000 for a kit that can be used to test several hundred samples (great price!) and the site has all the necessary information: IFUs (these are “instructions for use” that come with FDA authorized tests), validation results etc. If you look carefully you’ll see that administration of the test requires FDA approval. The company is upfront about this. Except the test is not FDA authorized; this is easy to confirm by examining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the FDA Coronavirus EUA site&lt;/a&gt;. One can infer from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seqonce.com/seqonce-biosciences-launches-azureseq-one-step-universal-sars-cov-2-rt-qpcr-kit/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that they have &lt;em&gt;submitted&lt;/em&gt; an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) but while they claim it has been &lt;em&gt;validated&lt;/em&gt;, nowhere does it say it has been &lt;em&gt;authorized.&lt;/em&gt;Clever eh? &lt;em&gt;Authorized,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;validated, authorized, validated, authorized, .. &lt;/em&gt;and here I was just about to spend $3,000 for a bunch of tests that cannot be currently legally administered. &lt;strong&gt;Whew&lt;/strong&gt;!At least this is not fraud. Maybe it’s better called… I don’t know… a game? Other companies are playing similar games. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concentricbyginkgo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gingko Bioworks is advertising “testing at scale, supporting schools and businesses” with an “Easy to use FDA-authorized test”&lt;/a&gt; but again this seems to be a product that has “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-06-19/ginkgo-bioworks-ceo-on-new-covid-19-testing-initiative-video&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;“, not one that, you know, actually exists; I could find no Gingko Bioworks test that works at scale that is authorized on the FDA Coronavirus EUA website, and it turns out that what they mean by FDA authorized is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jrkelly/status/1273704377665101838?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an RT-PCR test that they have outsourced to others&lt;/a&gt;.  Fingers crossed though- maybe the marketing helped CEO Jason Kelly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/28/business/ginkgo-raises-70-million-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-employers-universities/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raise the $70 million&lt;/a&gt; his company has received for the effort; I certainly hope it works (soon)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, I mentioned that the SeqOnce operation is a bunch of “guys”. I meant this literally; this is their “team”:&lt;br /&gt;

Just one sec… &lt;strong&gt;what is up with biotech startups and 100% men leadership teams? &lt;/strong&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epinomics.co/team-bios&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Epinomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insightgenetics.com/about/management-team&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Insight Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceangenomics.com/team/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocean Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kailosgenetics.com/our-team&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kailos Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://circulogene.com/leadership-team/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Circulogene&lt;/a&gt;, etc. etc.)… And what’s up with the black and white thing? Is that to try to hide that there are no people of color?&lt;br /&gt;
I mention the 100% male team because if you look at all the people mentioned in this post, all of them are guys (except the person in the next sentence), and I didn’t plan that, it just how it worked out. Look, I’m not casting shade on the former CEO of Theranos. I’m just saying that there is a strong correlation here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, back to the regular programming…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of swindlers and scammers, this post would not be complete without a mention of the COVID-19 testing czar, Jared Kushner. His secret testing plan for the United States went “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;poof into thin air&lt;/a&gt;“! I felt that the 1 million contaminated and unusable Chinese test kits that he ordered for &lt;em&gt;$52 million&lt;/em&gt; deserved the final mention in this post. Sadly, these failed kits appear to be the main thrust of the federal response to COVID-19 testing needs so far, and consistent with Trump’s recent call to, “slow the testing down” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/donald-trump-testing-slow-down-response/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he wasn’t kidding&lt;/a&gt;). Let’s see what turns up today at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110912?s=1&amp;amp;r=50&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hearings of the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, whose agenda is “The Urgent Need for a National Plan to Contain the Coronavirus”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

When first introduced, the attraction of the Big Deal was immediately obvious, since it allows a library to buy its faculty access to most, if not all, of a publisher’s journals at a much lower “cost per article” (discounted) rate. From the start, however, there were doubters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1024/ShannonPritting.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;683&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SQq3Yrs6Dvw/XyKcsrJBXfI/AAAAAAAAq6k/G4_Q9KLe-SwD1cURP6VLy-7am7li4aduQCNcBGAsYHQ/w256-h170/ShannonPritting.jpg&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Shannon Pritting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2001, the Director of Libraries at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Kenneth Frazier, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/frazier/03frazier.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the library community of the dangers of signing big deals, or any comprehensive licensing agreement, with commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The current generation of library directors is engaged in a dangerous ‘game’ in which short-term institutional benefits are achieved at the long-term expense of the academic community,” he warned, adding that big deals would weaken libraries’ ability to manage their journal collections, foist on them journals they “neither need nor want” and increase their dependence on publishers “who have already shown their determination to monopolize the information marketplace.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, many libraries did sign big deals. And many later regretted it, not least because, having done so, they felt they had no choice but to keep renewing the contract, even as the cost kept going up and devoured more and more of their budget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libraries felt trapped, conscious that if they did not renew they would have to go back to subscribing to individual journals at list price, which would mean being able to afford access to fewer journals, and fearful that when they discovered that journals they wanted were no longer available, faculty would revolt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over time, however, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/05/01/wolf-finally-arrives-big-deal-cancelations-north-american-libraries/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;greater willingness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to think the unthinkable emerged, and some libraries began to cancel their big deals. And when they did so the sky did not fall in – which allowed other libraries to take heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The list maintained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that libraries began cancelling their big deals as long ago as 2008, but the number doing so has been accelerating in the last few years. What has really focussed minds are the recent decisions by both the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;University of California&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611#.XuJLLWKW_k0.twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to walk away from their negotiations with Elsevier rather than renew their big deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is not necessary to walk away completely in the way UC and MIT have done. Instead, libraries can “unbundle” their Big Deal by replacing the large package of several thousand journals they are subscribed to with a small à la carte bundle of a few hundred journals, and in the process save themselves a great deal of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is helping libraries to make the decision to unbundle is the knowledge that more and more research is becoming available on an open access basis. In addition, new tools like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsub.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Unsub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; are available to advise them on which journals they can cancel without too great an impact, and which journals are essential and so should be retained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the big savings that can be realised, and the pressure library budgets are under, unbundling is expected to grow, particularly in light of the straitened circumstances that libraries will find themselves in after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year a number of US universities have unbundled in favour of smaller packages of journals, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.unc.edu/2020/04/upcoming-elsevier-cancellations/&quot;&gt;UNC Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.lib.iastate.edu/elsevier&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; and the State University of New York (&lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://slcny.libguides.com/slc/elsevier2020update&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;SUNY&lt;/a&gt;) -- a system of 64 institutions. Coming in the wake of UC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; decision to walk away from Elsevier these &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;little deals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; have attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Europe, by contrast, there is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/&quot;&gt;greater focus&lt;/a&gt; right no on signing &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing reading rights, these new-style big deals include prepaid publishing rights to allow faculty to publish their articles on an open access basis. Amongst other things, these deals help assuage concerns about &lt;a data-original-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;data-original-href&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default&quot;&gt;double dipping&lt;/a&gt; (where a university may end up paying both article-processing charges and subscriptions for the same journals). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;So how is a decision to unbundle made, and what are the issues and implications of making the decision? To get a clearer picture I spoke recently by email with Shannon Pritting, Shared Library Services Platform Project Director at SUNY. In April, SUNY replaced its Big Deal of 2,200 journals with Elsevier with a “little deal” of just 248 journals. By doing so, it says, it has saved about $7 million.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unbundling raises a lot of questions, and I suspect we may not have answers to all of the questions for some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, as more and more universities unbundle, how accurate will the calculations informing the decisions about which journals to give up and which to keep prove to be over time? This could have implications for, amongst other things, how much of the money that has been saved will need to be spent on obtaining paywalled articles through Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and document delivery services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, since unbundling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brXHnANwLBCHYo5b79hF6vGF63fdOCSOSiPxCScf0hc/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; currently to be mainly a US thing (with Europe favouring transformative agreements) might we see a geographical divide emerge? If we do, what might the implications of this be, especially for the open access movement?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, might unbundling encourage more researchers to use illegal services like Sci-Hub, and might unbundling see university libraries marginalised to some extent, especially if they do not play an active role in funding open access?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please read on for the interview. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY consists of 64 campuses I believe.

Over the five-year period from 2015-2019, SUNY authors published on average 1,361 gold open access articles and 565 hybrid open access articles per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No SUNY libraries currently pay for OA fees. These costs are paid directly by the author or the department, and payment data is not centrally managed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We expect that OA fees paid by SUNY authors will remain relatively stable, as most agencies who provide grant funding have already implemented OA requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY does not therefore know how much is spent on APCs each year by SUNY faculty?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, SUNY does not have a reliable estimate of how much is spent on APCs by SUNY faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is there a SUNY-wide OA policy, or does each campus have its own separate policy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; There is a system wide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;open access policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, approved by the SUNY Board of Trustees in March 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This policy requires that the Universities (but not community colleges) should develop and adopt open access policies for each institution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The community colleges are encouraged, but not required, to adopt open access policies. Of the 30 universities, 21 currently have open access policies, with all 30 expected to have policies by December 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three community colleges have open access policies, with the expectation that only a few more will develop open access policies. We have collected institutional open access policies into a repository that you can view &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/handle/1951/71081&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the most part, SUNY institutional OA policies leave the decision of whether to publish open access or deposit works into repositories with the faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A major focus of SUNY in open access has been through Open Educational Resources (OER), which has led to major improvements in college affordability, and improvements in teaching and learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investment in OER came from NY State Government, with $12 million invested in OER over three years, that has resulted in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suny.edu/suny-news/press-releases/02-20/2-4-20/2-4-20-oer-savings.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;nearly $50 million in savings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and improved teaching and learning outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Unbundling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: SUNY recently unbundled its Big Deal with Elsevier, reducing the number of journals it subscribes to from 2,200 to 248. As I understand it from a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/tool-saving-universities-millions-dollars-journal-subscriptions&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, SUNY used Unsub to help it decide which journals to give up, and this estimated that a modest number of subscriptions would be enough to supplement the large numbers of Elsevier papers already available outside of paywalls. Of the papers SUNY researchers can access under the new arrangement, the calculation was that 30% of the papers that faculty are likely to need access to are available open access and, thanks to a post-termination agreement (PTA) with Elsevier, 25% will remain freely available to faculty from Elsevier. This does not imply that 45% will need to be ordered via document delivery services right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY partnered with Unsub (at the time Unpaywall Journals) to model costs and access options if we decided to cancel or unbundle our Elsevier Big Deal. The percentage you mention of 45% of content not being immediately accessible isn’t something that the Unsub data generally provided as a data point. Although the Unsub data varied by journal, the percentage that wouldn’t be immediately accessible was typically below 20%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although there was a lot of scepticism about the reliability of Unsub data and modelling in predicting costs post-cancellation, the tool and services helped us to think critically about all other data we were using to determine value. In the end, most SUNYs found that Unsub data was useful, and as reliable as other sources that we were using to determine the value of a big deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, Post-Termination Access helps with providing immediate access. However, I don’t think that any campus expects that either 45% or 20% of the usage would translate into document delivery purchases. Everyone understands that journal usage data is inflated, flawed, and doesn’t reflect true usage and value. Yet, most forecasts of costs after cancellation or unbundling are based on vendor provided usage data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing the Big Deal to a smaller, focused package. And, if libraries find that users are requesting via ILL or document delivery a high amount of articles from any specific journal, they can always subscribe to a single journal if it’s cost effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, the strategy was that the big deal provides access to a lot of content, but our big deal wasn’t an effective use of our money; it was worth it to see what actually happens after we changed our subscription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, I expect that we’ll see the same trends and results that other consortia and libraries have seen: a cancellation of a big deal doesn’t lead to resulting increased costs for article purchasing or ILL that is anywhere near what a subscription to that large set of journals costs. Most users will find alternative sources as the user usually doesn’t need a specific article, but just needs an article that is relevant to the topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, SUNY’s decision was based on the simple equation of whether 2,200 journals was worth the amount we were paying for the Big Deal, and not the fear of what the costs would be for guaranteeing the same type of access to the 2,200 journals as we had when we subscribed to the bundle.  Just as important as determining whether we could provide access to papers we would lose from the bundled titles was determining how many of these 2,200 journals we needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This work took just as much time or more than cost modelling. It involved outreach by many librarians with faculty and administration across SUNY. SUNY also hosted several coordinated open forums with faculty about the Elsevier deal, and engaged with Faculty governance and administration at the system and campus levels. Certainly usage data informed the journals we targeted for the 248, but equally important was input from our user community that was led by librarians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We certainly had to walk through various data-driven scenarios of costs after cancellation, value of the package based on usage (and what journals were most important) to ensure we were gathering input and managing the change that comes from moving away from a Big Deal. But, the decision for SUNY was based on whether we valued the journals enough to pay the amount the vendor required us to pay to maintain that access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, it wasn’t in the best interests of SUNY to continue with the Big Deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Individual title subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As you indicate, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Elsevier unbundled deal assumes that any campus or department that needs access to journals not in the smaller bundle can subscribe separately. Do you have any sense of how many such subscriptions might be taken out/have been taken out? Presumably, they would need to be funded with money outside the library budget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The expectation is that campuses who want to subscribe to journals outside of the 248 titles that most of SUNY gets is that the library subscribes to the journal separately at list price. This funding would be coming from the individual library budget, and would be funded with savings from the difference between what the library would have contributed to the previous big deal and the smaller 248 title deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There have been very few individual title subscriptions for Elsevier titles that were lost in the change to the smaller unbundled deal. The global pandemic began to impact the US just after the new unbundled deal was finalized, which resulted in libraries immediately beginning to limit spending, and then begin to cut budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The savings from the change from the Big Deal to an unbundled deal provided campuses with the ability to weather drastic cuts, and many used the savings to help meet the need to quickly cut spending and budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Presumably the figure of 25% of articles that will be freely available as a result of the PTA with Elsevier will grow over time, in line with the number of new papers published in Elsevier journals that are not covered by the PTA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;There will be some growth in the percentage of content that our users may want, but don’t have immediate access to as our Post Termination access grows less current. However, the percent increase and the costs of access will not be enough of a percentage to come close to the difference in what our previous deal cost our institutions, and what our current subscription will cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY would prefer to look at the aggregate savings built by the years it will take for our PTA to age as a major advantage to unbundling. In essence, as the industry shifts and more consortia and large libraries break subscriptions, the market for journal access will only be more advantageous to the subscriber in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thinking of growth over time in the amount of content that our users can’t access via PTA, or a subscription, assumes that the value of a subscription or journal package will only grow. It’s clear that the value of big deals is declining, so future deals should only be more advantageous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If SUNY does find it more cost effective to enter into another big deal or “re-bundle” what it recently unbundled, future deals should be better than the deal we had, which was based on historical metrics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Of those papers that will be available open access how many do you estimate will be the Version of Record (VoR) and how many are likely to be self-archived versions – e.g. preprint, Authors Accepted Manuscript (AAM), or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/research/open-access/open-access-and-the-ref/understanding-versions-of-your-paper/%5d&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;some other version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that is not the VoR? Does the version matter?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a tough question to answer, but based on experience searching for content and assisting users, I’d say that about half of the access would be content that is other than the Version of Record. In most cases, the Version of Record is not needed. But, when it is needed, this is where document delivery purchasing would be used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;ILL and document delivery services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: So, SUNY uses both ILL and document delivery services for obtaining articles in journals it does not subscribe to. Can you say which services are used and how many documents on average are ordered each year via a) ILL and b) document delivery services? How do you expect those figures to change going forward?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our primary vendor for document delivery is Reprints Desk. A few institutions also use Copyright Clearance Center’s “Get it Now” service, but this is only for a small percentage of the document delivery volume. SUNY Libraries use the lowest cost vendor for document delivery, and for all but a few percent of articles, Reprints Desk is the lowest cost option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on 5 years of ILL data (2015-19) SUNY has 300,000 total ILL requests per year (both lending and borrowing) for books and articles. Considering that half of ILL requests are for articles, and half of the requests are lending, about 100,000 requests are for ILL articles per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over this five-year span, total ILL volume has decreased a few percent per year. I expect that the total volume of ILL will continue to decrease, especially for articles. Every consortium that has cancelled big deals has found that there has been little impact on overall ILL volume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 100,000 articles requested in SUNY each year, about 25% are for content published within the last five years, which has the potential to incur costs for access. ILL departments are already doing a fine job providing access to current content as a supplement or alternative to subscriptions, and will be a reliable source to provide access for any content that is needed but not available via subscription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY libraries have regularly found that providing access to journals via ILL and document delivery is more cost effective than subscribing to journals that have high subscription costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY doesn’t currently have data on how many document delivery purchases are made per year, but we are working with our primary document delivery provider to gather this data to use as another point of consideration when we consider access options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Do you have any sense of how much SUNY libraries generally pay for document delivery and ILL services each year?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount that SUNY pays for document delivery and ILL services each year varies between institutions. Typically, smaller institutions don’t pay for document delivery, with our largest few institutions paying from $50,000 to $100,000. But we don’t currently have reliable detailed data on this document delivery spending in aggregate across our 60 institutions as each campus pays separately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although our campuses will continue to decrease the amount of content such as journals that they license, we expect to see only a slight increase in document delivery costs. Users typically find alternative paths to journal articles if libraries don’t subscribe, whether it’s open access or alternative versions of a paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Document delivery is used only in limited circumstances, and we expect the percentage of articles that are available without a subscription to continue to increase. Most of the SUNYs also have enabled Unpaywall integration in their link resolvers, so open access is provided as an option whenever possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand it costs between $35 and $40 per article to order via Reprints Desk. In addition, there will be costs for ILL. An &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;amp;context=library_facpubs&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; from 2015 estimates the cost of ILL at between $8-$10 per item. Does that sound about right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have reasonably reliable data about the number of transactions where campuses have paid copyright (which in this case includes purchasing the article from a document delivery provider) and the number is 16,250 per year. Your estimate of $35-$40 per article is fair, so our document delivery and copyright spending would be roughly $568,750 dollars per year. However, some of the heaviest requested publications such as Nature, and even Elsevier publications, cost less than $25 per article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We think that there is a fair amount of open access that gets purchased or requested via ILL, especially in hybrid journals. This is why we’re excited that Reprints Desk has an open access filter that some libraries are using. As you’re likely aware, finding open access in hybrid publications is often not easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using your estimate of $8-10 per article for ILL, which I find reasonable, you’re correct that the spending on ILL for articles ordered from other libraries via resource sharing would be around $670,000 per year.  SUNY continues to try to minimize this cost by assessing costs of resource sharing systems and networks to ensure that we’re getting our best value for the resource sharing we need to serve our users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we were using the Unsub post-cancellation cost modelling tool, they defaulted to $17 per request based on older estimates from ILL literature. Even with this higher ILL estimate, the model still indicated that most of our campuses should subscribe to only a small group of journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Ok, so as a rough estimate we can say that SUNY Libraries are receiving about 100,000 article requests a year from faculty. Of these about 16,250 will be supplied via document delivery services (at a cost of around $568,750) and some 83,750 will be supplied via ILL (at a cost of about $670,000). So the total cost of fulfilling individual article requests will be around $1.238 million a year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does SUNY operate a mediated document delivery service, or can faculty go online and order documents without the library needing to be involved?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some SUNY institutions provide an unmediated document delivery service, typically facilitated through an ILL workflow. However, most document delivery purchasing comes as a supplement to Interlibrary Loan requests, where libraries are purchasing articles rather than pay copyright royalties, lending fees, or to prevent slow service.  About half of the SUNY institutions are using a locally developed software middleware system called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1072303X.2017.1305034&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Article Gateway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to facilitate unmediated document delivery through ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unmediated document delivery is always provided for a limited number of titles that are most cost effective to use via document delivery article access rather than subscriptions for the entire campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of our campuses are small, but offer advanced degrees in specialized areas. As many STEM publishers use metrics that utilize types and level of programs for subscription rates, document delivery is an attractive option to provide access to resources as subscription costs are often beyond the ability of these small campuses to afford.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Illegal services and big deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You say you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;expect minimal increase in document delivery costs as a result of changing from a big deal to a smaller deal because “Once you provide any barrier such as requesting a purchase, ILL, or anything but directly downloading a PDF or HTML document, the percentage of users who will actually try to request is very small.” Is there any concern that by unbundling the library could encourage users to access illegal services like Sci-Hub?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, SUNY values the work that publishers do, including Elsevier. SUNY wishes to continue its relationship with Elsevier moving forward, as we’ll continue for multiple years to have at least a group of 248 titles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, I think what unbundling does is focus the review not purely on cost per use, which inflates the value of a subscription. This point has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, the focus becomes more on the value of the usage you’re getting for the amount you’re paying, not purely letting usage drive the value discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By looking at link resolver data you can find that users often land on records of articles to which they have access, load the pdf into a browser, but never engage with the article. So, with content they do not have access to they may come to a record but never take the next step of ordering the article via ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We realize that the best case scenario for everyone would be that bundles of the highest quality content were available at prices that were slowly decreasing to acknowledge that the cost of IT infrastructure is going down, so journal hosting prices should go down. But, that’s not the offers that are typically coming from publishers. Library budgets, at least in SUNY, are declining, so increasing costs lead us to make tough decisions about which of the subscriptions to cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposition that unbundling will lead to more use of illegal access and that this is a problem that the library or libraries should solve isn’t one that is fair to libraries. It’s not that libraries are seeking to offer less content to their users; they just can’t afford increasing prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hope that, instead of illegal services becoming more common open access and open science becomes more prevalent and shifts the readership models to open access rather than Sci-Hub or models that aren’t connected to legitimate organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many big deals does SUNY currently have and with whom?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; SUNY is not a consortium that has historically collaborated on big deals for content. This is partially due to the diversity of types of institutions, and partially due to capacity at the central office. The Elsevier Big Deal was the only major full-text deal SUNY had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY has historically had a large package of aggregator content labelled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunyconnect.suny.edu/about.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;SUNYConnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that all campuses subscribe to. However, beyond the Elsevier deal and SUNYConnect, there is currently very little content that the 60 institutions or large groups within the system coordinate purchasing on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY is working to do more coordinated collection activity, and will consider big deals if the offer is appropriate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, with most big deals, there is such a wide variety of content that we don’t anticipate finding many deals that will benefit enough of SUNY to pursue. The overall management overhead for big deals is also something we thought about in depth as we moved from the Elsevier big deal to an unbundled group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With smaller unbundled coordinated collecting, the opportunity to change strategies or to cancel is less overwhelming, and outweighs the benefit of access to journals in bulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Transformative agreements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Has SUNY signed any transformative agreements? If so, with whom? If not does it plan to?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; SUNY as a system, or as individual institutions, has not signed any transformative agreements. At this point, it seems unlikely that SUNY would enter into any large-scale transformative agreements in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The culture and organizational structure of SUNY is such that individual authors have been paying open access fees. Although SUNY libraries are largely supportive of movements towards open such as open access and open educational resources, the financial implications of transformative agreements would be difficult for most SUNY libraries to justify.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY library budgets will continue to be negatively impacted, so the focus will likely be on getting the most relevant access over the next 3-5 years. However, SUNY will continue to ask for terms and discounts for publishing open access as much as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a commitment to dedicate funds away from current access to supporting open access comes into play with negotiations, SUNY will likely continue to prioritize current access. An overlooked portion of the SUNY-Elsevier unbundled deal was a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2020/04/suny-elsevier-deal.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;10% discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Elsevier APCs for SUNY Authors, which is typical of the approach we’ll likely be taking with other deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we can include terms that are advantageous to authors moving towards open access, we’ll do so, but won’t sacrifice access or incur more costs to move from a read to read and publish strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You say that SUNY libraries are not responsible for paying any gold OA fees and that payment data is not centrally managed. Do you think there is a danger that by not being involved in the management of APCs, and by unbundling, SUNY libraries might be risking marginalising themselves to some extent? I note in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/ck8u3/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the authors say, “Studies have shown that interlibrary loan often does not increase following journal cancellations, but rather than being good news, this may represent a decrease in perceived library value by researchers. Open Access will also play a critical and increasing role in this environment, and understanding its relation to the content at hand will be important in building a robust and sustainable research support system.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper also suggests that unbundling could, over the longer term, have a negative impact on smaller institutions that rely on their larger peers to supply ILL requests. I wonder also if, as we see more institutions breaking their Big Deals, the ILL system could start to come under pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you have any thoughts on these matters?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a direct response to the quote about ILL volume not increasing after big deal cancellations representing a decrease in “perceived library value,” this statement indicates something that I’ve never fully understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libraries see it as their responsibility to figure ways to keep providing the same content, even if the deals get worse and cripple the organization further. Why wouldn’t libraries see this not as a referendum on the value of the library, but as an indicator of how much the exact content they were subscribing to mattered. I realize things are always complex in these situations, but libraries shouldn’t tie up their value with keeping specific subscriptions. Libraries offer so much more than just access to articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regarding risking being marginalized if SUNY doesn’t focus on transformative agreements or continuing to find ways to subscribe to large journal packages: I agree that unbundling should signal a shift in how libraries focus on access. And, SUNY certainly isn’t against transformative agreements or subscribing to bundles of journals that make sense financially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, focusing on licensing agreements with publishers as the main vehicle will likely lead to further issues in the future where libraries again cannot sustain the costs of the endeavours they’re focusing on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUNY will be focusing on ways we can help our system’s faculty and staff participate more in open access publishing to make their intellectual property and research more accessible to all.  We can be sure that publishers and vendors will be partners with us as we begin to move more into open access strategies. But, APCs and transformative agreements should be analysed in our overall context regarding increasing access for SUNY faculty, staff, and students and making the output of SUNY faculty, staff, and students more accessible to the larger community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, ILL and availability of articles is something to be aware of, especially if more large subscription reductions and unbundling continue. ILL departments have seen staffing reductions, which has led to a focus on streamlining workflows, and has brought about a decade’s worth of focus in ILL (at least in the US) that has seen most of the innovation going towards automation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What ILL has lacked is a large-scale investment in focusing on the larger ecosystem, which includes better terms in licensing and the ability to offer new services rather than just offering the same services more efficiently. But, I think there’s going to be a real shift in libraries moving more towards collections services, which includes ILL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, Princeton has adopted this model, which focuses on both access and collections. There needs to be better structural support for ILL, so that consortial coordination of collection and access for things like journals can happen. SUNY discussed all of this when we were considering unbundling, and although we focused for the past six months on showing libraries how to arrange and configure alternative access, we’re at a point now where we can focus on more structural issues that use multiple data points when making collection decisions or setting strategic directions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spirit has been strong in SUNY with coordinated collection development via resource sharing and demand driven acquisitions for books for some time, with many libraries seeking to diversify SUNY’s collection if a title isn’t available in SUNY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re hoping that we can coordinate journal access in a similar way, where we have programs where SUNYs cooperate on what journals they subscribe to in order to provide the best access to e-journals for all of SUNY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, vendors will likely be offering more in the way of access options that allows consortia to blend ILL-like access and subscriptions. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coalliance.org/news/sillvr-pilot-streaming-video-resource-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;SILLVR project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for streaming video &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries is one such pilot where the larger consortium is looking to secure both subscriptions and access in a single license.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With ILL and collections access departments blending, libraries should be prepared to look at licensing and subscriptions differently, and find the best blend of subscriptions and bundled access that will get the best value for their institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This should come as no surprise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446532/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; queried the occupational choices of self-selected populations of people at the extremes of visual imagery abilities: those with Aphantasia (n=993 male/981 female) or Hyperphantasia (n=65 male/132 female).

There was also a control group with average scores on the VVIQ, but they were poorly matched on age and education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmv7eNrBI10/XyNDX5TXDJI/AAAAAAAANMM/3SlbJGT3ZNYaLEnA2h01RM42efKxgmqHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Aphantasia%252C%2BHyperphantasia%252C%2BOccupation.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;520&quot; data-original-width=&quot;935&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmv7eNrBI10/XyNDX5TXDJI/AAAAAAAANMM/3SlbJGT3ZNYaLEnA2h01RM42efKxgmqHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Aphantasia%252C%2BHyperphantasia%252C%2BOccupation.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446532/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zeman et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;Percentage of participants with aphantasia and hyperphantasia reporting their occupation as being:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; = Management, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; = Business and ﬁnancial; &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; = Computer and mathematical/Life, physical, social science; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; = Education, training, and library; &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; = Arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; = Healthcare, practitioners and technical. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, people with fantastic visual imagery were more likely to be in arts, design, entertainment, and media, as well as sports (an excellent ability to imagine a pole vault or swing a bat would be very helpful). People with poor to no visual imagery were more likely to choose a scientific or mathematical occupation. These categories are rather broad, however. For instance, “media” includes print media. And artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly do exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study had a number of limitations, e.g. washing out individual differences and relying on introspection for rating visual imagery ability (as noted by the authors). There are more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;binocular rivalry&quot;&gt;objective ways&lt;/a&gt; to test for imagery, but these involve in-person visits. Although the authors were circumspect in the Discussion, they were a bit splashy in the title of their paper (&lt;i&gt;Phantasia–The Psychological Significance Of Lifelong Visual Imagery Vivdness Extremes&lt;/i&gt;). And the condition of “Aphantasia”  existed &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Galton/imagery.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Galton (1880). 'Statistics of Mental Imagery'&quot;&gt;long before&lt;/a&gt; it was named and popularized. But these researchers have caught the imagination of the general public, so to speak:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The delineation of these forms of extreme imagery also clarifies a vital distinction between imagery and imagination: people with aphantasia–who include the geneticist Craig Venter, the neurologist Oliver Sacks and the creator of Firefox, Blake Ross–can be richly imaginative, as visualisation is only one element of this more complex capacity to represent, reshape and reconceive things in their absence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeman A, Milton F, Della Sala S, Dewar M, Frayling T, Gaddum J, Hattersley A, Heuerman-Williamson B, Jones K, MacKisack M, Winlove C.

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Exploring hypothetical thinking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=144827</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is hypothetical thinking? We do it continually. Consider making a decision, from choosing what to eat to choosing what to do about a dangerous disease. In deciding between options, you have to consider each of them, working out what’s likely to happen &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;  you take it, then compare the results. A natural human way to do that is by &lt;em&gt;imagining&lt;/em&gt; taking the given option, and following through that scenario, still “offline” in imagination, but constrained by your background sense of reality. That sense includes innate or learned patterns of expectation about what will happen next, of how things and people in general tend to behave; it also includes your knowledge of your local environment and its particular inhabitants. It may be informed by modern science. Unfortunately, it may also be distorted by various sorts of prejudice and error. Still, we often have to rely on our ability to preview options hypothetically, because we cannot try them all before deciding. Choosing the right option first time can be a matter of life or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical thinking is used for theoretical purposes as well as practical ones. For example, when a mathematician wants to prove that every number with a property P also has a property Q, the most straightforward way to do it is by &lt;em&gt;supposing&lt;/em&gt; that an unspecified number &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; has P, then proving from that hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; also has Q. For that shows that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; has P, &lt;em&gt;then x&lt;/em&gt; has Q. Since &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; could be any number with P, the argument establishes that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; number with P also has Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can get more precise about what such cases have in common. They all involve a procedure for assessing conditional statements of the form “If X, then Y.” For instance, “X” could be “It rains” and “Y” “The match will be cancelled”, or “X” could be “I try to swim across the river” and “Y” “I’ll reach the other side.” The procedure is this. First, suppose X. Then, on that hypothesis, assess Y, using whatever background information is appropriate. Finally, whatever attitude you take to Y on the hypothesis X, take the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; attitude unconditionally to “If X, then Y.” Thus, if you &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is slow, you are a strong swimmer), you unconditionally &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; the conditional statement “If I try to swim the river, I’ll reach the other side.” But if you &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; the conclusion “I’ll reach the other side” on the hypothesis “I try to swim across the river” (the current is fast, you are a weak swimmer), you unconditionally &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; the conditional statement. We may call that procedure the &lt;em&gt;Suppositional Rule&lt;/em&gt;. Although its explicit articulation in words is quite abstract, we implicitly use it in practice all the time. It comes so naturally to us that it may seem almost trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we fail to realize, in unreflectively applying the Suppositional Rule, is that it contains a hidden logical inconsistency. That can be proved in several different ways; &lt;em&gt;Suppose and Tell&lt;/em&gt; has the details. Thus it cannot be 100% reliable. But that does not mean that it is completely useless. It works well enough for practical purposes in most ordinary applications. When restricted to acceptance on the basis of mathematical proof, it works perfectly. But the unrestricted rule, which we use in everyday life, subtly generates contradictions in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suppositional Rule is what psychologists call a &lt;em&gt;heuristic&lt;/em&gt;, a way of answering questions of some kind which is quick and easy to use, but only imperfectly reliable. For example, when we are asked which personal names in a list are the most common, with no access to statistics, we may use their psychological accessibility as a heuristic, a guide to their frequency. In vision, we may use discontinuities in colour as a guide to the edges of solid objects; camouflage exploits the limitations of that heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inconsistency of our heuristic for conditionals helps explain why logicians have had so much trouble understanding the meaning of conditional statements in natural languages. It was already a matter of controversy amongst the ancient Greeks, more than two thousand years ago. The poet Callimachus wrote: “Even the crows on the rooftops are cawing about the question ‘Which conditionals are true?’” It is just as hotly contested today amongst philosophers and linguists. The trouble was that we didn’t realize just what rule we were applying, so its inconsistency was unclear. This affected even the data on which discussion relied, which largely consisted of sample sentences classified as “correct” or “incorrect”—using the inconsistent heuristic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can such a logically flawed heuristic serve us so well in practice? As with other paradoxes uncovered by philosophers, in practice we can get a long way by backing off whenever we bump into a paradox, without trying to understand what it is we have stumbled across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@thanospal?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Thanos Pal&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/exploring-hypothetical-thinking/&quot;&gt;Exploring hypothetical thinking&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/631888840/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/631888840/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/631888840/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/english-idioms-about-family-life-and-conjugal-felicity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;English idioms about family life and conjugal felicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/conjunction-dysfunction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Conjunction dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&quot;CRL and East View Information Services have released the Independent and Revolutionary Mexican Newspapers

(link is external), the third Open Access collection of titles digitized under the Global Press Archive (GPA) CRL Charter Alliance. This collection adds to the growing collection of Open Access material(link is external) available through East View's Global Press Archive program.

The Independent and Revolutionary Mexican Newspapers collection, with a preliminary release of 135,000 pages from 477 titles, will ultimately include approximately 1,000 titles from Mexico’s pre-independence, independence and revolutionary periods (1807-1929). The collection traces the evolution of Mexico during this pivotal period and provides rare documentation of the dramatic events of this era, including coverage of Mexican partisan politics, yellow press, political and social satire, as well as local, regional, national and international news....&quot;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Black Lives Matter movement in the US and elsewhere has rightly brought about a much-needed reexamination of deeply rooted issues around diversity and equity for minorities and marginalized populations. Structural racism and other inequities, for example around gender or status, continue to affect academia world-wide. At PLOS we recognize that we can do better — our journals can and must play a role in addressing concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are not new concerns, and we have been working to make our journals a home for diverse voices. However, we recognize that we need to step up our efforts in a number of areas and commit to doing so. For our journals, this means:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will &lt;strong&gt;assess and survey the diversity of our contributors&lt;/strong&gt;, from the thousands of Academic Editors handling submissions at our journals to our authors and reviewers. This will establish a baseline and allow us to hold ourselves accountable for making measurable positive changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;improve the diversity of our journals and their leadership&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes our internal staff but also our Academic Editors appointed to senior roles. We need to ensure that our journals are representative of broader society as well as the academic community, and that the voices of different communities or groups of researchers are heard and play an integral role in our journals. We commit to proactively seeking out underrepresented communities to redress the balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will continue our efforts to &lt;strong&gt;ensure that all manuscript handling processes are set up to recognize and minimize bias&lt;/strong&gt;. We are reflecting internally on how we can improve our understanding of these issues and minimise any of our own biases, and will work with our Academic Editors and peer reviewers to address any form of bias against authors or their origin in the handling of submitted manuscripts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the scope of each of our journals we &lt;strong&gt;aim to be a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;publishing platform for research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations&lt;/strong&gt;. In doing so, we need to ensure that the study of these populations recognizes the problem of racism and inequalities, and that the topic is covered appropriately in published papers. We need to be mindful of inappropriate discussions of race in relationship with genetics traits for example. Inequalities and racism do affect the well-being of minority populations, and this needs to be considered in public health research settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the obligation to continue to &lt;strong&gt;uphold the highest standards of ethics&lt;/strong&gt;. Research about minorities or other affected populations needs to be conducted to the highest editorial standards and ethics guidelines, and should award credit to contributors from these communities as appropriate.  We will not publish research intended to directly support oppression or persecution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these commitments are items that we will be able to address swiftly, whereas others will take more time to achieve. This topic will therefore be a regular feature on PLOS Blogs, so watch this space. We are committed to pursue these activities in the short as well as long term, and to facilitate change not just at PLOS’ journals, but also in the broader academic community where possible. We count on your support in this endeavor and will appreciate any feedback, help or suggestions for specific actions to take. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Early Sharing: Should You Take the Plunge?</title>

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;What does early sharing accomplish?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientific discovery is a process of continuous vetting and refinement. While immediate access to the latest findings allows for accelerated discoveries, sharing early and transparently also results in more checkpoints throughout the research process for communities to provide feedback. The need for effective and time-sensitive global collaboration has been further emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting early sharing practices helps ensure your research is available as soon as it’s needed, regardless of your field. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing allows for the latest research to be connected without waiting for the final publication. Whether it’s through a preprint, open data set, or accessible protocol, researchers are empowered to cite the latest discoveries in their current research. Learning how and when researchers have adopted early sharing is the first step to contributing to this global movement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before the Study Takes Place&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research question being pursued and the resulting study design create the foundation of a research project. These core elements are often internally reviewed to ensure the resulting study is as sound and focused as possible, but the greater research community typically doesn’t see the methodology of a study until the results and conclusions are published. By preregistering your study protocol early, you enable broader research assessment to begin at the foundation of a study. The study design itself goes through peer review so that potential improvements or flaws are detected before the study actually takes place. When the final research article is ready to be assessed, editors can consider the study’s rigor and adherence to the study design.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help ensure a study follows the highest standards and has long-term reproducibility, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; both offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration options&lt;/a&gt;. Preregistration can help reduce confirmation bias of editors and reviewers by confirming the underlying validity of your research. Additionally, having your protocol published allows others to pursue your study, or to tweak your design to fit their available resources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Initial Findings&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; announced two new &lt;a href=&quot;https://biologue.plos.org/2020/04/14/new-linked-article-types-enable-researchers-to-publish-findings-as-their-work-progresses/&quot;&gt;linked articles types&lt;/a&gt;: Discovery Reports and Update Articles. To alleviate the pressure of having to wait for a fully formed story to develop, Discovery Articles give researchers the flexibility to publish novel initial findings and as a first step. Once the Discovery Report is published, both the original authors and other research groups can augment the initial report by submitting Update Articles for review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As multiple Update Articles can be linked to a single Discovery Report, your initial finding can spring into a series of interconnected advancements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sharing Before Publication&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preprints provide a platform for open, public review that is independent from a journal and doesn’t depend on an invitation from the editor. While the original preprint can be viewed and cited prior to publication, the preprint can be updated as the manuscript is revised to ensure the most recent version of your paper is always available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS makes the interaction between preprint servers and our journals as simple as possible. You can directly submit your preprint to our journals from medRxiv and bioRxiv, or you can include the DOI of your preprint on the submission form if you used a different server. For those in other subjects, there is an ever-growing collection of active &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers&quot;&gt;preprint servers&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, authors of life science articles can opt-in to have the paper uploaded to bioRxiv during submission, without any additional work. Our editors are encouraged to consider comments left on a preprint, allowing for the open review platform that preprints provide to potentially accelerate and deepen the review process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, open and accessible data sets are another opportunity to collaborate among far-spanning researchers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/a-selfish-reason-to-share-research-data/&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that publications that link to data in a repository are cited more frequently on average. As many researchers around the world don’t have access to the infrastructure required to generate their own data sets, making your data available without restrictions is an easy way to ensure your research is maximizing its contribution and usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early sharing opens up opportunities throughout the research process to share study designs, initial findings, and data at a global scale. Involve your communities with early sharing practices so that vetting happens throughout the research process, ultimately improving the credibility of your final research output.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/unsplash-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its spread have affected people across the entire world—but not equally. Many of the same groups of individuals known to suffer a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes are faring especially poorly during this pandemic. In many ways, the disparate outcomes being documented in COVID-19 are simply offering a magnified view of longstanding health inequities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html#:~:text=means%20is%20lacking.-,What%20is%20health%20equity%3F,be%20as%20healthy%20as%20possible.&quot;&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&lt;/a&gt; stated that “&lt;em&gt;Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy&lt;/em&gt;“. To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed. Socially disadvantaged people, who have been historically marginalized and/or disfavored by social and political institutions, have faced significant obstacles to health equity in the midst of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve health equity, obstacles to health must be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html&quot;&gt;Social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, a key recommendation for preventing the spread of COVID-19, has proven to be very difficult for socially disadvantaged persons. Housing insecurity and homelessness are established risk factors for chronic health conditions, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/4/241&quot;&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;. In the setting of COVID-19, these challenges have meant that many individuals cannot feasibly maintain the recommended physical distance from others. Further, for people in service professions that require they interact daily with the public, their ability to socially distance has also been quite challenged. Racial and ethnic minorities and low income persons are overrepresented in such professions, which has increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who have sought testing for COVID-19, inequities in health care access and services have been on full display. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases?t=1595235018970&quot;&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; noted that African Americans patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. cough and fever) were less likely to be given a COVID-19 test than were white persons with the same symptoms. This type of biased delivery of health services can lead to socially disadvantaged individuals presenting later (e.g. for hospitalization) with severe symptoms or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/beloved-brooklyn-teacher-30-dies-coronavirus-denied-covid/story?id=70376445&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.  As vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are developed and disseminated, individuals who have directly, or vicariously, experienced bias in the health care setting may be reticent to seek these options, out of fear of inequitable treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to shortages of food in many communities due to store closures as well as bulk purchases by individuals who can afford to do so. Low-income communities have been particularly affected. A consequence of structural inequities including residential segregation, food access is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379708007290?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;known to vary&lt;/a&gt; by community demographics. In this pandemic, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, may be exacerbated, particularly for persons facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638616306722&quot;&gt;food insecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/04/07/game-plan-to-help-those-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-171863&quot;&gt;Solutions&lt;/a&gt; for addressing the inequities magnified by COVID-19 have been offered and include expanding access to testing and health care, and providing social services to keep vulnerable groups safe. People with kidney diseases are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Because many are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30899864/&quot;&gt;socially disadvantaged&lt;/a&gt;, it will be important to evaluate and expand the services they are provided, including those addressing social needs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/word-clous-april-highlights-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorectal cysts: A simple model system for testing the efficacy of CAR-T cells against malignancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimal CAR T therapy validation requires a 3-D cellular system that mimics the complex tumour cellular architecture. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Dillard et al. report the development of colorectal cysts from a single colorectal cell line Caco-2 as simple and reliable tools to validate CAR T-mediated therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12039&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12039 &quot; height=&quot;306&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fig-1-300x191.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Method principle, taken from the original publication.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR T cells are T lymphocytes, genetically engineered to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) on their surface that recognizes CD19 marker on the surface of B lymphocytes and also promotes signalling events that control the activation of lysis. This results in the destruction of the B lymphocyte. Since CD19 is a widespread marker in cancerous B cells, CAR-T cells are being used as an allogenic treatment of B-cell malignancies.  The CAR T-mediated immunotherapy for cancer has revolutionized the treatment of ‘liquid tumors’, i.e, haematological, however, it hasn’t been so effective in the treatment of solid tumors, as CAR-T cells are unable to survive in the complex tumour microenvironment and target successfully all the tumor-generating cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, using a two-dimensional (2-D) cellular system, in which CAR-T cells are added in a monolayer of cultured target cancer cells, to validate CAR-T cell functionality and specificity, is inadequate, as the 2-D system does not mimic the challenging 3-D morphology and organization of solid tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cancer cells acquire a different gene expression profile when cultured in 3-D spheroids compared to 2-D, which may affect their recognition by CAR-T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to create a simple 3-D cellular system that could be used for the validation of CAR-T cells, the authors took advantage of a colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2, that has been shown to form 3-D cyst-like structures by self-organisation, with the apical surface of the epithelial cells facing a central lumen. First, they transduced Caco-2 cells with the &lt;em&gt;CD19&lt;/em&gt; gene, in a way that ensured cell-surface expression of the CD19 antigen on their surface (CD19Caco-2 cells). Next, they showed that CD19CAR-T cells were able to kill CD19Caco-2 cells, as effectively as in a 2-D culture, while Caco-2 cells remained intact. Finally, they demonstrated that the system was compatible with super-resolution microscopy, high-throughput live imaging and bioluminescence assays; hence the ability of the CAR-T cells to kill the cancer cells and destroy the cyst can be monitored with both qualitative and quantitative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple and versatile method that can be adapted to the use of a variety of cancer lines that have been shown to form similar simple 3-D structures. It could therefore, constitute a powerful tool for the therapeutic validation of CAR-T cells in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-020-00623-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar disease is prevalent in homeless people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerous studies have shown that bipolar disease (BD) is a common disorder among homeless people. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08819-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Ayano et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by pulling existing data from the literature, which confirmed and estimated more accurately the high pooled prevalence of BD among homeless people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BP) is a mental health condition characterized by lengthy periods of extreme mood swings. BP has a prevalence of about 1-2.4 % in the general population, but has been shown to affect 2.41 to 42.42% of homeless people, depending on the study. BD has a severe negative effect in homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of disability, substance/drug abuse. In order to provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice, the authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. From a total of 3236 articles identifies, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for the final systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted. The studies were performed in five countries/continents (Canada, USA, Brazil, Germany, Ireland and France) and were published between 2001 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the random-effects model to account for existing heterogeneity the pooled BD prevalence among homeless people was estimated at 11.4%. Subgroup analysis by country/continent showed the prevalence of BD to be 10% in Europe and 13.2 %  in other countries, while subgroup analysis by the quality of the studies showed a pooled BD prevalence of 9.9% for high-quality studies and 11.8% for both low and moderate-quality studies. These numbers are significantly higher than the ones reported for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12034 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/homeless-person-HL-blog-July-2020-300x270.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely reasons for this increased between BD and homelessness is the co-occurrence of other medical conditions, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, which have been associated with an increased risk of bipolar and other mental illnesses. Also, the possible exposure of homeless people to physical and sexual trauma, which is associated with the onset of manic episodes and bipolar disease in risky groups, may also be a factor. Moreover, the higher co-existence of depression, anxiety, psychosis and alcohol-related disorders in homeless people may also constitute a possible reason for the higher prevalence of BD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the importance of further high-quality studies to determine the etiologies of the high prevalence of BD observed in homeless people and of targeted interventions to prevent and diagnose BD in these individuals. The authors recommend the strengthening of the mental health services for homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating committed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of the shipping industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shipping industry has one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions and needs to take action to reduce such emissions as soon as possible. In a study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00015-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bullock et al. analyses for the first time the committed emissions of the shipping sector taking into consideration individual ship type data from existing and new ships and assesses which measures should be taken to reduce baseline committed emissions to meet the Paris agreement goals for action on climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris agreement goal is to keep the increase of global temperature below 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. For this to be achieved global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions need to be reduced as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping sector is the main contributor of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, estimated at around 800 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year, hence it has set a target of at least 50% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 2050 compared to 2008.  However, until now the committed emissions of shipping, i.e., the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions expected based on existing energy infrastructure, are based on assumptions of ship lifetimes extrapolated from other transport systems. The average scrappage age of ships is 28 years, which is much higher than road transport vehicles, therefore, this practice underestimates committed emissions in shipping. As a result, the ‘carbon budget’, which is the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that can be emitted over time while limiting global warming to the accepted levels of the Paris agreement for shipping industry is estimated to be higher for the shipping industry, than it really should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study the authors analysed committed emissions in 11,000 existing and new ships in the European Union’s new emissions monitoring scheme (EU MRV), taking into account the wide range of ship types, as well as their different sizes and scrappage age, using datasets published for the first time in 2019. It was found that five ship types: container, bulk carriers, ro pax, oil tankers and passenger ships are responsible for 71% of committed emissions, with the highest baseline committed emissions estimated for container ships. In particular, the new containers account for the highest committed emissions, as although they are more efficient, they are much larger than older containers and this has a greater impact. Moreover, passenger ships were found to have disproportionately high emissions, despite their small numbers, due to their long life time. Overall the baseline committed emissions from all existing ships in the EU MRV fleet was found to be 2260 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, much larger than estimated in previous studies. This is equivalent to 85-212% of the carbon budget to achieve the 1.5 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C target that is available for the EU MRV fleet, therefore, significant mitigation measures are required to reduce these figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the combination of four measures: slow speed, technical and operational improvements, fuel blending and the use of zero-carbon fuel, if implemented between 2020s-2030s has the potential to reduce the baseline committed emissions by 65% to 793 MtCO2 and achieve the target of keeping within the Paris agreement carbon budgets, without the need for premature scrappage. However, any delay in appropriate implementation would result in a reduction of only 13% of committed emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that we cannot rely on measures to improve the efficiency of new ships in order to deliver what is decided in the Paris agreement and highlights the need to implement measures on existing ships, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilot study finds: Modified short-term fasting reduces chemotherapy toxicity in gynaecological cancer patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chemotherapy-induced toxicity results in patients postponing chemotherapy or in the reduction of the drugs dose used, thus compromising therapy. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that short-term fasting prior to the onset of chemotherapy has beneficial effects in tolerating chemotherapy. In study published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07041-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Zorn at al. report a significant reduction of toxicity-related symptoms in patients with gynecological cancer, achieved in a controlled cross-over pilot study that used a modified short-term fasting (mSTF) protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy, a consequence of healthy cells being destroyed together with the cancer cells by the drug cocktail. Fasting is believed to protect normal cells from the detrimental effects of chemotherapy, as they enter a state of reduced cell division and stress resistance, upregulation of DNA repair and induced autophagy. In tumor cells on the other hand, growth pathways remain activated, which renders them more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case series study human patients under various fasting regimens were reported to show significantly fewer toxicity-induced symptoms, such as fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, while a randomized control trial showed that a 48-h fasting reduced bone marrow toxicity and DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, a dose-escalation fasting study demonstrated that 72h fasting during chemotherapy was safe and tolerated by the patients, while it resulted in reduced chemotherapy-related toxicity and low-grade fasting-related toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study the authors evaluated the effect of a 96-h fasting on the chemotherapy-induced toxicity in women with gynecological cancer. For the first time the effect of a 6-day intervention of Ketone diet (KD) prior to mSTF on ameliorating the negative effects of fasting was also assessed. The mSTF itself had a ketogenic composition (75% fat, 15% protein and 10% carbohydrate), as it has been shown that fasting achieves best results in a state of ketosis (elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood). The patients, who underwent a calorie restriction to 25% of their daily requirement, as a result of mSTF tolerated the fasting well and experienced much less severe symptoms of chemotherapy-induced toxicity: significantly fewer patients suffered from stomatitis, headaches and weakness and patients also showed significantly less haematological parameters of toxicity during mSTF cycles. Although previous studies had reported reduced cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after STF, in this particular study, this was not observed, possibly because the patients had already overcome these conditions due to preventive medication. Importantly, the patients on mSTM postponed much fewer chemotherapy appointments than the ones on normal diet, which reflects their better tolerance of their treatment and physical condition in general. It was also found that the KD neither reduced fasting-related discomfort nor improved compliance of the fasting regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results clearly show the potential of mSTF in counteracting chemotherapy-related toxicity and enhancing tolerance of treatment. Further larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of mSTF as a supportive approach to chemotherapy, before recommending this treatment to cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Why do so many women find it challenging to stay in postpartum HIV care?</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/AdobeStock_50865517-e1594828279355-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite availability of free HIV care in many low- and middle-income countries, fewer women living with HIV (WLHIV) remain in care in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23374278/&quot;&gt;first year after childbirth&lt;/a&gt; than during &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29287029/&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. WLHIV who do not stay in care do not receive antiretroviral therapy and are at increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1511691&quot;&gt;risk of passing HIV&lt;/a&gt; to their child or partner and may also experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737584/&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; HIV-related health outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 1 in 5 HIV-exposed children in Ghana become infected with HIV by the time of cessation of breastfeeding. This rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the second-highest in West Africa and the fourth-highest among the 21 focus countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20190722_UNAIDS_SFSFAF_2019_en.pdf&quot;&gt;UNAIDS tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why the drop-out rates of HIV care are higher in the postpartum year than during pregnancy are not well understood. Researchers have offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111421&quot;&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt;:  women may fall out of care due to fewer scheduled encounters with the healthcare system, due to a decline in perceived susceptibility of MTCT after childbirth, due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977376/&quot;&gt;prioritization&lt;/a&gt; of their child’s health over their own, or due to challenges with childcare — but there is little evidence to support any one of these theories over the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute toward a better understanding of this issue, we conducted qualitative interviews with thirty postpartum WLHIV in Ghana, recruited in 2016 from two tertiary hospitals in the urban city of Accra. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03067-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents the barriers women themselves described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s accounts suggest that social, economic, and physical health factors, more than a change in individual motivation, may explain why fewer women remain in HIV care in the postpartum year than during pregnancy. Broadly, we found that the social and economic costs of staying in HIV care became higher in the postpartum year and many who dropped out experienced multiple barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ART-related side-effects and HIV denial were the strongest barriers during pregnancy and the fear of re-experiencing the ART-side effects continued to keep mothers away from HIV care even after childbirth. One participant shared her story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During pregnancy, I suffered when I took the drugs due to the side-effects. Thus, anytime I thought of going back for the drugs [after the birth], the thoughts of the side effects came to my mind and troubled me. I became afraid. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of travel and transport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unique barrier in the early postpartum months was difficulty traveling to HIV care due to complications from childbirth or prolonged recovery from a cesarean section. For example, one mother remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most mothers will tell you that the first six months are very tough. Many women take the time to work on themselves since some undergo an operation [i.e., C-section]. Others, too, had a vaginal tear, so they may need some time to take care of themselves. It takes six months or more for a mother to return to a normal life after childbirth [i.e., to be healthy and to visit the HIV treatment centers for care]. Some, too, are single mothers who have no support at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, for a few of the women who had dropped out of care, childbirth was associated with debt, unemployment, or underemployment. This led to a new reliance on others, such as a partner or relative, to give them money before they could make their HIV care visits, even when their motivation to stay in HIV care was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12020 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Fotolia_17246913_Subscription_XL-300x174.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Mode of transportation was the most significant barrier, with increasing costs to mothers facing new sociocultural pressures unique to the postpartum year. Postpartum mothers were motivated to protect their children’s health, and often felt obligated to take a taxi to their clinical appointments instead of the cheaper local bus, called &lt;em&gt;trotro, &lt;/em&gt;which they typically took during pregnancy. Taxis could protect their children from the risk of illness and excessive heat common to the hot and crowded &lt;em&gt;trotros, &lt;/em&gt;but they were more expensive, costing one participant 70% of her monthly salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV stigma also contributed to high transportation costs, as some mothers established their HIV care far from their home to avoid being recognized. Further, those who now needed to rely on financial or childcare support to make it to appointments in their postpartum year would find it difficult to do so without disclosing their HIV status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority of pediatric care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these economic and social challenges, one would expect that mothers who had discontinued from HIV care would also be unable to adhere to their pediatric HIV testing or child well-baby visit schedules. However, we found that all the mothers who had dropped out of HIV care, except one, were engaged with the healthcare system for their child’s health. This behavior suggests that in the context of limited resources, mothers prioritized their children’s health over their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close the pregnancy-postpartum HIV-care retention gap, our results call for a package of interventions that minimize the economic burden of accessing HIV care, diminish stigma, and enhance the management of ART-related side effects. The women in our study recommended that HIV-care providers in Ghana consider extending their medication refills from three to six months. This option will not only reduce transportation costs, but it will also allow mothers to recover physically from childbirth. Ghana has the potential to eliminate MTCT of HIV; doing so will require a concerted and deliberate effort to support postpartum WLHIV to stay in HIV care.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/uploads/documents/2018/7/workplace.pdf&quot;&gt;70 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have an eating disorder and, with the prevalence of disordered eating on the rise,  it’s clear that this presents a significant public health issue. Despite this, many myths and misconceptions abound that are significant barriers to both treatment and public understanding of eating disorders. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, gender, or cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together a list of books that provide practical information to dispel misconceptions, as well as guidance for people affected by eating disorders and their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/if-your-adolescent-has-an-eating-disorder-9780190076825&quot;&gt;If Your Adolescent Has An Eating Disorder: An Essential Guide for Parents &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;B. Timothy Walsh and Deborah R. Glasofer &lt;img height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eating-dis-147x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;144&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an authoritative guide to understanding and helping a teenager with an eating disorder. It is designed for parents of teens who have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or who are at risk of developing one, and for other adults, such as teachers and guidance counselors, who are regularly in contact with at-risk adolescents. The book combines the latest science–including the newest treatments and most up-to-date research findings on eating disorders–with the practical wisdom of parents who have been raising teens with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-9780190926601&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders: What Everyone Needs to Know&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;B. Timothy Walsh, Evelyn Attia, and Deborah R. Glasofer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practical yet authoritative, this book defines eating disorders, explains what we know about them based on the latest science, and describes how treatment works. The book dispels common myths about eating disorders, such as the notion that they occur only amongst the affluent, that they affect only girls and women, or that they simply result from environmental factors such as the fashion industry and society’s obsession with thinness. This book is essential reading for those seeking authoritative and current information about these often-misunderstood illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-void-inside-9780190061166&quot;&gt;The Void Inside: Bringing Purging Disorder to Light&lt;/a&gt; by Pamela K. Keel&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/void-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book chronicles the growing recognition of purging disorder at the turn of the millennium, reviews what science has taught us about the illness, and explains the medical complications that purging may bring. The author, known for her work identifying and naming purging disorder, presents irrefutable evidence that it can no longer be considered a subset of better-known eating disorders. Keel illuminates how the illness impacts the lives of real people to underscore the severity of this hidden eating disorder and the need for greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exposure-therapy-for-eating-disorders-9780190069742&quot;&gt;Exposure Therapy for Eating Disorders  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Carolyn Black Becker, Nicholas R. Farrell, and Glenn Waller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is designed to augment existing eating disorder treatment manuals by providing clinicians with practical advice for maximizing the effectiveness of exposure, regardless of clinical background or evidence-based treatment used. Suitable for use with a range of diagnoses, this easy-to-use guide describes the most up to date empirical research on exposure for eating disorders. The book also provides strategies for overcoming obstacles, including institutional resistance to implementation of exposure therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/handbook-of-positive-body-image-and-embodiment-9780190841874&quot;&gt;Handbook of Positive Body Image and Embodiment  &lt;/a&gt;by Tracy L. Tylka and Niva Piran&lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EXrVViuTSC0-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is the first comprehensive, research-based resource to address the breadth of innovative theoretical concepts and related practices concerning positive ways of living in the body. Presenting chapters by world-renowned experts in body image and eating behaviors, the handbook explores how therapeutic interventions and public health and policy initiatives can inform scholarly, clinical, and prevention-based work in the field of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eating-disorders-the-facts-9780198715603&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders: The Facts &lt;/a&gt;by Suzanne Abraham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sympathetically and clearly written, this guide considers why eating disorders occur, and then looks at each in turn, describing the eating behaviours, diagnosis, and treatments available. Case histories and patient perspectives provide insights into the mind of the eating disorder sufferer, making it easier for patients and their families to relate to the topics discussed. The book&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides an authoritative resource on eating disorders that will prove valuable for sufferers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These titles highlight some of the most pressing issues in the field of eating disorder research. Greater awareness among stakeholders – including healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers, and the general public – can address ongoing challenges and inform future directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/vintage-book-light-bulb-wood-table_1007385.htm&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; by jannoon028 via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/six-books-to-help-us-understand-eating-disorders/&quot;&gt;Six books to help us understand eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/630516433/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/630516433/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2feating-dis-147x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/630516433/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-emerging-adults-can-manage-the-uncertainty-of-the-future-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How emerging adults can manage the uncertainty of the future [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/why-chemical-imbalance-is-the-wrong-way-to-talk-about-depression/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why chemical imbalance is the wrong way to talk about depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: A balancing act: gender and welfare regimes in the association between work-life conflict and poor health</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/16/a-balancing-act-gender-and-welfare-regimes-in-the-association-between-work-life-conflict-and-poor-health/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/work-life-balance-5333802_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us find it increasingly difficult to separate our work from our personal lives. Modern technologies exacerbate the problem, with our inability to ‘switch off’ and tendency to take calls and check emails outside of working hours. What’s more, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for those of us working from home, where the line between our jobs and family lives has become even more blurred, and for those working longer shifts in hospitals, supermarkets or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already known that work-life imbalances can negatively affect both our physical and mental health. However, we know little about the factors that strengthen or weaken this association. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09139-w/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;New research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at the influence of gender and level of welfare provision by the state on the link between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Mensah and Adjei analyze data from over 32,000 workers, aged 16 to 64, from 30 European countries. This data was collected as part of the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; European Working Conditions Survey, carried out in 2015 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors perform statistical analysis on the association between work-life balance and self-reported health, which previous studies have found to be a reliable proxy of overall health, and factor in other variables such as gender and welfare regime. Validating earlier studies, the results show that there is a significant association between work-life balance and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender differences in the association between work-life conflict and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional gender roles permeate our everyday levels such that, in many cultures, women more often take on a caring role within the family unit and men are seen as the so-called ‘breadwinner’. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/12951&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;This is changing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the last 40 years seeing increased participation of women in the labor market and a rise in the number of dual-earning families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, does gender affect the association between work-life conflict and self-reported health? Mensah and Adjei find that while men more often report a poor work-life balance across different European countries, there is generally a stronger association between poor work-life balance and poor health among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of reasons for this. Women still bear the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;greater burden of childcare responsibilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, creating additional pressures at home as well as in the workplace. Women also face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/workplace-gender-discrimination-remains-rife-survey-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased discrimination at work and lower rates of pay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which may contribute to the impact of work-life conflict on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of the welfare state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12015 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/postit-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;The strength of this study’s large cross-European sample is that it enables comparison between groups of countries with different welfare regimes, with countries classified as Nordic (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway), Conservative (such as Germany and Switzerland), Liberal (UK and Ireland), Southern Europe (such as Greece, Spain and Italy) and Central and Eastern Europe (including Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Croatia and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mensah and Adjei report that work-life balance is best for both working men and women in the Nordic countries. There is also a weaker association between poor work-life balance and poor self-reported health in these countries, which the authors attribute to their substantial welfare provision including availability of childcare, universal healthcare and long parental leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association between work-life conflict and poor health is strongest in countries with Liberal and Conservative welfare regimes, with Conservative states also being the only ones where the association is stronger in men than in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors may be at play here, including increased emphasis on the male breadwinner role, weaker employment regulation and unions, and more stringent social welfare than the Nordic states. However, it remains to be established why Southern European states, with the least generous welfare policies, fared better. Further work is also needed to determine the specific contribution of individual policies on work-life conflict and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking a healthy balance in future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, the findings of this study may help us to reflect on how often we allow commitments at work encroach on our personal lives and negatively impact our health. So how might we guard against the stresses and strains of work-life conflict in future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity, recommends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/w/work-life-balance&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a number of measures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; including better prioritization of tasks at work, taking proper breaks in the working day, dedicating time for exercise or hobbies, and keeping a record of time spent working or thinking about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points to systemic differences to be addressed by governments and policymakers. As we strive towards equality, the differential impact of working practices, employment law and welfare policies on women and men’s health must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, countries vary widely in political and economic landscape and so too does the level of social and financial intervention by the state, but strategies to help minimize work-life conflict would surely pay dividends in fostering a healthier population and workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Towards a new approach to reveal dynamical organization of the brain using topological data analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper &quot;Towards a new approach to reveal dynamical organization of the brain using topological data analysis&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how our brains dynamically adapt for efficient functioning. Most
previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of
brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by
collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s
dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall
organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an
interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using
existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of
transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and
between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4–9 s) than before. The
individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task
performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into
interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Amir Khan will talk about the paper &quot;Spiking Neural Networks Evolved to Perform Multiplicative Operations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplicative or divisive changes in tuning curves of individual neurons to one stimulus (&quot;input&quot;) as another stimulus (&quot;modulation&quot;) is applied, called gain modulation, play an important role in perception and decision making. Since the presence of modulatory synaptic stimulation results in a multiplicative operation by proportionally changing the neuronal input-output relationship, such a change affects the sensitivity of the neuron but not its selectivity. Multiplicative gain modulation has commonly been studied at the level of single neurons. Much less is known about arithmetic operations at the network level. In this work we have evolved small networks of spiking neurons in which the output neurons respond to input with non-linear tuning curves that exhibit gain modulation—the best network showed an over 3-fold multiplicative response to modulation. Interestingly, we have also obtained a network with only 2 interneurons showing an over 2-fold response.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines are here</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12010</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/15/the-new-arrive-2-0-guidelines-are-here/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ARRIVE-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals&quot;&gt;BMC Series&lt;/a&gt; journals, it is important that the research we consider and publish can be utilised and is trusted.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of animals has been considered and that the harm involved is justified by the expected benefit of the research. To support us, we utilise tools such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;Animal research: reporting &lt;em&gt;In Vivo &lt;/em&gt;Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the integrity and soundness of submissions that report on animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/&quot;&gt;NC3Rs&lt;/a&gt; developed the ARRIVE guidelines; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NC3Rs-ARRIVE-Guidelines-Checklist-fillable.pdf&quot;&gt;20 point checklist&lt;/a&gt; covering measures associated with bias (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, data handling) with the aim to improving the quality of both scientific research design and reporting of animal studies. The guidelines prompt authors to provide sufficient detail in their research paper that would allow the reader to assess the methodological rigour of the experiment, determine the reliability of the findings, and to reproduce and build upon the work. Unfortunately, the argument for the success of ARRIVE has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197882&quot;&gt;varied&lt;/a&gt; since its launch, and despite being widely endorsed by journals, funding bodies and research institutions, the quality of reporting in animal research publications is still far from roubust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems encountered using the ARRIVE 2010 guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Editor, I have noticed that authors use the ARRIVE checklist in different ways. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001756&quot;&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt; adoption of ARRIVE by journals, many authors, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-10&quot;&gt;editors&lt;/a&gt;, are still not aware of these guidelines, or see them as an unnecessary box ticking exercise. This lack of awareness can also affect how authors plan their research where issues related to bias may not have been appropriately considered, and this has a knock-on-effect at the manuscript writing stage. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we often receive ARRIVE checklists that are incomplete or don’t correspond to what is reported in the paper. These issues could be related to language barriers or differences in research culture where authors are still not fully aware of the consequences of incomplete reporting. Alternatively, it may be related to the misconception that admitting to non-compliance of an ARRIVE item will disqualify a manuscript from being published. Overall, comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task for editors and reviewers when evaluating the robustness of the methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;comparing an ARRIVE 2010 checklist against a manuscript can be an onerous task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in an attempt to improve uptake, an international working group was formed to review the original ARRIVE 2010 guidelines and develop a strategy that would make ARRIVE easier for researchers, editors and reviewers to use. We are pleased to announce that the new ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines have been published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt; and re-published by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02451-y&quot;&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE 2.0 – what has changed?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall guidelines have been simplified. Items from the original checklist have been updated and reorganised and are now presented in two categories: the ‘&lt;strong&gt;ARRIVE Essential 10&lt;/strong&gt;’ and ‘&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Set&lt;/strong&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘ARRIVE Essential 10’ is a list of key items that authors should address in their manuscript text as a minimum standard and represents best practice. If adhered to, reporting of these items should have the biggest impact on improving the quality and reliability of animal research studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second list of recommendations is designed to provide greater context and background to the study. This includes items such as conflicts of interest, protocol registration, and animal housing and welfare aspects. While not strictly essential, these points will add value to the review process, enhancing the transparency of the study design and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000411&quot;&gt;Explanation and Elaboration&lt;/a&gt; (E&amp;amp;E) document has also be made available. This helps to describe each of the ARRIVE 2.0 items in greater context and detail, and includes best practice examples from the published literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARRIVE 2.0 update joins a host of other ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021&quot;&gt;initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address factors contributing to poor reproducibility.  There is still much work to be done to engage key stakeholders to create a process whereby these standards can be consistently implemented and enforced at the research planning stage, and then hopefully mandated by all journals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/07/14/lets-take-a-look-at-your-kidneys/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number one cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease is diabetes, and the gold standard for diagnosing any kidney disease is through biopsy. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-biopsy&quot;&gt;kidney biopsies&lt;/a&gt; are not without risks, and although minimal, there is a risk of bleeding and damaging the kidney further by performing this invasive procedure. In addition, some patients cannot have a kidney biopsy when they truly need one because of other comorbidities, anti-coagulant medications, and other factors that make them high risk for complications. Usually for patients with diabetes that present no other concerning findings, the nephrologist might assume its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/kidney-disease.html&quot;&gt;diabetic nephropathy&lt;/a&gt;, a complication of diabetes, without performing a kidney biopsy.  Could they be making a mistake?  It might be something else that is treatable.  Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there another test we could do?  What if there was an alternative for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy that is noninvasive and low risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;BMC Neprhology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01902-w&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, examine the potential use of specialized ultrasound – three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound – to diagnose diabetic nephropathy.  This technology takes a large series of 2-D ultrasound images in rapid succession which are then assembled by a computer to create a 3-dimensional image. For pregnant women, a 3-D ultrasound may have been offered to you to look at your growing baby.  Contrast enhanced ultrasound uses intravenous contrast agents consisting of microbubbles/nanobubbles of gas, which oscillate creating an “echo” when exposed to ultrasound waves. This is a better alternative when a patient cannot get contrast agents for a CT or MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-12008 size-shareaholic-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Kidney-blog-1-640x452.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li and colleagues used these two technologies to examine 115 patients with diabetes and kidney disease that underwent kidney biopsy to see if they could differentiate between diabetic nephropathy from non-diabetic renal disease (i.e., IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy).  Sixty-four had diabetic nephropathy and 51 had non-diabetic renal disease. We know that diabetic nephropathy is more likely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/8/10/1718&quot;&gt;longer history of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and with other&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168822705000458&quot;&gt; microvascular complications&lt;/a&gt; (like retinopathy).  Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;’s data was consistent with these previous studies. They didn’t find any differences with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.  However, they did find that using a logistic regression model for BMI and right kidney volume was statistically significant.  They concluded that 3-D ultrasound has the potential to be an option in our arsenal for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; is one of a many researchers looking at utilizing 3-D ultrasound for diagnosing and managing kidney pathology.  Not surprisingly it’s been looked at for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306987/&quot;&gt;determining kidney volume in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009042951830774X&quot;&gt;Calio &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examined 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasound use in surveillance for renal cell carcinoma recurrence after ablation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my clinical practice, I’m not running out to get a 3-D ultrasounds just yet, but I’m keeping it in mind for the future. After further studies, I might be ordering it for that diabetic patient with chronic kidney disease to make sure I’m not missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Improving Research Assessment in the Triage Phase of Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18267</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Qzkv2xVliT0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Helen Sitar is the community coordinator for DORA and a Science Policy Programme Officer at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; EMBO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and Anna Hatch is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;’s program director. &lt;em&gt;DORA receives financial support from PLOS via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When seeking to fill an open faculty position, it’s common for universities to receive hundreds of applications for a single job. Unsurprisingly, such a high level of competition creates a bottleneck early in the hiring process. The ‘triage’ phase of review therefore becomes a critical point, as it determines which applicants receive further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ability to efficiently yet effectively triage applications has been a long-standing challenge for the academic community. Time constraints make triage prone to the influence of unintended biases and proxy measures of success, such as the journals where the candidate has published or their institutional affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, consistency between reviewers presents another challenge.  Even when selecting for the same purpose, processes and standards can vary greatly between individual reviewers or committees, due to differing assumptions about the process or the criteria for making judgments. Reviewers may prefer certain institutions, labs, or journals, or attach different values to funding track records. If reviewers are unaware of their own biases for certain community affiliations, these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-to-combat-bias-in-hiring/9a403c85-c162-4a28-9464-5ff2d5ea9371&quot;&gt;can influence decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, biased hiring processes impede underrepresented and minoritized scholars from making progress in their academic careers, resulting in inequalities in academic leadership and more. Without any intervention, one current model of postdoc to faculty transitions suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not increase significantly&lt;/a&gt; until 2080.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing three approaches to triage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stimulate discussion of the challenges associated with the triage process, and to identify possible solutions, DORA organized an interactive session for the 2019 ASCB | EMBO Meeting. Through a mock-review exercise, participants worked in small groups to test different approaches to the triage process. The seventeen participantsーrepresenting different groups and career stages, including postdocs, faculty members, administrators, publishers, and staff from other non-profit initiativesーwere given the description of a faculty position to ‘hire,’ general instructions on how to conduct the triage, and a set of anonymized application materials (CVs and cover letters). Because the session was limited to 75 minutes, other application materials, including letters of reference, teaching statements, and diversity statements, were not included in our informal exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application materials were anonymized, and the author names from the references listed in the bibliographies were also removed. A note under each reference, however, indicated the applicant’s position in the author list (e.g. “2nd author, 8 authors total”). The CVs and cover letters provided to two of the participant groups were further altered, by removing institutional names and journal titles when they were presented. One of these groups was provided with an assessment matrix to guide the evaluation of different competency areas: research, teaching and mentorship, equity and inclusion, and service to scientific or academic communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By informally experimenting with these triage approaches, our goal was to understand what information people use to make judgments during the triage phase. We were also keen to surface ideas about improving the triage process. Below we summarize the discussion and insights that emerged from our exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVs are littered with names, including those of applicants’ advisors, collaborators, coauthors, and references, which may yield strong associations for reviewers. These names can divert the reviewer’s focus from the work presented and onto the context and community in which it has been conducted. One way that names have the potential to mislead reviewers is through ingroup favoritism, wherein reviewers may gravitate towards the individuals that present affiliations most like themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, some individuals did not notice that names had been omitted from the application materials in our exercise. And others reported that it did not negatively impede the review process. Without names, participants found they became more attentive to the remaining details. For example, one group reported paying greater attention to the institutions where candidates received their training.  But relying on the names of institutions is also problematic, because they do not speak directly to the accomplishments or contributions of an individual, which should be the focus when hiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institution and journal prestige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the lack of institutional and journal names in materials did not detract from the participants’ ability to understand an applicant’s profile, as long as sufficient detail on their academic record had been included. Specifically, participants were interested in knowing how an applicant had contributed to the community at large, or to their department or research group, as this is a better indicator of their skills than their institutional affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Journal names were deemed generally unnecessary as well, especially when an applicant had provided a brief 2-4 sentence explanation summarizing what an article achieved and their specific contribution. This is not the first time DORA has received this feedback; it was suggested at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/1fd1018c/research-assessment-reducing-bias-in-the-evaluation-of-researchers&quot;&gt;previous conference session in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants who saw journal names in the application materials reported that they realized they were using them as a way of evaluation; these participants proposed that their assessments might have been fairer had the journal titles been removed. However, participants still wanted access to the articles’ DOIs to make papers easier to find, read, and evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One group reported that in the absence of journal names, they paid more attention to the author order and used this to determine the importance of the applicants’ contributions to each work. But others argued that knowing the authorship order for a publication did little to indicate an applicant’s role in contributing to a paper or project, and therefore was not particularly useful information. Tools like the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://casrai.org/credit/&quot;&gt;CRediT&lt;/a&gt;) can help parse apart how an individual contributed to an article or project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details instead of names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem with preferring candidates with well-known labs, institutions or awards named on their CVs is that by valuing reputation, departments narrow their search for talent to within known spheres. In doing so, they will miss out on hiring great researchers who have yet to be recognized by a prestigious award or hired into a well-known lab. When personal, institution, and journal names were removed at the same time in our exercise, some participants noticed that many CVs lacked details necessary to understand applicants’ skill areas. Some such details may have been in materials, such as teaching statements or reference letters, not available for the exercise. The reaction of participants to omission of these details from applicants’ CVs and cover letters underscores the importance of communicating one’s own research interests, approach to science, unique skills, and teaching and mentoring abilities. Only with this information can reviewers accurately evaluate candidates and suitability to a particular faculty role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was some disagreement regarding the necessity of including several details common to applicant CVs, including assessing candidates based on their receipt of awards or grants. Some participants paid close attention to mentions of grants, and attributed great value to the fact that an applicant had received an independent grant. Others debated the level of confidence one should have in a person’s abilities based on their receipt of grants, as this can contribute to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect&quot;&gt;“Mathew effect”&lt;/a&gt; of people already recognized receiving further recognition because of previous awards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the triage process, it is clearly important for reviewers to be able to quickly find relevant information. The necessity of this was a major topic of discussion in our session, particularly when it came to the question of being able to compare candidates with ease. The lack of consistent organization of CVs made it complicated for participants to find the relevant information needed to make judgments of applicant’s strengths in various areas (e.g. research, teaching, leadership, inclusivity, service). Moreover, some applicants’ CVs were much longer than others, which reviewers found cumbersome as the length made finding specific pieces of information even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the need for organized CVs, the concept of a structured narrative format was mentioned in our discussions as an option to build consistency into the triage process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/&quot;&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2019/11/14/quality-over-quantity-how-the-dutch-research-council-is-giving-researchers-the-opportunity-to-showcase-diverse-types-of-talent/&quot;&gt;Dutch Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicv.ch/&quot;&gt;Swiss National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; are each experimenting with standard structured narrative CV formats. So far, the Dutch Research Council has received mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/04/14/doras-first-funder-discussion-updates-from-swiss-national-science-foundation-wellcome-trust-and-the-dutch-research-council/&quot;&gt;positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its new narrative. Reviewers report appreciating the added context the narrative format provides, and the Council has found that it leads to a more diverse selection of researchers. Some participants in our session, however, were skeptical of enforcing a standard template CV, noting that it could restrict creativity and limit applicants in describing work which may not fit neatly into any of the preconceived categories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing judgments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every reviewer has their own ‘way’ of sorting through applications, and specific criteria that they look for when deciding who to ‘keep’ or ‘eliminate’ in a triage round of review. In our session, participants using an assessment matrix advocated for a short discussion between reviewers to find a common set of standards before embarking on the triage process, as a way to increase consistent decision making and help minimize the effects of implicit bias. The Germans call this process towards reaching a collective agreement—‘&lt;em&gt;abstimmen’&lt;/em&gt;. Directly translated it means “off-voting,” or voting before one begins something. Asking reviewers to calibrate how they interpret the categories in the rubric would ideally result in more consistent assessment of all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overarching framing for the discussion was the tension between the need for efficient, accurate assessment versus the burden of devoting attention to details in every application. While some participants stated firmly that the use of rubrics may slow down the triage process, the group generally agreed that rubrics allow for uniform standards to be applied and that consistency should be valued. Still, a few others were resistant, stating that it was not desirable to ‘over-engineer’ the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universities and research funders are increasingly reconsidering the relevance and importance of researchers’ contributions when assessing them for hiring, promotion or funding. Across the DORA and wider research communities, there are numerous discussions on how to demonstrate the value of different contributions, whether it be via descriptive narratives, article-level metrics, teaching evaluations, or other means. The triage process is the front line to further review and consideration—and is therefore both important and influential in determining the makeup of the research community and its leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scholarly community has not yet reached a consensus regarding which methods for evaluation are best suited to different purposes or situations, and many believe that there will never be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to research evaluation. Yet demands for employment and funding continue to grow, resulting in more challenges for applicants and review committees in every selection process. And as the number of PhD graduates continues to exceed the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/digest/nsf16300.pdf&quot;&gt;available positions in academia&lt;/a&gt;, academics can expect the triage process for applications to become ever more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instilling standards and structure into research assessment processes, especially during the triage phase of review for faculty searches, appears to be a particularly robust option for reducing bias. To achieve this, universities can ask applicants to use a structured narrative CV template. Institutions can also develop evaluation assessment matrices and have conversations amongst reviewers to set standards and identify desirable applicant qualities and characteristics. By removing journal titles and replacing them with 2-4 sentence article summaries that articulate key findings and specify the researcher’s contributions, reviewers would be provided with information better suited to judging researchers’ contributions at the triage stage. When researchers and institutions reflect on and carefully choose what types of information are used to judge scholarly contributions, evaluation processes can be brought into alignment with community values.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
