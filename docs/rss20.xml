	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Children Are Much Less Likely Than Adults To Prioritise Human Over Animal Lives</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/27/children-are-much-less-likely-than-adults-to-prioritise-human-over-animal-lives/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Two boats are sinking and you can save only one. One holds two dogs, the other a person. Which do you save? If you’re not sure, you can say, ‘I can’t decide.’” When I put this to my 11-year-old, his response was immediate: “Save the dogs!” In his defence, he has grown up with a pet dog, which he adores — and, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, most other kids would say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To adults, these findings might seem a little alarming. Indeed, when the team put similar questions (varying the numbers of dogs, pigs and people) to adult participants, 61% opted to save one human over 100 dogs (which does mean of course that nearly 40% didn’t), and 85% of people prioritised one human over one dog, while 93% opted to save a human rather than a single pig (3% went for the pig).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team asked 249 kids aged between five and nine about what they thought, though, they found that just over 70% opted to let a person die to save 100 dogs. When it came to one human vs one dog, only about a third of the children opted to save the person, 28% were clear on going for the dog, and the rest couldn’t decide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41239&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When pigs, rather than dogs, were pitted against people, the children’s responses were also revealing. Of course, pigs are not generally kept as pets, but for many of these urban, US-based kids (whose religion, if any, was not ascertained), are rather sources of food. And yet only 57% prioritised one human over one pig, and 18% reported that they’d save the pig. The child’s age had no impact — the 9-year-olds made the same judgements as the 5-year-olds. However, both kids and adults who had regular exposure to dogs showed less of bias in favour of people over dogs; for the kids, this also extended to a lower bias in favour of people over pigs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study of fresh groups of adult and child participants, the team kept the same varying human vs dog or pig ratios but altered the question to ask what “Mr X”, who “always does the right thing” would do. They did this to be very clear that they were asking for moral judgements. The results were very similar to those from the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team had also asked the adults and kids to rate humans’, dogs’ and pigs’ intelligence and also capacity to feel pain, sadness and fear. Both adults and kids gave similar ratings for all three species, and agreed that people scored higher on these counts than dogs, who scored higher than pigs. “Yet despite this,” the team notes, “children and adults gave different moral judgements, which suggests that perceived intelligence and sentience does not fully account for moral judgements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do adults have a much stronger pro-human bias? The team suspect that this is something that is learned relatively late in childhood. “Adolescents may learn and internalise the socially held speciesist notion — or ideology — that humans are morally special and deserve full moral status, whereas animals do not,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They do note, however, that their groups of US-based, primarily white, English-speaking participants from mostly urban areas is not exactly globally representative. It would be interesting, of course, to explore whether kids who grow up on farms, say, have different ideas about the relative importance of particular animals vs humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given my son’s (not unexpected) reaction to the dog vs people questions, the findings on kids are a little reassuring: he’s not unusual in feeling that way. I’m fairly sure, though, that if I’d got more personal, and asked him to choose between saving his younger brother or Dottie, our dog, he’d have gone for his brother, if only for my sake… I can tell him that he’s less “speciesist” than me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;Children Prioritize Humans Over Animals Less Than Adults Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: How coronavirus variants may pose challenges for COVID-19 vaccines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095729</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 emerge, a slew of new studies suggest that some may be able to evade immune responses triggered by a previous infection or by a vaccine. That worry has already prompted some vaccine makers to look for ways to tweak their shots to keep up with these troublesome newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers had been concerned that mutations in a viral protein that helps the coronavirus break into cells could dampen the immune response against the virus. The new studies suggest that some viral variants may escape at least some of that immunity, which could put people who have been vaccinated or who have already recovered from a bout of COVID-19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong&quot;&gt;at risk of getting infected&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “we should urge caution, but not panic,” says Mark Slifka, a microbiologist and immunologist at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland. “The immune system has multiple backups” to cope with ever-changing viruses, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;What’s more, it should be straightforward — at least in principle — to update vaccines that rely on parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety&quot;&gt;coronavirus’s genetic code&lt;/a&gt; to trigger an immune response (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/20&lt;/em&gt;). And while some virus mutations could put a dent in how well the vaccines work, currently authorized shots have a long way to fall before they might become ineffective, Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to President Biden, said in a Jan. 21 news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval&quot;&gt;proved highly effective in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/18/20&lt;/em&gt;), with an efficacy of about 95 percent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that COVID-19 vaccine candidates should have an efficacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean&quot;&gt;at least 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; for emergency use authorization (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/4/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Mix of mutations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viruses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants&quot;&gt;mutate all the time&lt;/a&gt;, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is no exception (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). While most changes have little to no effect on how the virus behaves when it infects a person, a few rare alterations can make some viral variants more dangerous to people, such as making a virus more transmissible or deadly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another danger can arise if a mutation helps the virus elude the body’s immune response. Protection from any virus comes, in part, in the form of immune proteins called antibodies, which latch on to proteins on the virus. The immune proteins can prevent the virus from getting into other cells or spur other immune cells into action. Mutations in viral proteins can weaken or prevent that binding, making the antibody response less effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such problematic mutations are now appearing in a few versions of the coronavirus that researchers are tracking. A virus variant called B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread&quot;&gt;appears to be more transmissible&lt;/a&gt; than its close relatives, giving it a potential evolutionary advantage (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/22/20&lt;/em&gt;). Researchers are also monitoring the spread of a variant in South Africa dubbed 501Y.V2 that has some of the same mutations as B.1.1.7, as well as other changes. Another potentially concerning variant called P.1 has emerged in Manaus, Brazil — a region that was already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-brazil-city-manaus-herd-immunity&quot;&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt; by the pandemic in 2020 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The South Africa variant has yet to be detected in the United States. But the U.K. variant, already circulating in 24 states, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;could become the dominant strain&lt;/a&gt; in the country in March (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/21&lt;/em&gt;). And the first U.S. case of the Brazil variant was reported January 25 in someone who had traveled to the South American country.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Vaccines versus variants&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been investigating how these variants might respond to vaccines, and some versions of the coronavirus are more concerning than others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of B.1.1.7 for instance, antibody-containing serum taken from the blood of 23 people who had received Pfizer’s vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249840v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;can still stop the variant from infecting human cells&lt;/a&gt; in lab dishes, researchers report in a preliminary study posted January 20 at medRxiv.org. That immune response to B.1.1.7, however, was lower in some samples compared with a version of the new coronavirus that doesn’t have those mutations. Another preliminary study posted January 19 at bioRxiv.org found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426911v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;the immune responses from Moderna’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt; were similar to those from Pfizer’s against the new variant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some data for coronavirus variant 501Y.V2, however, are more troubling. Antibodies in the serum of 21 out of 44 people who had recovered from COVID-19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427166v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;lost the ability to neutralize the new viral variant&lt;/a&gt; in lab-grown cells, researchers report in a preliminary study posted January 19 at bioRxiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A separate, small preliminary study of six recovered patients found that the antibodies from those people had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250224v1&quot;&gt;a wide range of virus-fighting abilities&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report January 26 at medRxiv.org. Antibodies from one person completely lacked the ability to stop 501Y.V2 from infecting cells. The other five people had antibodies that were between a sixth to one two-hundredths as potent against 501Y.V2 as they were against the version of the coronavirus behind South Africa’s first wave of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, early results also suggest that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.427948v1&quot;&gt;the Moderna vaccine should still work against both B.1.1.7 and 501Y.V2&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report January 25 in a preliminary study posted at bioRxiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team took blood samples from eight people who had received the Moderna vaccine in a Phase I clinical trial, and then tested the samples in lab dishes to see if the new virus variants could still infect the cells. The immune response to B.1.1.7 and to a coronavirus variant that didn’t have the potentially problematic mutations was similar. But it was only a sixth as effective at preventing 501Y.V2 from getting into cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, that level of activity is &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against&quot;&gt;robust enough to protect monkeys from developing COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;l when exposed to a different version of the coronavirus, Moderna reported in a Jan. 25 news release. That suggests that even though immunity sparked by the vaccine has diminished in the face of 501Y.V2, vaccinated people might still have some level of protection from the new variant. It’s possible that people who have recovered from a previous bout of COVID-19 and whose antibody levels might have waned may be more susceptible to reinfection with 501Y.V2 than other variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These reports are worrisome,” says Nina Luning Prak, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Still, she says, “you’ve got multiple shots on goal.” People make myriad antibodies that attack many different parts of a viral target, making it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-delay-second-dose-dangerous-strains&quot;&gt;difficult for a virus to escape all of them at once&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/14/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have mainly focused on neutralizing antibodies, which stop viruses from infecting host cells and could prevent a viral infection in the first place. While antibodies from 21 recovered patients could no longer stop the variant from getting into cells in the Jan. 19 bioRxiv.org study of 501Y.V2, other antibodies still attached to the virus but did not neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the body, those non-neutralizing antibodies could activate other immune cells to eliminate the coronavirus, Slifka says. Plus, people who have recovered from infections have long-lasting immune cells that stick around in the blood and make antibodies if a person is re-exposed to the coronavirus. Such cells may produce antibodies that can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus&quot;&gt;bind to mutated viruses&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts still don’t know what metrics, such as antibody levels in the blood, signal if a person is protected from the coronavirus. That makes it hard to tell from experiments done with lab-grown cells whether low levels of neutralizing antibodies are enough to stop an infection in a person or protect them from developing severe COVID-19, says Stuart Ray, a virologist and infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vaccine makers’ response&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the preliminary results hint at some trouble for vaccines, there’s not yet enough evidence to push scientists to begin giving people updated shots. For that, “I think we’d need to see evidence of reinfections in people who had well demonstrated immune responses” to the coronavirus, Ray says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it did come to that point, some types of vaccines could be easier to update than others. A new version of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s could be made in the lab in a few days, says John Mascola, director of the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center at NIAID. Moderna announced January 25 that the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against&quot;&gt;plans to run clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to test whether vaccinated people could get a third dose of its vaccine. Moderna is also planning to test a booster shot that uses a protein from the coronavirus variant in South Africa. Pfizer has said that the company is laying the groundwork to tweak its vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other vaccines, like AstraZeneca’s or Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective&quot;&gt;need to be produced in lab-grown cells&lt;/a&gt;, which could take a few weeks (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/23/20&lt;/em&gt;). Companies would then need to ramp up manufacturing for millions of doses, which takes time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But one complication is how regulatory agencies like the FDA might want to test updated vaccines tweaked to target new coronavirus variants. So far, that is unclear. If experts learn what immune system signals correlate with immunity in ongoing clinical trials, new vaccines might be tested in tens or hundreds of people — as agencies already do for updated influenza vaccines — rather than tens of thousands. But for now, Mascola says, “it is uncharted territory.” &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: ‘Fundamentals’ shows how reality is built from a few basic ingredients</title>

	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-fundamentals-book-how-reality-built-few-basic-ingredients</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3qXyyE7&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fundamentals book cover&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095695&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/013021_reviews_cover-122x186.jpg&quot; width=&quot;122&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3qXyyE7&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frank Wilczek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Penguin Press, $26&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the story is usually told, science began when some deep thinkers in ancient Greece decided to reject the popular mythological explanations for various natural phenomena. Those early philosophers sought logical explanations for things like thunderstorms, rather than attributing them to Zeus throwing temper tantrums in the form of thunderbolts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But early Greek scientific philosophy was not merely about replacing myth with logic. For the Greeks, explaining reality did not mean just devising a logical reason for each natural phenomenon in isolation — it was also about seeking a deep, coherent explanation for everything. And that meant identifying fundamental principles that explained a diversity of phenomena, encompassing the totality of physical reality. That’s the essence of science.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Science today is vastly more advanced, accurate and complex than it was in ancient times. Nevertheless, all of today’s sophisticated knowledge of physical reality is also rooted in a few fundamental principles, which physics Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek attempts to identify and explain in his latest book, &lt;em&gt;Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilczek’s fundamentals are framed as the “fundamental lessons we can learn from the study of the physical world,” as expressed by “the central messages of modern physics.” Each chapter assesses one of the “broad principles” he regards as fundamental. He explains their role in modern physical understanding and relates them to “how we humans fit into the big picture.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He divides his account into two main parts: “What there is” and “Beginnings and ends.” He describes the fundamentals he identifies from the perspective of two themes: “abundance” and “born again.” (He does not mean “born again” in a religious sense, but rather as an expression of the need to realize that the view of the world based on ordinary human experience does not conform to the underlying reality that modern science reveals. As adults, we must be “born again,” without preconceptions formed in childhood, to appreciate the actual fundamentals of reality.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What there is, Wilczek avers, includes plenty of space and plenty of time. Space, for instance, is vast no matter which way we look — compared with the universe, people are tiny; compared with the atom, people are huge. Similarly, the universe has existed for a very long time and has an even longer future ahead of it. Additional ingredients of this vast cosmos ultimately consist of a handful of subatomic particles, or more precisely, quantum fields responsible for those particles. And their behavior is governed by a small set of physical laws, as codified in the equations of general relativity and physicists’ “standard model” of particles and forces. Those ingredients, though limited in type, exist in abundant quantities. And the supply of energy in the cosmos needed to cook those ingredients into complex things is immense: A single star (the sun) emits thousands of times more than the total annual energy consumption of the Earth’s entire population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilczek describes how all those ingredients came to be in the form we see today in his “Beginnings and ends” chapters. A key part of the story is the emergence of complexity despite the simplicity of the fundamentals — the very few ingredients governed by very few laws. It turns out that tiny differences in the distribution of the ingredients lead to a diversity of structure and composition found on all scales throughout the cosmos. Gas clouds in space that differ only slightly, for example, “can yield systems of stars and planets that differ drastically.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key idea is Wilczek’s final fundamental, the physicist Niels Bohr’s principle of complementarity. Understanding the world requires the mind-expanding realization that one thing viewed “from different perspectives, can seem to have very different or even contradictory properties.” And that is why “the world is simple and complex, logical and weird, lawful and chaotic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals is an engaging account of the history of humankind’s understanding of reality, told by one of the key contributors to recent parts of that story. Wilczek’s grasp on the physics he relates is comprehensive and authoritative; he conveys technicalities with a rare combination of accuracy and accessibility. He is a little sketchy on some of his history, though. He gives an incorrect date for the Geiger-Marsden experiment leading to the discovery of the atomic nucleus, for example. Also, Einstein did not base his original proposal of photons on Max Planck’s work, and Wolfgang Pauli did not say the neutrino could not be observed in the letter wherein he originally proposed it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such quibbles aside, Wilczek provides an exceptionally clear guide to the state of physical knowledge in the early 21st century, much in the spirit of the sort of explanation that the ancient Greeks desired. Of course, as Wilczek emphasizes, the story is not nearly over. Perhaps a century or more from now, someone else will have to take up the task again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do understand many aspects of the physical world very deeply,” Wilczek writes. Yet “our understanding of the physical world is still growing and changing. It is a living thing.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knitting thick yarn is exponentially quicker than thin yarn, so I am already approaching done. Gunhild is knitted, steek-ed, and has edgings – just a soak, then blocking (persuading the knit fabric to reach its final intended shape).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was one major setback on the way – I ran out of the main colour yarn after adding some much needed bust space. And so, it turns out, had every yarn store on the continent. That particular burnt orange nuance was backlisted months in 50 different yarn stores. I should in retrospect of course have gotten an extra ball of yarn of each color; I only got an extra ball of the gray contrast yarn. So this Gunhild is unique, with contrast coloured half sleeves, and slightly different edging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How one physicist is unraveling the mathematics of knitting</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095649</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-one-physicist-unraveling-mathematics-knitting</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physicist Elisabetta Matsumoto is an avid knitter and has been since taking up the hobby as a child. During graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, Matsumoto came across an unusually knotty stitch while knitting a pattern for a Japanese red dragon. “I have books with thousands of different stitch patterns, but the one in the red dragon wall hanging was one I had never seen,” she says. That got her thinking about the geometry of stitches and, eventually, led her to study the mathematics of knitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a hundred or so basic stitches, Matsumoto says. By varying stitch combinations, a knitter can alter the elasticity, mechanical strength and 3-D structure of the resulting fabric. Yarn on its own isn’t very elastic. But when knitted, the yarn gives rise to fabric that can stretch by more than twice its length while the yarn itself barely stretches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto, now at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, is teasing out the mathematical rules that dictate how stitches impart such unique properties to fabrics. She hopes to develop a catalog of stitch types, their combinations and the resulting fabric properties. Knitters, scientists and manufacturers could all benefit from a dictionary of knits, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Elisabetta Matsumoto&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095664&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/012121_lc_knitting-math_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095664&quot;&gt;Elisabetta Matsumoto, a physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, hopes to create a dictionary of knits that could be used to manipulate physical properties of materials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095664&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Elisabetta Matsumoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto’s research builds on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unknotting-knot-theory&quot;&gt;knot theory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/31/08&lt;/em&gt;), a set of mathematical principles that define how knots form. These principles have helped explain how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/detangling-dna&quot;&gt;DNA folds and unfolds&lt;/a&gt; and how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/molecules-knots-periodic-table&quot;&gt;molecule’s makeup&lt;/a&gt; and distribution in space impart it with physical and chemical characteristics (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/23/08; SN: 8/27/18&lt;/em&gt;). Matsumoto is using knot theory to understand how each stitch entangles with its neighbors. “The types of stitches, the differences in their geometries as well as the order in which you put those stitches together into a textile may determine [the fabric’s] properties,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making tiny changes, such as altering a couple of crossings in a knot, could have &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2020/bridges2020-103.html&quot;&gt;a huge impact on the mechanics of the textile&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a fabric made of just one stitch type, such as a knit or purl, tends to curl at the edges. But combine the two stitch types together in alternating rows or columns, and the fabric lays flat. And despite looking nearly identical, the fabrics have varying degrees of stretchiness, Matsumoto and grad student Shashank Markande reported in July in the &lt;em&gt;Bridges 2020 Conference Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto’s team is now training a computer to think like a knitter. Using yarn properties, mathematical stitch details and final knitted structures as inputs, a program can predict mechanical properties of fabrics. These predictions could someday help tailor materials for specific applications — from scaffolds for growing human tissue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry&quot;&gt;wearable smart clothing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/1/18&lt;/em&gt;) — and perhaps solve knotty problems of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: US Politicians Use Moral Language More Often When They Have Less Power</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41228</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/26/us-politicians-use-moral-language-more-often-when-they-have-less-power/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever your political affiliation, making appeals to people’s morality can be a powerful rhetorical tool. Politicians frequently use language that refers to moral principles of harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity, in order to defend policy positions, appeal to new voters and appease old ones. And it’s an approach that seems to work. Research suggests that people are far more likely to take action once they connect a particular issue with their own moral or ethical convictions — even to the point of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00254.x&quot;&gt;committing acts of violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how and when politicians use moral language shifts with changes in the political landscape, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Toronto’s Sze-Yuh Nina Wang and Yoel Inbar, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at Democrat and Republican politicians in the US, they found that moral language increased as political power &lt;em&gt;decreased, &lt;/em&gt;suggesting that its use is not fixed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41228&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study looked at public tweets posted by members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; some, like Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, had millions of followers, while others had thousands. Using a text-analysis technique, the team coded nearly 700,000 tweets posted between January 2016 and January 2018 from 578 politicians in Congress (385,206 from Democrats and 302,154 from Republicans).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team focused on five moral foundations — harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity — and their positive and negative aspects (“virtues” and “vices”). For the analysis, the tweets were compared to a dictionary containing words related to each virtue and vice, to see how close the language in each tweet was to these words. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, Democrats used moral language more frequently than Republicans. And while moral language was used more by both parties after the 2016 Presidential election, this increase was greater for Democrats, who were more likely to go on using moral language. This was also the case for those moral foundations more traditionally associated with Republicans (loyalty, authority and purity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at transcripts of all debates and proceedings in Congress between 1981 and 2017, utilising the same text-analysis technique as in the first study. In both the House and the Senate, the minority party was far more likely to use moral language related to almost all of the foundations (a notable exception was language related to authority, which was sometimes used more frequently by the majority party).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the use of moral language is dynamic rather than static, and likely to change over time depending on context. This makes sense — moral language is often ramped up during national crises, perhaps because there is more at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at what subjects are being discussed using moral language — is it being used on specific issues, or more broadly to condemn the opposing party? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; is using such language also seems relevant. There are a huge range of divergent views even within a political party itself — a left wing politician like Bernie Sanders or Ilhan Omar is unlikely to share the exact moral values of the more centrist Nancy Pelosi, for example, even though they all belong to the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;Moral-Language Use by U.S. Political Elites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Crushed space rocks hint at exoplanets’ early atmospheric makeup</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095624</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crushed-space-rocks-meteorites-exoplanets-early-atmosphere</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Burning bits of ground-up meteorites may tell scientists what exoplanets’ early atmospheres are made of.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9243/presentation/1574&quot;&gt;experiments baking the pulverized space rocks&lt;/a&gt; suggests that rocky planets had early atmospheres full of water, astrophysicist Maggie Thompson of the University of California, Santa Cruz reported January 15 at the virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The air could also have had carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of hydrogen gas and hydrogen sulfide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets orbiting other stars. Like the terrestrial planets in the solar system, many could have rocky surfaces beneath thin atmospheres. Existing and future space telescopes can peek at starlight filtering through those exoplanets’ atmospheres to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets&quot;&gt;figure out what chemicals they contain&lt;/a&gt;, and if any are hospitable to life (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/19/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thompson and her colleagues are taking a different approach, working from the ground up. Instead of looking at the atmospheres themselves, she’s examining the rocky &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite&quot;&gt;building blocks of planets&lt;/a&gt; to see what kind of atmospheres they can create (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected small samples, about three milligrams per experiment, of three different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-planet-building-blocks-more-water-once-thought&quot;&gt;carbonaceous chondrite meteorites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/27/20&lt;/em&gt;). These rocks are the first solids that condensed out of the disk of dust and gas that surrounded the young sun and ultimately formed the planets, scientists say. The meteorites form “a record of the original components that formed planetesimals and planets in our solar system,” Thompson said in a talk at the AAS meeting. Exoplanets probably formed from similar stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers ground the meteorites to powder, then heated the powder in a special furnace hooked up to a mass spectrometer that can detect trace amounts of different gases. As the powder warmed, the researchers could measure how much of each gas escaped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That setup is analogous to how rocky planets formed their initial atmospheres after they solidified billions of years ago. Planets heated their original rocks with the decay of radioactive elements, collisions with asteroids or other planets, and with the leftover heat of their own formation. The warmed rocks let off gas. “Measuring the outgassing composition from meteorites can provide a range of atmospheric compositions for rocky exoplanets,” Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three meteorites mostly let off water vapor, which accounted for 62 percent of the gas emitted on average. The next most common gases were carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, followed by hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide and some more complex gases that this early version of the experiment didn’t identify. Thompson says she hopes to identify those gases in future experimental runs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results indicate astronomers should expect water-rich steam atmospheres around young rocky exoplanets, at least as a first approximation. “In reality, the situation will be far more complicated,” Thompson said. Planets can be made of other kinds of rocks that would contribute other gases to their atmospheres, and geologic activity changes a planet’s atmosphere over time. After all, Earth’s breathable atmosphere is very different from Mars’ thin, carbon dioxide-rich air or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life&quot;&gt;Venus’s thick, hot, sulfurous soup&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/14/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “this experimental framework takes an important step forward to connect rocky planet interiors and their early atmospheres,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This sort of basic research is useful because it “has put a quantitative compositional framework on what those planets might have looked like as they evolved,” says planetary scientist Kat Gardner-Vandy of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, who was not involved in this new work. She studies meteorites too and is often asked whether experiments that crush the ancient, rare rocks are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People inevitably will ask me, ‘Why would you take a piece of a meteorite and then ruin it?’” she says. “New knowledge from the study of meteorites is just as priceless as the meteorite itself.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: A robot arm toting a Venus flytrap can grab delicate objects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095630</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-arm-venus-flytrap-can-grab-delicate-objects</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new robotic grabber is ripped straight from the plant world. The device, made with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-00530-4&quot;&gt;severed piece of a Venus flytrap&lt;/a&gt;, can grasp tiny, delicate objects, researchers report January 25 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Electronics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, the carnivorous &lt;em&gt;Dionaea muscipula&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-venus-flytraps-store-short-term-memories-prey&quot;&gt;scores a meal&lt;/a&gt; when unsuspecting prey touches delicate hairs on one of the plant’s jawlike leaves, triggering the trap to snap shut (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/14/20&lt;/em&gt;). But by sticking electrodes to the leaves and applying a small electric voltage, researchers designed a method to force Venus flytraps to close. Even when cut from the plant, the leaves retained the ability to shut upon command for up to a day, say materials scientist Wenlong Li and colleagues at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrating soft, flexible plant material into robotics could aid in picking up fragile objects that would otherwise be damaged by clunky, rigid graspers, the researchers say. So, Li’s team attached a piece of a flytrap to a robotic arm and used a smartphone app to control the trap. In experiments, the robotic grabber clutched a piece of wire one-half of a millimeter in diameter. And when not strapped to the robotic arm, the dismembered plant also caught a slowly moving 1-gram weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One drawback: The traps take hours to reopen, meaning this bot had better make the catch on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Scientists controlled a Venus flytrap outfitted with electrodes, using a smartphone to direct it to grasp small objects like a wire and a moving weight.&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

In December 2020, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0427_EN.html&quot;&gt;EU warned that the human rights situation in Egypt had deteriorated sharply&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, citing the arbitrary detainment of 4,000 citizens, imprisonment of 60,000 people on political grounds, the systematic enforced disappearance of political opponents, grave violations to the right to  life, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, could we expect new mass protests to mark the ten-year anniversary of the Arab Spring? Based on interviews with participants and non-participants in the 2011 Egyptian and Moroccan uprisings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://t.co/Sd3yRjdUoi?amp=1&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; investigates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/data.php&quot;&gt;cognitive processes&lt;/a&gt; underlying the protests. The findings show that individuals joined the uprisings based on hot, positive emotions, which translated into protest decision with great speed. In contrast, decisions to stay at home were based on slow and cool reasoning processes focused on individual safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety considerations were so strong that they encouraged large numbers of people to abstain from the Arab Spring even if individuals approved of the protests and rejected the ruling regime. In the words of a non-participant: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/files/cogs.12762.pdf&quot;&gt;When people are killed, we must be careful. There are more important things than protest: safety and stability&lt;/a&gt;.” On the other hand, positive emotions of courage to face the government, hope that protest would succeed, solidarity with other protestors, and national pride were major contributors to the Arab Spring. These emotions were themselves triggered by the successful mass uprisings in Tunisia, unprecedented numbers of protest at home, and fellow citizens sacrificing their lives to face violent state authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current situation does not display these emotional triggers, but countless grounds for safety concerns. Nevertheless, hot cognition and emotion-based reasoning &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557&quot;&gt;happen fast&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers have observed that mass protests take off very suddenly, so that they “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~public.econ.duke.edu/~tk43/abstracts/articles/ab_article_18A.htm&quot;&gt;will unavoidably continue to catch the world by surprise&lt;/a&gt;.” When Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, nobody would have anticipated the subsequent Arab Spring. Similar triggers will occur in the Arab world, with the potential of translating into new uprisings. In the words of a Moroccan participant of the Arab Spring: “I am convinced that totalitarianism will disappear. For me it is not a question if that will happen, but how that will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tahrir_Square_-_February_9,_2011.png&quot;&gt;Tahrir Square&lt;/a&gt;, by Jonathan Rashad (CC BY 2.0)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/&quot;&gt;Safety first?

	<title>Science News: How much will Africa capitalize on cheap renewable energy as its power grid grows?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095599</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-growing-power-grid-cheap-renewable-energy-fuel-emissions</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Africa’s electricity capacity is expected to double by 2030 — and with the rapidly dropping cost of renewable energy technologies, the continent might seem poised to go green. But a new analysis suggests that fossil fuels will still dominate Africa’s energy mix over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists used a machine learning approach that analyzes what characteristics, such as fuel type and financing, controlled the past successes and failures of power plants across the continent. Their findings suggest that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-00755-9&quot;&gt;will make up less than 10 percent of Africa’s total electrical power&lt;/a&gt; generation by 2030, the team reports January 11 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015, 195 nations pledged to reduce their fossil fuel emissions to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. To achieve that goal, the world would have to reduce its emissions by 2.7 percent each year from 2020 to 2030 — but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions&quot;&gt;current pledges are nowhere near enough to achieve that target&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/26/19&lt;/em&gt;). And the energy demand from developing economies, including many on the African continent, is expected to increase dramatically by 2030 — possibly leading to even more fossil fuel emissions over the next decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the price of renewable energy technologies, particularly wind and solar energy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_Chapter4_Low_Res.pdf&quot;&gt;has rapidly dropped over the last few years&lt;/a&gt;. So many scientists and activists have said they hope that African countries might be able to take advantage of these technologies, leapfrogging past carbon-intensive coal or oil-based energy growth and straight into building renewable energy plants.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Whether that’s a realistic scenario hasn’t been clear, says Galina Alova, a sustainability scientist at the University of Oxford. There is a lot of uncertainty about how and why new and planned energy projects might succeed or fail on the continent, she says. “We wanted to understand whether Africa is actually heading in the direction of making that decisive leap, but we wanted to do it looking at the data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Alova, along with Oxford sustainability scientists Philipp Trotter and Alex Money, amassed data on nearly 3,000 energy projects — both fossil-fuel based and renewable — that were commissioned over the last 20 years across Africa’s 54 countries. Those projects included both successful and failed energy plants. The data include a variety of characteristics for the different plants, such as how much energy a particular plant can produce, what type of fuel it uses, how well it’s connected to an energy grid, who owns the plant and how it’s financed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, the team used a machine learning approach creating a computer algorithm to identify which of these characteristics were the best predictors of success in the past. Finally, the scientists analyzed the chances for success of almost 2,500 projects now in the pipeline, based on those features as well as on different country characteristics, such as the strength of the economy, population density and political stability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those country-level factors do matter, but they weren’t the biggest predictors of a project’s success, Trotter says. “We do see some truth to good governance, but project-level [factors have] been consistently more important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those factors include the power plants’ size and whether the plants had public or private financing, for example. Smaller renewable energy plants tended to have a better chance of success than larger projects, as did plants with financing from large public funders, such as the World Bank, which are less likely to pull out in the face of delays or roadblocks. As for fuel type, there has been a recent uptick in the chances for success for solar energy in particular, the team found — but overall, oil and gas projects still have a much greater chance to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this adds up to, the team found, is that by 2030, fossil fuels will still account for two-thirds of all energy generation on the continent. Renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, will account for less than 10 percent, with the remainder, about 18 percent of the power mix, coming primarily from hydro-electric power.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixed fuels  &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New power plants will roughly double the African continent’s total electricity capacity — the maximum possible energy that all of the plants could generate if running under ideal conditions — over the next decade, increasing from about 244 gigawatts in 2019 to 472 gigawatts in 2030, according to a new study. Predicted capacity in 2030 is based on how many new plants are in the pipeline minus those that will be retired by 2030 as well as those that the study predicts are likely to fail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of October 2019, wind and solar energy capacity was only about 4 percent. By 2030, 17 percent of the energy capacity will come from wind and solar power — though actual power generation from these renewables is expected to produce less than 10 percent of the continent’s electricity. Meanwhile, 62 percent of the energy capacity will come from fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, and another 17 percent from hydroelectric power. Other planned energy sources include biomass and geothermal technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were “both quite surprising and unsurprising to me,” says Wikus Kruger, a researcher in the African power sector at the University of Cape Town in South Africa who was not involved in the new study. The finding that project-level factors, particularly financing, are very significant tracks with research he and others have done, he says. But, he says, he is less convinced that the decreasing cost of renewables won’t be a bigger factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing this massive disruption [to the energy market], in terms of costs of renewables. It’s just completely changed the way that planning is done. What’s exciting about this disruptive moment is that these smaller renewable energy projects are in conflict states that have historically struggled to get anything done,” Kruger says. “But these are smaller, more modular projects, and people are willing to put smaller amounts [of money] into projects that spread the risks out across a wide variety of countries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One other factor that could change the renewable energy outlook, Alova says, is if many of the fossil fuel plants now in the pipeline were to be canceled, what the team calls a “rapid decarbonization shock.” But that wouldn’t occur just due to a drop in the cost of renewable energy technologies alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increasing the share of renewable energy in Africa’s electricity mix “will not happen automatically by some invisible hand,” Trotter says. “It’s something that has to happen from the top, from African governments and the international development community.” The danger, he says, is that once a fossil fuel power plant enters production, it will stay in operation for 20 or 30 years, “so it’s really important not to be locked into these. What is clear from our dataset is that we have to act now [to cancel those fossil fuel plants]; this is not something we can postpone any longer.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Why Do Basketball Teams Have a Home-Court Advantage? Natural Experiment During Pandemic Provides Some Answers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41223</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/25/why-do-basketball-teams-have-a-home-court-advantage-natural-experiment-during-pandemic-provides-some-answers/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the US National Basketball Association (NBA) was forced to pause the season due to Covid-19 on March 11 last year, the fans were naturally devastated. When the season resumed five months later, with the top 22 teams bubbled together and playing every game in Orlando, Florida, this was great news for the sport, and the fans — and a pair of US researchers. Andrew McHill at Oregon Health and Science University and Evan Chinoy at Leidos Inc, in San Diego, realised that the restart provided a perfect natural experiment to explore the effects of travel on play. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2&quot;&gt;Their study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, reveals some insights into causes of the well-documented sporting home-side advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41223&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “home-court” advantage, as it’s known in basketball, is apparent in the results tables: teams win more often at home than away. In normal circumstances, it’s hard, though, to disentangle all the possible variables that might underlie it. These include home-crowd noise, the discomfort of air travel, and time zone changes. In regular seasons, NBA teams do regularly travel long distances across the US, through one, two or even three time zones, to play away games. Many NBA players report resulting sleep loss and fatigue, and harmful effects on their performance, recovery and mood, the researchers note. Disruption to circadian rhythms has been considered the mostly likely culprit, though the rigours of travel and sleeping away from home have also been highlighted as potentially play a role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore just how travel affects play, the researchers looked at the results of the 22 teams’ games before the pause, compared with their results while none were travelling and all were playing in one location, in Orlando. The pair also considered various aspects of the teams’ performances in each game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first portion of the season, teams won 63.8% of their home games, and 50.8 % of their away games. McHill and Chinoy found, though, that there was only a disadvantage to playing away when a team had to travel across time zones, and not when they played away within the same time zone (the detrimental effects of travelling across time zones mostly occurred when teams travelled westwards, rather than eastward). When the teams were later all playing in Florida, with no travel (and only virtual fans), though a “home” and “away” team was designated for each game, there was no “home” advantage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked more closely at various aspects of play. They found that when teams travelled across time zones, their shooting accuracy suffered. They also lost more possessions and scored fewer points per 100 possessions (indicating that they were playing more defensively). But even when a team played away and didn’t cross time zones, they played a more defensive game, and they got a lower percentage of the offensive rebounds (an event that gives the offensive team another opportunity to score).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McHill and Chinoy also found that when the teams did not travel, while bubbled, the typical home-court advantages for shooting accuracy and rebounding were reduced. “Thus, home-court advantage in professional basketball appears to be linked with the away team’s impaired shooting accuracy and rebounding,” the pair writes. They add that these “may be separately influenced by either circadian disruption or the general effect of travel, as these differences manifest differently when teams travel within or across multiple time zones.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Athletes in other major sports, including baseball, also travel regularly across time zones. If basketball shooting accuracy is taken as a measure of movement precision, and this is worsened by such travel, this could help to explain the home-side advantage — or the away-side disadvantage — in these sports, too. As the researchers also note: “Future work is needed to explore other athletic events where travel schedules can impact performance to further elucidate travel and circadian factors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2&quot;&gt;Utilizing the National Basketball Association’s COVID-19 restart “bubble” to uncover the impact of travel and circadian disruption on athletic performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A new orange and black bat species is always ready for Halloween</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095595</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-orange-black-bat-species-halloween-africa-echolocation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bats, better known for their mousy looks, can have a colorful side. A new species, discovered when two bats were caught at an abandoned miners’ tunnel in western Africa, sports showy swathes of orange fur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new finds “are just gorgeous,” says mammalogist Nancy Simmons of the National Museum of Natural History in New York City. Orange fur on the bats’ backs contrasts with black sections of wing membranes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what sets this bat apart: Three other &lt;em&gt;Myotis&lt;/em&gt; species from the continent are similarly flashy. Rather less visible traits, from details of hidden striping in its fur to its echolocation calls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2020/issue-3963/3963.1/A-New-Dichromatic-Species-of-Myotis-Chiroptera--Vespertilionidae-from/10.1206/3963.1.short&quot;&gt;peg &lt;em&gt;Myotis nimbaensis &lt;/em&gt;as something unusual&lt;/a&gt;, Simmons and colleagues report online January 13 in &lt;em&gt;American Museum Novitates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new species was discovered the old-fashioned way — out in a remote forest at night with keen eyes studying real animals. That’s not so common nowadays in the age of sensitive genetic tools, Simmons says. Many of the 20 or so new bat species typically named every year are detected through genetic analyses of museum specimen lookalikes. &lt;em&gt;M. nimbaensis &lt;/em&gt;differs genetically from near kin — about as much as humans differ from gorillas. Differences also show up in teeth as well as other anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But when researchers collected the first bat, near the mouth of an abandoned tunnel for mineral exploration up in Guinea’s section of the Nimba Mountains, the flashy beast wasn’t obviously anything new. While most of the more than 1,400 known kinds of bats are various shades of brown, bats here and there around the world can be yellow, fluffball white or coppery red. And there was the matter of the three other orange &lt;em&gt;Myotis &lt;/em&gt;species. (How, or whether, the colors matter in animals active at night, Simmons says, is “one of the mysteries.”)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One way to tell the new species apart is from the proportions of secret stripes on the individual hairs in orange fur patches. In the newly named bats, the bottom third of each orange hair is black. Then comes a creamy white middle third before the hair turns pumpkin at the tip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers named &lt;em&gt;M. nimbaensis &lt;/em&gt;after its mountainous habitat. The Nimba Mountains shoot up abruptly from lowland forests, creating little “sky islands” of isolated habitat on peaks, says coauthor Eric Moïse Bakwo Fils, a bat specialist at the University of Maroua in Cameroon. &lt;em&gt;M. nimbaensis&lt;/em&gt; probably eats insects, judging by its interlocking triangular teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bakwo Fils worries about the fragility of sky islands and the newfound bats’ future. Small animals flitting in the dark rarely get the conservation attention that large charismatic African wildlife does. Yet we depend on various little half-seen bats streaking in the dark to catch insects, pollinate plants, spread seeds and help with other chores that keep our ecosystems going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Giant worms may have burrowed into the ancient seafloor to ambush prey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095608</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-bobbit-worms-burrow-fossils-seafloor-ambush-prey</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Around 20 million years ago, giant ocean worms may have burrowed into the seafloor and burst forth like the space slug from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to ambush unsuspecting fish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ancient underground lairs left behind by these animals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79311-0&quot;&gt;appear in rocks from coastal Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report January 21 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. The diggers may have been analogs of modern bobbit worms (&lt;em&gt;Eunice aphroditois&lt;/em&gt;), known for burying themselves in sand to surprise and strike their prey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The burrows are trace fossils — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-without-bones-gives-glimpse-long-gone-life&quot;&gt;evidence of animal activity preserved in the geologic record&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/15/14&lt;/em&gt;) such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caves-france-dinosaur-prints-paleontology&quot;&gt;footprints&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/27/20&lt;/em&gt;) or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shhhh-some-plant-eating-dinos-snacked-crunchy-critters&quot;&gt;fossilized poop&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/21/17&lt;/em&gt;). These newly reported fossils were first spotted in 2013 at Taiwan’s Badouzi promontory by paleontologist Masakazu Nara of Kochi University in Japan. More turned up later amid the otherworldly rock structures of Yehliu geopark, a popular tourist attraction that was once a shallow ocean ecosystem 20 million to 22 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From 319 fossil specimens, the team was able to reconstruct the burrows. The animals drilled L-shaped paths into the seafloor, leaving a funnel structure at the top that looks like a feather in vertical cross sections. The burrows were about 2 meters long and 2 to 3 centimeters wide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fossilized Pennichnus formosae burrow&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095610&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/012121_ht_giant-worms_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095610&quot;&gt;Fossilized &lt;em&gt;Pennichnus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;formosae&lt;/em&gt; burrows (one lower section pictured) were L-shaped probably because worms needed to stay close to the seafloor surface, where there would have been more oxygen available to breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095610&quot;&gt;Yu-Yen Pan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Compared to other trace fossils, which are usually only a few tens of centimeters long, this trace fossil was huge,” says Yu-Yen Pan, a geologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. She dubbed the trace fossil &lt;em&gt;Pennichnus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;formosae&lt;/em&gt;, combining the Latin words for feather, footprint and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The burrows were most likely dug by some kind of giant worm, the researchers conclude, because they lacked the hallmark pellets lining crustacean tunnels and had smoother lining than bivalve tunnels. Iron deposits along the inside suggest the digger must have been long and slender and used mucus to reinforce the walls. Funneling at the top of the burrow also points to the ancient worm emerging from its hideout, retreating and then rebuilding the top sections over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“These [funnels] suggest that the worm repeatedly dragged its prey down into the sediment,” says study coauthor Ludvig Löwemark, a geoscientist at National Taiwan University in Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These hunting tactics are consistent with those of modern bobbit worms, which conceal their 3-meter-long bodies in sand and surge forth to grab unsuspecting prey with scissorlike teeth. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43061&quot;&gt;oldest evidence&lt;/a&gt; of bobbit worms comes from the early Paleozoic Era, around 400 million years ago, how or if the ancient worms relate to bobbit worms is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Named for Lorena Bobbitt who was convicted of cutting off her husband’s penis in 1993, bobbit worms are found in coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. In this clip, a bobbit worm strikes an unsuspecting fish and retreats into its burrow.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the worms that lived in these ancient tunnels were invertebrates, they didn’t have skeletons to leave behind in the fossil record. If soft tissue or teeth from bobbit worms were found preserved inside a burrow, that would confirm that these animals were living in the area 20 million years ago. But teeth break easily, and soft tissue degrades. Both are unlikely to turn up in the fossil record, and that’s normal for trace fossils.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is almost always a challenge to link fossil traces to specific trace makers,” says David Rudkin, an invertebrate paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, who was not involved with this study. Still, Rudkin thinks that the case for ancient bobbit worms hiding in these burrows is convincing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If ancient bobbit worms did terrorize the seafloor back then, their burrows are a rare example of invertebrates hunting vertebrates — usually it’s the other way around. Their presence also makes the local ecosystem more complex than previously thought, says Löwemark. “There was obviously a whole lot more going on at the seafloor 20 million years ago than one would imagine when seeing these sandstones,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans process and recognise faces as a whole, rather than by examining individual features&lt;/strong&gt;. Now new work suggests that some species of wasp also process faces in this “holistic” fashion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/humans-wasps-seem-recognize-faces-more-sum-their-parts&quot;&gt;reports Cathleen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. Golden paper wasps were better at recognising other wasps when shown pictures of the whole face rather than just part of it, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41206&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we lie to someone, we may end up mimicking their body language. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s according to a study in which participants cheated while solving a puzzle, and then either told the truth or lied about their cheating to another participant. When the participant lied, pairs’ movements were more similar than when the participant told the truth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264607-lying-makes-us-mimic-the-body-language-of-the-people-we-are-talking-to/&quot;&gt;reports Christa Lesté-Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the past year, have you found yourself endlessly scrolling through social media as the world falls apart? &lt;/strong&gt;If so, you’re not alone — “doomscrolling” seems to be pretty common. At &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Shambles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicshambles.com/words/blogs/deanburnett/doomscrolling&quot;&gt;Dean Burnett explains&lt;/a&gt; just why this seemingly stressful activity is so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation might help to alleviate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;reports Diana Kwon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that transcranial alternating current stimulation delivered over the brain’s orbitofrontal cortex reduced compulsive behaviours in people who had OCD symptoms. But it remains to be seen whether similar results are found in people with a formal OCD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out across the country — but can we also inoculate people against misinformation about the virus? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/covid-19-misinformation-scientists-create-a-psychological-vaccine-to-protect-against-fake-news-153024&quot;&gt;Sander van der Linden and Jon Roozenbeek explain their approach&lt;/a&gt; to proactively protecting people from fake news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenagers “catch” moods from their peers — and this is particularly the case for bad moods, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/20/teenagers-can-catch-moods-from-friends-study-finds&quot;&gt;reports Sally Weale&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. To figure out how moods were transmitted within teens’ social networks, researchers asked young musicians to keep diaries of their mood and social interactions during concert tours. The team also found the participants’ popularity wasn’t related to their mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The storming of the US Capitol earlier this month marked the low point of a troubling few months in American politics. &lt;/strong&gt;But what can psychology tell us about the factors involved in this kind of “mass mobilisation” — and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/what-psychology-of-mass-mobilization-can-tell-us-about-the-capitol-riot/&quot;&gt;Jennifer Ouellette takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2021/01/22/upcoming-january-meetings-for-the-nih-brain-initiative-neuroethics-and-multi-council-working-groups/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please join us for two virtual NIH BRAIN Initiative meetings on Tuesday, January 26, 2021 and Wednesday, January 27, 2021. Videocast will be available for the BRAIN Neuroethics Working Group meeting and for the open session of the BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2983&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroethics Working Group meeting – Tuesday, January 26, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;Neuroethics Working Group (NEWG)&lt;/a&gt; will hold its eleventh meeting. Input from members of the NEWG helps to ensure that neuroethics is fully integrated into the BRAIN Initiative. The meeting will feature a presentation on emerging ethics themes within BRAIN by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioethics.nih.gov/people/hendriks-bio.shtml&quot;&gt;Dr. Saskia Hendriks&lt;/a&gt; from the NIH Department of Bioethics. Then, the group will discuss plans for potential neuroethics workshops on several topics, including neural data privacy, ensuring inclusivity, and others. Lastly, in the context of existing themes within the BRAIN portfolio and potential emerging neuroethics topics of interest, the NEWG will revisit themes outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-and-neuroethics-enabling-and-enhancing&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 neuroethics report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will take place from &lt;strong&gt;12:00 PM – 3:20 PM (ET)&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone can tune in live via &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=40155&quot;&gt;videocast&lt;/a&gt;. For more details, please view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;NEWG webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Council Working Group meeting – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, January 27, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group&quot;&gt;Multi-Council Working Group (MCWG)&lt;/a&gt; will convene its eighteenth meeting to discuss the current state of BRAIN and the Initiative’s future. The meeting will feature updates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/About-NINDS/Who-We-Are/staff/John-Ngai&quot;&gt;Dr. John Ngai&lt;/a&gt;, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director, and a presentation on training, inclusion, and equity (TIE) efforts by Drs. Jay Churchill and Michelle Jones-London. There will be a presentation on approaches to diversifying the scientific workforce by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/staff/bernard-marie&quot;&gt;Dr. Marie Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversity.nih.gov/about-us&quot;&gt;acting NIH Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a discussion on how the BRAIN Initiative will continue to promote these efforts. Lastly, NIH staff will present two concepts for funding: (1) short courses on neuroscience skills development; and (2) projects for building infrastructure for reagent development, production, and use at minority-serving and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/DRCB/IDeA/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;IDeA&lt;/a&gt;-eligible institutions, which will expand upon a transformative project funding opportunity aimed to create “A Cell Type-Specific Armamentarium for Understanding Brain Function and Dysfunction” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-20-556.html&quot;&gt;RFA-MH-20-556&lt;/a&gt;), as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 neuroscience report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: 50 years ago, scientists poked holes in the existence of polywater</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the sweat of their brow&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sweat-their-brow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, January 23, 1971&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polywater, or anomalous water, has provoked a continuing controversy among chemists. It is hard enough to believe that water can assume a form as viscous as molasses and have an atomic weight several times that of an ordinary molecule of water.… From the beginning, however, there were doubters, and as proponents of polywater failed more and more … in their attempts to produce convincingly large quantities of it, the doubters began to have their innings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polywater evaporated when scientists confirmed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/polywater-evaporates-insight-science&quot;&gt;impurities in ordinary water&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the strange properties (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/1/73, p. 133&lt;/em&gt;). In the decades since that debunking, physicists have continued puzzling over other H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O quirks. For instance, hot water appears to sometimes freeze faster than cold water — a phenomenon known as the Mpemba effect. A study of glass beads suggests that warm objects can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-new-experiment-hot-water-freeze-faster-cold-mpemba-effect&quot;&gt;take thermal shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; to reach the frozen finish line first (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/12/20, p. 16&lt;/em&gt;). The jury is still out on whether water, with all its complexity, behaves the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: The COVID-19 pandemic made U.S. college students’ mental health even worse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095550</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-us-college-students-mental-health</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has caused the mental health of U.S. college students to plummet, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Students most &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245327&quot;&gt;at risk of mental health challenges stemming from the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; include women, Asians, students under age 25, those in poor health, those who knew somebody with COVID-19 and lower-income students, researchers report January 7 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before the emergence of the novel coronavirus, U.S. college students struggled with depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders at higher rates than the general population. Many college students are grappling with a new social environment, struggling to figure out their careers and worrying about finances, says Matthew Browning, an environmental psychologist at Clemson University in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To assess how the pandemic is impacting student mental health, Browning and colleagues surveyed more than 2,500 students from seven public universities across the United States last spring when the pandemic was ramping up. Study participants ranked statements about their emotional state, preoccupation with COVID-19, stress and time use. Based on total scores, researchers classified the students as having experienced high, moderate or low levels of emotional distress and worry. The researchers note that they did not use standardized screening tools for disorders such as anxiety and depression, but instead zoomed in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-psychological-fallout&quot;&gt;mental health stressors arising directly from the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/29/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;About 85 percent of the students surveyed experienced high to moderate levels of distress, Browning’s team found — about 45 percent were highly impacted and about 40 percent were moderately impacted. Those who reported low levels of distress were more likely to be white and spend two or more hours outdoors.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain factors put some students at greater risk of feeling highly distressed. Women were twice as likely to fall into that group, versus the moderate or low groups, while Asians were 30 percent more likely. Spending eight or more hours in front of computer, smartphone or television screens also increased risk.    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colleges and universities must meet students’ basic safety and psychological needs before true learning can occur, Browning says. “We need to address students’ mental well-being before we think about the best way to deliver online classes during COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Space station detectors found the source of weird ‘blue jet’ lightning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095581</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-station-detectors-found-source-weird-blue-jet-lightning</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have finally gotten a clear view of the spark that sets off an exotic type of lightning called a blue jet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blue jets zip upward from thunderclouds into the stratosphere, reaching altitudes up to about 50 kilometers in less than a second. Whereas ordinary lightning excites a medley of gases in the lower atmosphere to glow white, blue jets excite mostly stratospheric nitrogen to create their signature blue hue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blue jets have been observed from the ground and aircraft for years, but it’s hard to tell how they form without getting high above the clouds. Now, instruments on the International Space Station have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03122-6&quot;&gt;spotted a blue jet emerge&lt;/a&gt; from an extremely brief, bright burst of electricity near the top of a thundercloud, researchers report online January 20 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding blue jets and other upper-atmosphere phenomena related to thunderstorms, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/importance-being-electric&quot;&gt;sprites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/14/02&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/glowing-doughnuts-flash-high-above-storms&quot;&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/23/95&lt;/em&gt;), is important because these events can affect how radio waves travel through the air — potentially impacting communication technologies, says Penn State space physicist Victor Pasko, who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cameras and light-sensing instruments called photometers on the space station observed the blue jet in a storm over the Pacific Ocean, near the island of Nauru, in February 2019. “The whole thing starts with what I think of as a blue bang,” says Torsten Neubert, an atmospheric physicist at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. That “blue bang” was a 10-microsecond flash of bright blue light near the top of the cloud, about 16 kilometers high. From that flashpoint, a blue jet shot up into the stratosphere, climbing as high as about 52 kilometers over several hundred milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spark that generated the blue jet may have been a special kind of short-range electric discharge inside the thundercloud, Neubert says. Normal lightning bolts are formed by discharges between oppositely charged regions of a cloud — or a cloud and the ground — many kilometers apart. But turbulent mixing high in a cloud may bring oppositely charged regions within about a kilometer of each other, creating very short but powerful bursts of electric current, Neubert says. Researchers have seen evidence of such high-energy, short-range discharges in pulses of radio waves from thunderstorms detected by ground-based antennas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and the Big Ten Academic Alliance Announce Publishing Deal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18626</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/XZpljA2M98A/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for BTAA members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program. The agreement ensures time to test and evaluate this new community-based model and allows BTAA researchers to publish in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; without incurring fees. The BTAA and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA is the largest consortium globally to participate in both CAP communities, meaning that every member has committed to the full three-year pilot. As some of the largest research institutions in the world and major contributors to both journals, the BTAA commitment ensures this new collective action-based model kicks off with a strong foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance members are: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Rutgers University–New Brunswick, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Maryland–College Park, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Chicago. PLOS has extended the benefits of this agreement to include most system, regional, and branch campuses of these universities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Big Ten Academic Alliance’s commitment to this community-driven model demonstrates the power of collectives to transform scholarly publishing. This collaboration has been a partnership from the beginning and BTAA’s members and administration have been vital in helping us build and execute on this new experiment in sustainable highly selective publishing.” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maurice York, BTAA’s Director of Library Initiatives, adds: “One of the key strategic questions in front of us is how to advance the growth of open science and open scholarship through collective and intentional action. We are actively seeking pathways to create a sustainable, scalable open knowledge ecosystem for our researchers and scholars. We are pleased to join together with PLOS to take up this pilot in common cause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS in 2020, following other agreements with the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/&quot;&gt;among others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/01/plos-and-the-big-ten-academic-alliance-announce-publishing-deal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PLOS and the Big Ten Academic Alliance Announce Publishing Deal&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Official PLOS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Episode 23 of PsychCrunch&lt;/strong&gt;, the podcast from the British Psychological Society’s &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;. Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/psychcrunch/PsychCrunch_Ep23.mp3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Emily Reynolds, staff writer at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;, explores modern psychology’s relationship with race and representation. It’s well-known that psychology has a generalisability problem, with studies overwhelmingly using so-called “WEIRD” participants: those who are Western and educated and from industrialised, rich and democratic societies. But how does that shape the assumptions we make about participants of different racial identities or cultures? And how can top-tier psychology journals improve diversity among not only participants but also authors and editors?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=BKCHEON&amp;amp;CategoryDescription=psychology&quot;&gt;Dr Bobby Cheon&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccsre.stanford.edu/people/steven-o-roberts&quot;&gt;Dr Steven O.

	<title>Science News: The oldest known abrading tool was used around 350,000 years ago</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095542</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-abrading-tool-archaeology-tabun-cave</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A round stone excavated at Israel’s Tabun Cave in the 1960s represents the oldest known grinding or rubbing tool, say researchers who scrutinized the 350,000-year-old find.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The specimen marks a technological turn to manipulating objects with wide, flat stone surfaces, say Ron Shimelmitz, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa in Israel, and his colleagues. Up to that time, stone implements had featured thin points or sharp edges. Microscopic wear and polish on a worn section of the Tabun stone resulted from it having been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248420301706&quot;&gt;ground or rubbed against relatively soft material&lt;/a&gt;, such as animal hides or plants, the scientists conclude in the January &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar stones bearing signs of abrasion date to no more than around 200,000 years ago. Specific ways in which the Tabun stone was used remain a mystery. By around 50,000 years ago, though, human groups were using grinding stones to prepare plants and other foods, Shimelmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team compared microscopic damage on the Tabun stone to that produced in experiments with nine similar stones collected near the cave site. Archaeology students forcefully ran each of the nine stones back-and-forth for 20 minutes over different surfaces: hard basalt rock, wood of medium hardness or a soft deer hide. Those applied to deer hide displayed much in common with the business end of the ancient stone tool, including a wavy surface and clusters of shallow grooves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear which evolutionary relatives of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; — whose origins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim&quot;&gt;go back about 300,000 years&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/7/17&lt;/em&gt;) —made the Tabun tool, Shimelmitz says. Other innovations around the same time included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire&quot;&gt;regular fire use&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/12&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Explore every gravitational wave event spotted so far</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3094956</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo</link>
	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;Throughout the universe, violent collisions of cosmic beasts such as black holes wrench the fabric of spacetime, producing ripples called gravitational waves. For most of history, humans have been oblivious to those celestial rumbles. Today, we’ve detected scores of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first came in 2015, when scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, spotted gravitational waves spawned from the merger of two black holes. That event rattled the bones of the cosmos — shaking the underlying structure of space and time. The detection also stirred up astronomy, providing a new way to observe the universe, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction&quot;&gt;verified a prediction of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But like a lone ripple in a vast sea, a single detection can tell scientists only so much. Now, LIGO and its partner observatory Advanced Virgo have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14527&quot;&gt;collected 50 sets of gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these spacetime ripples resulted from two black holes spiraling inward before colliding. Some arose from collisions of dense stellar corpses called neutron stars. Two collisions involve celestial bodies that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object&quot;&gt;can’t be confidently identified&lt;/a&gt;, hinting that scientists may have spotted the first merger of a neutron star with a black hole (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/23/20&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;Every gravitational wave event detected to date, in one chart&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have spotted 50 collisions of massive objects out in space. Explore details of these smashups below.&lt;/p&gt;



	


&lt;p class=&quot;has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interactive illustration is best viewed in the most recent versions of all major web browsers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more distant a collision is from Earth, the longer it takes the gravitational waves to arrive. Some detected ripples were born when the universe was only about half its current age of 13.8 billion years. The less massive mergers in the collection tend to have happened in the more recent past; they are closer to Earth. That’s because smaller smashups are harder for LIGO and Virgo to see.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the 50 collisions left behind surprisingly large black holes, including the biggest known merger, which created the first definitive example of a class of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;medium-sized black holes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/2/20&lt;/em&gt;). The data also revealed that some black holes are rapidly spinning before they merge, and that mergers can occur between objects with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-unevenly-sized-black-holes-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;very different masses&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). That information could help scientists understand how pairs of black holes form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With so much data, there are plenty of questions to explore. Sets of gravitational waves have even been converted into the analogous sound waves, allowing for an aural appreciation of these enigmatic events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future detections will further illuminate the furtive movements of these mysterious objects. Welcome to a new era of astronomy in which black holes and neutron stars regularly communicate their secrets to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Biden administration outlines its ambitious plan to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095558</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-biden-administration-plan-response</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inauguration Day marks both a grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic and a new chapter in the U.S. response to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On January 19, the United States surpassed 400,000 coronavirus deaths. A day later, newly sworn-in President Joe Biden was poised to launch an ambitious plan to tackle the public health crisis, including distributing 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days, issuing a “100 Days Masking Challenge” to encourage the public to wear masks and requiring people to keep physically distant and wear masks in federal buildings and on federal lands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The President also intends to ask Congress to spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildbackbetter.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/COVID_Relief-Package-Fact-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;$400 billion to kick-start his national COVID-19 response&lt;/a&gt;. The plan includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$20 billion for a national vaccine program that would partner with states, localities and tribal nations to fast-track vaccine rollout. The plan calls for more vaccination sites, including mobile centers, and expanded efforts to reach underserved communities. The National Guard will also be made available to states to assist with the effort;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$50 billion to expand testing, including bolstering support for laboratories and purchasing rapid antigen tests;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funding 100,000 public health workers to aid in contact tracing, vaccine distribution or other needs of local health departments;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding paid leave programs to allow more workers to stay home if sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much money goes toward these, and other, efforts depends in part on Congress, and the details will likely change in the coming weeks. &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; talked with Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and an adviser to the Biden transition team’s COVID-19 advisory board, about the new administration’s plans to handle the pandemic. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would you describe the overall state of the pandemic, and pandemic response, that the Biden administration now faces?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osterholm&lt;/strong&gt;: There are two components. The first is the overall lack of a national plan [from the previous administration] and the lack of coordination in terms of the delivery of vaccines. There hasn’t been enough investment in state and local delivery systems, there hasn’t been enough attention paid to vaccine hesitancy. Expectations have been mismanaged. They’re inheriting an incredible challenge on the vaccine side, and it’s going to take a while to right that ship. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The additional challenge, which is in some ways my worst nightmare, is the B.1.1.7 strain that’s impacting the U.K. and Ireland so hard right now. It could take the pandemic to a whole new level. It’s possible that by mid- to late-February we could see a period where what’s happening right now seems not so bad. And all of this is falling right into the Biden administration’s lap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can the Biden administration improve vaccine rollout in the United States? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osterholm&lt;/strong&gt;: First of all is just transparency. The administration just has to be honest with the American people about what’s realistic in terms of production timelines and when certain people can get vaccinated. The previous administration has sometimes overpromised how many vaccines will be available when. When you create that kind of short-term excitement about the vaccine being available when it’s just not, it creates long-term confusion, anger and lack of trust. [The Biden administration is] going to have to manage [those feelings]. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next big thing is providing support to state and local health departments who are really the air traffic controllers in our communities for vaccination. All public health is local, and it varies dramatically across the country. To deliver a vaccine to a given local area, you’ve gotta know the area and how to best get the vaccine delivered there. Local public health departments know how to do that. They know what volunteer organizations to call on, what community centers they can use, whether they can get help from emergency response corps at universities or medical schools. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has never been much support from the federal government. Local health departments are stretched to near-breaking points. [Biden’s] plan acknowledges the critical role health departments play, and provides support in terms of funding and also people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: How can the Biden team ensure that people actually take the vaccines?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osterholm&lt;/strong&gt;: The first thing is to understand why people are vaccine hesitant, and there is no one answer. It’s different for different groups. Health care workers may be hesitant for different reasons than essential workers; it may be different for younger Black men versus older white men. Some people may be concerned with safety, others may have heard misinformation about mRNA vaccines altering DNA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The different concerns of different groups have to be ascertained, then you can figure out how to provide this kind of information to that group, figure out who are the peers you can bring together to build trust. For example, major pro sports heroes could publicly promote the vaccine. That kind of trust building is really important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: What other big pandemic challenges does the Biden team face and what can it do to best meet those?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osterholm&lt;/strong&gt;: Managing the potential impact of the B.1.1.7 variant. There are going to be calls for many additional measures to reduce transmission in a country that has gone way beyond pandemic fatigue and is almost in a stage of pandemic anger. How do you respond to that? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You have health care workers begging people not to put themselves at risk because of what they’re experiencing in the hospitals, working 16- to 18-hour days just trying to keep people alive. At the same time, you have people saying, “My small business shut down, I’ve lost my livelihood, I’m done. And I’m angry.” And that anger and frustration often gets put on the government, and I’m sure will spill over to the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This administration sees it and is prepared to deal with it. [Biden] acknowledges that this is tough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Personality traits were once thought to be fairly stable. But recent research has suggested that our personality can alter over time — whether that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/&quot;&gt;due to ageing&lt;/a&gt; or because we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/&quot;&gt;decide to change our traits ourselves&lt;/a&gt;. And as personality is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/04/here-are-the-personality-traits-most-strongly-associated-with-being-environmentally-conscious/&quot;&gt;linked to our behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, it follows that we might see different life outcomes as our personality shifts or grows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620957998&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Kevin A. Hoff and team look at the personality changes of teenagers as they move into adulthood. And they find that certain shifts in personality can result in real-world benefits during the early years of a career, suggesting that interventions that increase particular traits and skills could make all the difference at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41171&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team examined data from two longitudinal samples of young people from Iceland, who were followed over twelve years from their late teens to early adulthood; at several time-points, participants had rated their Big Five personality traits. The team also examined standardised test scores from the teenagers’ final year in education and noted the highest degree each participant had attained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also rated participants’ “occupational prestige” once in the workforce — how high or low status their work was seen to be in general society. Participants also shared how much money they earned, and indicated how satisfied they were with what they had achieved in their career thus far and in their current job. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the personality traits of the teens changed as they entered young adulthood. The largest increases were seen in agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness, while extraversion decreased. Personality traits at adolescence were stronger predictors of participants’ academic achievement than personality &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt;: those who were more conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable were more likely to attain a higher degree. Emotional stability and conscientiousness at school-age were also the strongest predictors of occupational prestige.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those personality changes, however, were also important. Participants who became more emotionally stable and those who became more extraverted were more likely to receive a higher income, while increases in emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness were the strongest predictors of career and job satisfaction across the samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that we can change our personality and increase how outgoing, agreeable, or open we are. And given the results of the study, it also seems possible that targeted interventions to help young people develop the skills associated with particular personalities could help them achieve certain goals. The fact that personality growth was the strongest predictor of the subjective measures of career and job satisfaction also indicates that growth is an important part of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; young people think about their success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though this study focused on work success, other areas of life could also be explored in future research. For some people, relationships, social skills or self-image are more important than their careers, and understanding how personality change can impact these dimensions would also be interesting. Certain personality traits are also likely to be more valued or useful in certain lines of work, so further exploration of this might also help teenagers work out which elements of their personality they would like to develop depending on their goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Helping teenagers understand that their personality is not fixed, the team concludes, is one of the most important takeaways from the study: while our personalities clearly play a part in our lives, we’re by no means fated to stay the same forever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620957998&quot;&gt;Personality Changes Predict Early Career Outcomes: Discovery and Replication in 12-Year Longitudinal Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Some bacteria are suffocating sea stars, turning the animals to goo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095536</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-suffocating-sea-stars-wasting-disease-goo</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mysterious culprit behind a deadly sea star disease is not an infection, as scientists once thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, multiple types of bacteria living within millimeters of sea stars’ skin deplete oxygen from the water and effectively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.610009/full&quot;&gt;suffocate the animals&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report January 6 in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;. Such microbes thrive when there are high levels of organic matter in warm water and create a low oxygen environment that can make sea stars melt in a puddle of slime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sea star wasting disease — which causes lethal symptoms like decaying tissue and loss of limbs — first gained notoriety in 2013 when sea stars living off the U.S. Pacific Coast died in massive numbers. Outbreaks of the disease had also occurred before 2013, but never at such a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists suspected that a virus or bacterium might be making sea stars sick. That hypothesis was supported in a 2014 study that found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/virus-implicated-sea-star-die&quot;&gt;unhealthy animals may have been infected by a virus&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/19/14&lt;/em&gt;). But the link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/cause-mass-starfish-die-offs-still-mystery&quot;&gt;vanished when subsequent studies&lt;/a&gt; found no relationship between the virus and dying sea stars, leaving researchers perplexed (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/5/16&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new finding that a boom of nutrient-loving bacteria can drain oxygen from the water and cause wasting disease “challenges us to think that there might not always be a single pathogen or a smoking gun,” says Melissa Pespeni, a biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington who was not involved in the work. Such a complex environmental scenario for killing sea stars “is a new kind of idea for [disease] transmission.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were certainly many red herrings during the hunt for why sea stars along North America’s Pacific Coast were melting into goo, says Ian Hewson, a marine biologist at Cornell University. In addition to the original hypothesis of a viral cause for sea star wasting disease — which Hewson’s team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/12/1416625111?sid=afcff1a9-eb0a-4ce3-ba97-abf858acbaf2&quot;&gt;reported in 2014&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; but later disproved — he and colleagues analyzed a range of other explanations, from differences in water temperature to exposing the animals to bacteria. But nothing reliably triggered wasting.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers examined the types of bacteria living with healthy sea stars compared with those living among the animals with wasting disease. “That was when we had our aha moment,” says Hewson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ochre sea star&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095538&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/011521_EG_sea-star_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095538&quot;&gt;Not all sea stars are susceptible to sea star wasting disease. Species that have more structures on their surface, and therefore more surface area for bacteria to deplete oxygen, appear more likely to get severely sick compared with flatter sea stars. In this photo, an ochre sea star (&lt;em&gt;Pisaster ochraceus&lt;/em&gt;) succumbs to the disease in Davenport, Calif., in June 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095538&quot;&gt;Ian Hewson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Types of bacteria known as copiotrophs, which thrive in environments with lots of nutrients, were present around the sea stars at higher levels than normal either shortly before the animals developed lesions or as they did so, Hewson and colleagues found. Bacterial species that survive only in environments with little to no oxygen were also thriving. In the lab, the sea stars began wasting when the researchers added phytoplankton or a common bacterial-growth ingredient to the warm water tubs those microbes and sea stars were living in.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experimentally depleting oxygen from the water had a similar effect, causing lesions in 75 percent of the animals, while none succumbed in the control group. Sea stars breathe by diffusing oxygen over small external projections called skin gills, so the lack of oxygen in the wake of flourishing copiotrophs leaves sea stars struggling for air, the data show. It’s unclear how the animals degrade in low oxygen conditions, but it could be due to massive cell death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the disease isn’t caused by a contagious pathogen, it is transmissible in the sense that dying sea stars generate more organic matter that spur bacteria to grow on healthy animals nearby. “It’s a bit of a snowball effect,” Hewson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also analyzed tissues from sea stars that had succumbed in the 2013 mass die-off — which followed a large algal bloom on the U.S. West Coast — to see if such environmental conditions might explain that outbreak. In fast-growing appendages that help them move, the sea stars that perished had high amounts of a form of nitrogen found in low oxygen conditions — a sign that those animals may have died from a lack of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem may get worse with climate change, Hewson says. “Warmer waters can’t have as much oxygen [compared with colder water] just by physics alone.” Bacteria, including copiotrophs, also flourish in warm water.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But pinpointing the likely cause could help experts better treat sick sea stars in the lab, Hewson says. Some techniques include increasing the oxygen levels in a water tank to make the gas more easily available to sea stars or getting rid of extra organic matter with ultraviolet light or water exchange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s still a lot to figure out with this disease, but I think [this new study] gets us a long way to understanding how it comes about,” Pespeni says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Astronomers spotted a rare galaxy shutting down star formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095495</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-rare-galaxy-cold-quasar-star-formation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A distant galaxy has been caught in the act of shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The galaxy, called CQ 4479, is still forming plenty of new stars. But it also has an actively feeding supermassive black hole at its center that will bring star formation to a halt within a few hundred million years, astronomers reported January 11 at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aas.org/meetings/aas237/&quot;&gt;virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society&lt;/a&gt;. Studying this galaxy and others like it will help astronomers figure out exactly how such shutdowns happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How galaxies precisely die is an open question,” says astrophysicist Allison Kirkpatrick of the University of Kansas in Lawrence. “This could give us a lot of insight into that process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers think galaxies typically start out making new stars with a passion. The stars form from pockets of cold gas that contract under their own gravity and ignite thermonuclear fusion in their centers. But at some point, something disrupts the cold star-forming fuel and sends it toward the supermassive black hole at the galaxy’s core. That black hole gobbles the gas, heating it white-hot. An actively feeding black hole can be seen from billions of light-years away and is known as a quasar. Radiation from the hot gas pumps extra energy into the rest of the galaxy, blowing away or heating up the remaining gas until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-may-shut-down-stellar-factories&quot;&gt;the star-forming factory closes for good&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/5/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That picture fits with the types of galaxies astronomers typically see in the universe: “blue and new” star formers, and “red and dead” dormant galaxies. But while examining data from large surveys of the sky, Kirkpatrick and colleagues noticed another type. The team found about two dozen galaxies that emit energetic X-rays characteristic of an actively gobbling black hole, but also shine in low-energy infrared light, revealing that there is still cold gas somewhere in the galaxies. Kirkpatrick and colleagues dubbed these galaxies “cold quasars” in a paper in the Sept. 1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba358/meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you see a black hole actively accreting material, you expect that star formation has already shut down,” says coauthor and astrophysicist Kevin Cooke, also of the University of Kansas, who presented the research at the meeting. “But cold quasars are in a weird time when the black hole in the center has just begun to feed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To investigate individual cold quasars in more detail, Kirkpatrick and Cooke used SOFIA, an airplane outfitted with a telescope that can see in a range of infrared wavelengths that the original cold quasar observations didn’t cover. SOFIA looked at CQ 4479, a cold quasar about 5.25 billion light-years away, in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The observations showed that CQ 4479 has about 20 billion times the mass of the sun in stars, and it’s adding about 95 suns per year. (That’s a furious rate compared with the Milky Way; our home galaxy builds two or three solar masses of new stars per year.) CQ 4479’s central black hole is 24 million times as massive as the sun, and it’s growing at about 0.3 solar masses per year. In terms of percentage of their total mass, the stars and the black hole are growing at the same rate, Kirkpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cold quasar CQ 4479&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095496&quot; height=&quot;611&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/011321_lg_cold_quasar_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095496&quot;&gt;The cold quasar CQ 4479, the blue fuzzy dot at the center of this image, showed up in images taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The red dot nearby might be another galaxy interacting with CQ 4479, or it could be unrelated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095496&quot;&gt;K.C. Cooke &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/arxiv.org 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sdss.org/&quot;&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sort of “lockstep evolution” runs counter to theories of how galaxies wax and wane. “You should have all your stars finish growing first, and then your black hole grows,” Kirkpatrick says. “This [galaxy] shows there’s a period that they actually do grow together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cooke and colleagues estimated that in half a billion years, the galaxy will host 100 billion solar masses of stars, but its black hole will be passive and quiet. All the cold star-forming gas will have heated up or blown away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The observations of CQ 4479 support the broad ideas of how galaxies die, says astronomer Alexandra Pope of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the new work. Given that galaxies eventually switch off their star formation, it makes sense that there should be a period of transition. The findings are a “confirmation of this important phase in the evolution of galaxies,” she says. Taking a closer look at more cold quasars will help astronomers figure out just how quickly galaxies die.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: The first magnetar flare detected from another galaxy was tracked to its home</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095526</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetar-flare-first-home-galaxy-star-fast-radio-burst</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, astronomers have definitively spotted a flaring magnetar in another galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These ultra-magnetic stellar corpses were thought to be responsible for some of the highest-energy explosions in the nearby universe. But until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9243/presentation/1768&quot;&gt;this burst&lt;/a&gt;, no one could prove it, astronomers reported January 13 at the virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society and in papers in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have seen flaring magnetars in the Milky Way, but those are so bright that it’s impossible to get a good look at them. Possible glimpses of flaring magnetars in other galaxies may have been spotted before, too. But “the others were all a little circumstantial, and not as rock solid,” says astrophysicist Victoria Kaspi of the McGill Space Institute in Montreal, who was not involved in the new discovery. “Here you have something that is so incontrovertible, it’s like, okay, this is it. There’s no question anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first sign of the magnetar arrived as a blast of X-rays and gamma rays on April 15. Five telescopes in space, including the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Mars Odyssey orbiter, observed the blast, giving scientists enough information to track down its source: the galaxy NGC 253, or the Sculptor galaxy, 11.4 million light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;At first, astronomers thought that the blast was a type of cataclysmic explosion called a short gamma-ray burst, or GRB, which are typically caused by colliding neutron stars or other destructive cosmic events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the signal looked weird for a short GRB: It rose to peak brightness quickly, within two milliseconds, tailed off for another 50 milliseconds and appeared to be over by about 140 milliseconds. As the signal faded, some of the telescopes detected fluctuations in the light that changed faster than a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typical short GRBs that result from a neutron star collision don’t change like that, said astrophysicist Oliver Roberts of the Universities Space Research Association in Huntsville, Ala. But flaring magnetars in our own galaxy do, when the bright spot where the flare was emitted comes in and out of view as the magnetar spins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, surprisingly, the Fermi telescope caught gamma rays with energies higher than a gigaelectronvolt arriving four minutes after the initial blast. There is no way for the known sources of short GRBs to do that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve discovered a masquerading magnetar in a nearby galaxy, and we’ve unmasked it,” said astrophysicist Kevin Hurley of the University of California, Berkeley at a Jan. 13 news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A flaring magnetar sent a blast of light (magenta) and particles (cyan) zipping through space, as shown in this animation. Astronomers think the interaction between those particles and the environment around the magnetar could help explain the blast’s strange appearance.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that the flare was triggered by a massive starquake, one thousand trillion trillion, or 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;, times as large as the 9.5 magnitude earthquake recorded in Chile in 1960. “I’m from California, and out here we would definitely call that the Big One,” Hurley says. The quake led the magnetar to release a blob of plasma that sped away at nearly the speed of light, emitting gamma rays and X-rays as it went.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery suggests that at least some signals that look like short GRBs are in fact from magnetar flares, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetars-may-fuel-briefer-bursts&quot;&gt;astronomers have long suspected&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/3/10&lt;/em&gt;). It also means that three earlier events that astronomers had flagged as possible magnetar flares probably were actually from the magnetized stellar corpses, giving astronomers a population of magnetar flares to compare to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding could have exciting implications for fast radio bursts, another mysterious cosmic signal that has had astronomers scratching their heads for over a decade. Several lines of evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts&quot;&gt;connect fast radio bursts to magnetars&lt;/a&gt;, including another signal coming from within the Milky Way that coincidentally also arrived in April 2020 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/4/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That [discovery] leant extra credence to fast radio bursts being [from] magnetars,” Kaspi says, though there are still problems with that theory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kaspi has compared the apparent frequency of magnetar flares in other galaxies to the frequency of fast radio bursts and found that the rates are similar. “That argues that actually, most or all fast radio bursts could be magnetars…. I don’t think yet it’s the total solution,” but it’s a good step, she says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How To Be A Good Negotiator, According To Psychology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41166</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/19/how-to-be-a-good-negotiator-according-to-psychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good negotiators are more likely to secure a pay rise, get the house or job they want, and keep the peace at home. No end of psychological studies have explored which attitudes, behaviours, and settings will help a negotiation go your way. Here, we take a look at some of the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41166&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way to prepare for a negotiation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty of studies have found that people in positions of low power tend to do worse in a negotiation than people with high power. A job interviewer or someone with a desirable house to sell falls into the high-power category. So if you’re about to walk into an interview, or start negotiating over a house or car, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167215577365&quot;&gt;it would help if you first engaged in a little self-affirmation&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study on MBA students. Before going into a meeting in which they were acting as the would-be buyer of a biotech plant, some of the participants spent five minutes writing about their most important negotiating skill. In the subsequent negotiation, for this group, the typical high-power advantage of the “seller” was significantly reduced, and they secured lower sale prices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than going into a negotiation with the view that a gain for one side is a loss for the other (a so-called “win-lose mindset”), it’s worth remembering that, depending on the terms of the deal, it could be win-win. That’s according to the authors of a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in 2019. The team found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000427&quot;&gt;people in a position of financial vulnerability were more likely to hold the win-lose mindset&lt;/a&gt; by default, and less likely to capitalise on any opportunities for both sides to gain. “By holding this win-lose mindset, financially disadvantaged people may continue to make poor deals, perpetuating their situation,” says Marko Pitesa at the Singapore Management University, who was involved in the research. But being aware of this mentality might help to stop it happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I kick off a negotiation in the right way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A work-related negotiation doesn’t have to happen in the office, of course. In fact, a far better location would be a restaurant that serves food on sharing platters… This, at least, was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830633&quot;&gt;shared plates, shared minds&lt;/a&gt;” finding of a study published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2019. Pairs of participants who’d shared a single bowl of crisps and salsa went on to require, on average, nine rounds of negotiation to resolve a theoretical wage dispute, four rounds fewer than pairs who’d eaten the same snack from their own bowls. The shared eating promoted cooperation, the team thinks. “Basically, every meal that you’re eating alone is a missed opportunity to connect to someone,” says co-author Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago. “And every meal that involves food sharing fully utilizes the opportunity to create that social bond.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small alcoholic drink &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/17/a-small-alcoholic-drink-could-benefit-business-negotiations-study-finds/&quot;&gt;could be a helpful addition to the meal, too&lt;/a&gt;. When both participants in a bargaining game had one 350ml glass of beer, they became more collaborative, compared with those who’d drunk juice. “In settings in which skepticism can lead to a breakdown in negotiation, alcohol consumption can make people drop their guard for each other’s actions, thus facilitating reaching an agreement,” the team explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will anger help me get what I want? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/11/why-you-should-add-a-bit-of-grrrrr-to-your-negotiations/&quot;&gt;you should add a bit of grrr to your negotiations&lt;/a&gt; has a long history. While some studies have found that it isn’t a good idea, others have suggested that pretending you are angry can be helpful, especially if the person you are negotiating with is in a pretty weak position. However, the effect of anger &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/07/09/effect-of-anger-on-negotiations-depends-on-cultural-context/&quot;&gt;does depend on the cultural context&lt;/a&gt;: a 2010 study found that while it could help in a negotiation with someone from a European background, it backfired in negotiations with someone from an East Asian background, where traditionally such behaviour is regarded as inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the effect of getting angry on the negotiation will also depend at least partly on what you &lt;em&gt;expec&lt;/em&gt;t it to be. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-29279-001&quot;&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/20/the-effect-of-emotions-on-your-behaviour-depends-partly-on-your-expectations/&quot;&gt;participants in a negotiation task who’d been led to believe that anger would be helpful and who felt more angry during the task did make more money&lt;/a&gt;. But for those who had not been guided in this way, whether they felt angry or not made no difference to how much money they made. As the team wrote: “At least in some cases, what we expect emotions to do may determine what they actually do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is face-to-face negotiation always best?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, that depends… If you have Dark Triad tendencies — if you’d score highly for narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915300738?via=ihub&quot;&gt;then yes, you’d be much better off negotiating in person&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study of 200 Canadian students. The team asked the participants to negotiate for concert tickets, as a buyer or seller, either face-to-face or via text on a computer. Those who ranked higher on the Dark Triad spectrum did better in face-to-face negotiations than negotiations via the computer, whereas those who’d ranked low in these traits did better online compared to in-person. In fact, when negotiating via computer, those who’d placed higher on the Dark Triad spectrum were significantly less successful than the others. Whatever the ability of such people to charm, manipulate or intimidate others in person, they lose this edge when negotiating online, the team concludes. This also implies, of course, that if you think your boss might have Dark Triad tendencies, it could be better to conduct a negotiation over a pay rise by email rather than face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to negotiations via text, there are a few other things to consider. For instance, a negotiating pair is more likely to reach mutually agreeable terms in an online discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/07/physical-distance-boosts-the-success-of-computer-based-negotiation/&quot;&gt;when they think of each other as being physically distant, rather than physically close&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, two people did the negotiating. But what if you used an Artificial Intelligence agent to do your negotiating — a task that AI agents, or bots, are tipped to take over? This does affect our negotiation strategies, according to a recent study in the US. Among other things, the team found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/27/were-more-willing-to-use-deceitful-tactics-when-a-bot-does-the-negotiating/&quot;&gt;less experienced negotiators are more likely to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about negotiating at home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like a job offer, or a bid for your house, you don’t have to take it. But if you’re in a relationship, and want to stay in it, you will have to find ways to negotiate your way through all kinds of disagreements, from the minor — such as plans for the weekend — to the major (whether to take a job in another country, say.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In all these situations, it would be worth bearing in mind the results of a recent analysis of data on more than 32,000 people from nine different countries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/25/how-making-sacrifices-for-a-partner-or-saying-you-will-affects-wellbeing/&quot;&gt; if you feel that you would in theory be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both&lt;/a&gt;. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; that they would), it’s a different story. The data suggests that in these situations, the person actually making a sacrifice tends to feel the burden of it. Gaining a major concession from your partner could clearly, then, end up being a case not merely of win-lose, but lose-lose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Monitor lizards’ huge burrow systems can shelter hundreds of small animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095509</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monitor-lizards-huge-burrow-systems-shelter-small-animals</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meters below the copper, sun-broiled dirt of northwestern Australia, an entire community hides in the dark. Geckos lay their eggs as centipedes and scorpions scuttle by. A snake glides deeper underground, away from the light. This subterranean menagerie is capitalizing on an old burrow, gouged into the earth by a massive lizard. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study shows that two different species of Australian monitor lizard dig arrays of these burrows into the earth and that the openings have a great impact on local biodiversity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3271&quot;&gt;providing shelter to a surprisingly wide assortment of animal life&lt;/a&gt;. The findings, published December 18 in &lt;em&gt;Ecology,&lt;/em&gt; indicate that the lizards are “ecosystem engineers,” akin to beavers that flood streams with dams or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-poop-helps-keep-coral-reefs-healthy-rats-are-messing&quot;&gt;seabirds that fertilize reefs with their guano&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers say (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: 7/11/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sean Doody, an ecologist at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg, started monitoring the cat-sized lizards in northern Australia with colleagues from Australia’s University of Canberra in Bruce and the University of Newcastle. The team was tracking how invasive, poisonous cane toads were adversely impacting the reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it wasn’t clear where monitor lizards lay their eggs. Reaching into burrows thought to contain their eggs yielded nothing. Then Doody and his team started excavating burrows of the yellow-spotted monitor (&lt;em&gt;Varanus panoptes&lt;/em&gt;) and found that the holes were a tight helical shape, plunging into the soil roughly four meters — &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bij.12589&quot;&gt;deeper than any other known vertebrate nest&lt;/a&gt; — with eggs at the very bottom. What’s more, the nests were part of a warren consisting of dozens of twisting burrows, each made by a single monitor and arranged in the soil like dozens of fusilli noodles set vertically. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We kept digging these things up, and we started finding lots of animals in most of them,” Doody says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;nesting burrow of a sand goanna&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095512&quot; height=&quot;677&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/011121_jb_lizard-burrow_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095512&quot;&gt;A helical nesting burrow (shown) of a sand goanna (&lt;em&gt;Varanus gouldii&lt;/em&gt;) has been excavated, revealing six turns in the clockwise direction. The twisting tunnel has been sprayed with pink paint to distinguish it from the surrounding soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095512&quot;&gt;Sean Doody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found arthropods, snakes, toads and other lizards in the nests of yellow-spotted monitors and sand goanna monitors (&lt;em&gt;Varanus gouldii&lt;/em&gt;), which dig similar burrows. At first it was a few creatures here and there, Doody says, but then the team found 418 &lt;em&gt;Uperoleia&lt;/em&gt; frogs in a single warren. In all, the team found nearly 750 individuals of 28 different vertebrate species in a combination of 16 warrens made up of many individual nesting burrows and a handful of foraging burrows, made when the lizards dig for prey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some animals are using the burrows for overwintering, Doody says. Others use them as refuges when the creatures need to go dormant during the hot dry summer. Still others catch prey in there, while “some are probably hiding from predators. And some are even laying their eggs in the burrow.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, Doody says, he and his colleagues found very few mammals using the burrows. With the “massive smell of reptile” in there they may steer clear, he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The range of nonmammals using the burrows is “incredible,” especially given the reptiles’ broad appetite, says Sophie Cross, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Monitors] will pretty much eat anything they can catch or dig out from the ground,” she says. “I am surprised that so many animals use these burrows, given a lot of them would be easy prey for a monitor lizard.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the smaller residents use the burrows at a different time than the monitors, the two groups might avoid conflict. The monitors appear to lay their eggs over a few weeks and leave, letting them incubate over the eight-month dry season, Doody says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the widespread use of the burrows by wildlife, Doody has concerns about the broader ecological effects of the ongoing cane toad invasion in Australia’s tropical north. Monitor lizards — naïve to the toads’ potent toxins — will eat the amphibians, with lethal consequences. As a result, monitors are rapidly dying, Doody says, and their warrens are filling in, leaving less refuge for other animals using the burrows. “You go from hundreds of animals using a warren system to zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Doody wants to investigate why some animals make helical burrows in the first place. The practice is rare, with creatures like beach crabs, some extinct rodents and pocket gophers being some of the only other examples. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the new study, that research may be crucial for changing public perceptions of reptiles, which can be maligned out of fear, Cross says. “It’s great to see research like this highlight how important [reptiles] can be in ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=145652</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;You know the way Google search will sometimes finish your sentences for you? Or, when you’re typing an email, there’s some ghostly predictive text that floats just in front of your cursor? Well, there’s a new kid on the block that makes these gadgets look like toy tricks out of a Christmas cracker. Give it a sentence of Jane Austen and it will finish the paragraph in the same style. Give it a philosophical conjecture and it will fill the page with near-coherent academic ruminations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt; is essentially just predicting what words should come next, following on from the prompt it’s been given. That the machine does so well is partly because it’s been trained on an unimaginably huge database of samples of English (reputedly, $13 million worth of training). A similar machine can predict, from a sequence of amino acids, how the resulting protein will fold, short-cutting months of lab work and in some cases years of human ingenuity (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt;). But what is going on inside the machine? What is it keeping track of inside its huge neural network “brain”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We face the same question, of course, when we look at the human brain—a seemingly inscrutable organ of even greater complexity. Yet neuroscience is beginning to make sense of what’s going on inside: of patterns of activity distributed across millions of neurons, flowing into other patterns; coupling and modulating; unfolding in a way that opens the organism to the world outside, projected through its inner space of needs and drives, bathed in the wash of past experience, reaching out to control and modify that world to its own agenda. We can now see what some of these patterns of activity are, and we have an inkling of what they are doing, of how they track the environment, and subserve behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are recording these patterns with new techniques. But what do the patterns mean? How should they be understood? Neuroscience is increasingly tackling these questions by asking what the activation patterns &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308009434&quot;&gt;“representational similarity analysis”&lt;/a&gt; (RSA) is used to ask whether the human brain processes images in the same way as the brain of the macaque monkey. Surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619.short&quot;&gt;similar techniques&lt;/a&gt; can be used to compare the human brain to an AI computer system trained to perform the same task. These AIs are deep neural networks, cousins of the seemingly unfathomable GPT-3 and AlphaFold brains we met at the start. Astoundingly, it turns out that sometimes the deep neural network is processing images in roughly the same way as the human brain. In a general sense, both are performing the same computations en route to working out that they are looking at a picture of two cats on a sofa. In other cases, we see the brain using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~papers.nips.cc/paper/9104-better-transfer-learning-with-inferred-successor-maps&quot;&gt;hexagonal code&lt;/a&gt; to represent physical space—and more abstract conceptual spaces—and to reason about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that representation has become something of a hot topic in cognitive neuroscience. Representation has always been around, of course, working away in the foundations ever since the “cognitive revolution” showed that we could explain behaviour in terms of internal processing without having to feel embarrassed about intelligent homunculi or ghosts in the machine. What we have now are much better ways to see those representations in the brain and to marry them up with the computational story about how the organism intelligently deals with its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we still need is a proper understanding of what representation is—an understanding of how there come to be things in the head which stand in for, and allow creatures to deal with, things in their environment. A once-unconventional idea in contemporary philosophy (originating with Ruth Millikan, David Papineau, and Karen Neander) is that this is intimately tied up with function—biological functions based on natural selection. Although a connection to function may have always been implicit in some scientific practice, it is now being recognised explicitly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3017&quot;&gt;Hunt et al. 2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2&quot;&gt;Richards et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). For example, in a recent manifesto for the role of representation in computational cognitive neuroscience, Kriegeskorte and Diedrichsen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-080317-061906&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;) argue that representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour. Meanwhile in philosophy, appealing to natural teleology to explain representation has moved into the mainstream, being embraced by researchers from diverse disciplinary starting points (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9432-4&quot;&gt;David Haig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-metaphysics-of-representation-9780198850205&quot;&gt;Robert Williams&lt;/a&gt;), alongside recent landmark contributions from early advocates (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mark-mental&quot;&gt;Karen Neander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/beyond-concepts-9780198717195&quot;&gt;Ruth Millikan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details, of course, but it is beginning to look as if we have the main ingredients in place: internal states that stand in useful relations to things in the environment, internal processing which relies on those relations, and the functions that serves for the organism. Just as the cognitive sciences come to lean on representation ever more heavily, it seems that we now have the resources to understand this foundational notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stock.adobe.com/images/brain-data-ai-technology-robotic-molecule-of-chemical-atom-cell-science-hacker-online-cyber-network-system-of-background-illustration-3d-rendering-futuristic-cloud-storage-deep-learning/271835259&quot;&gt;issaronow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/what-is-representation-in-the-human-brain-and-ai-systems/&quot;&gt;What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/641921470/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/playing-to-lose-transhumanism-autonomy-and-liberal-democracy-long-read/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Playing to lose: transhumanism, autonomy, and liberal democracy [long read]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/essenes-in-judaean-society-the-sectarians-of-the-dead-sea-scrolls/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Essenes in Judaean Society: the sectarians of the Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/understanding-black-holes-young-star-clusters-filling-up-gaps/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Understanding black holes: young star clusters filling up gaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network Announce Community Action Publishing Deal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18622</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/fDxkkE9i7GI/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA and OTTAWA, ON — The Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for CRKN members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program, a new collective action publishing model from PLOS, enabling 19 participating CRKN institutions to publish fee-free in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; PLOS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biology. &lt;/em&gt;This model shifts publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history as affiliated with corresponding and contributing authors. The group collectively contributes to the shared cost recovery target and any surplus revenue collected by PLOS is redistributed to members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to welcome PLOS’ very first Canadian partners to our Community Action Publishing program. Despite a very difficult budget landscape, Canadian institutions’ commitment to community-driven Open Access experimentation remains as strong as ever,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “As ever, we’re excited to partner with institutions sharing our mission to further equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CRKN members’ participation in this innovative publishing initiative from PLOS highlights Canada’s dedication to furthering open access,” commented Clare Appavoo, Executive Director of CRKN. “Bold ideas drive our community forward, and it is inspiring to see publishers like PLOS advancing new business models for open scholarship. We look forward to collaborating with PLOS as the model and program develop.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN participating members include: Brock University, McMaster University, Mount Allison University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Ontario Tech University, Queen’s University, Simon Fraser University, Université Laval, University of Alberta, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa, University of Saskatchewan, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, Western University, Wilfrid Laurier University, and York University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the Community Action Publishing agreement, which began on January 1, 2021, authors from participating CRKN institutions will have unlimited publishing in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating CRKN institutions are eligible, and new institutions are permitted to join the agreement at any time during this initial three-year period. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN, which represents 81 academic and research institutions across Canada, joins the University of California and Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) among others in signing open access publishing agreements with PLOS in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Revisiting The “Brain Drain” Effect: Having A Phone On The Desk Doesn’t Always Impair Our Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41158</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/18/revisiting-the-brain-drain-effect-having-a-phone-on-the-desk-doesnt-always-impair-our-memory/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know that using a smartphone interferes with our ability to focus on other things — like driving. But in 2017, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462&quot;&gt;surprising result&lt;/a&gt; made international headlines: the mere presence of a switched off smartphone on the desk can impair working memory. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020301975?via=ihub&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, which has partially replicated and extended this investigation, has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; found evidence to support the “brain drain” effect. However, the researchers, led by Matthias Hartmann at University of Bern, Switzerland, say that we shouldn’t start putting our phones back on our desks just yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41158&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2017 study was led by Adrian Ward at the University of Texas, Austin. His team found that people who’d been instructed to put their phones in another room performed significantly better on tests designed to measure their cognitive capacity than those who had their phones on the desk. They also did slightly better than participants who’d put their phone in a pocket or bag. It didn’t matter whether their phones were off or on or face up or down; just having the phone easily accessible meant that people had to resist the impulse to use it, which used some of their available cognitive capacity, the team concluded. This meant they had less to spare on the tasks, which drew on working memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hartmann and his colleagues decided to investigate possible impacts on two other types of memory: short term memory and also prospective memory — remembering to do something in the future. They recruited 302 participants with a mean age of about 22, and asked all to put their phones into flight mode. Half were told that they could leave their phone on their desk, while the other half had their phones taken by the experimenter and placed on the opposite side of the room, so that, they were told, they would not be distracted by them. (Since it’s normal to ask study participants not to use their phones, the team didn’t expect this to alert them to the nature of the study.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants were then presented with a series of pictures of easily identifiable objects paired with unrelated words. They were told to read each word aloud and to memorise the pictures. Every so often, they were asked to say out loud as many of the pictures as they could remember from the previous block, and an experimenter wrote these down. This was the test of their short-term memory. Before embarking on a second series of word-picture presentations, they were told to inform the experimenter whenever they saw a word that belonged in the category of “musical instruments”. This tested their prospective memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that whether participants’ phones were in clear view or on the other side of the room made no overall difference to performance on these memory tasks. The participants had also completed questionnaires measuring their impulsiveness and their levels of smartphone dependence, and, when the team took a closer look at this data, a link — albeit an unexpected one — did pop out. Those people who ranked low for smartphone dependence did poorer on the prospective memory test when their phone was in view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What should we make of all this? Given the 2017 findings, “the lack of an effect of smartphone presence on short-term memory performance was surprising,” the team writes. There were some methodological differences between the two studies, they note. Further work to more perfectly replicate the initial study is now needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the prospective memory findings, “our results seem to suggest that the benefit of smartphone absence disappears for people with higher levels of smartphone dependency,” the team writes, “as if the negative effects of missing one’s own smartphone when it is absent counteracts the positive effect of smartphone absence.” However, given the limited data so far, it’s too early to draw any firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that there is strong evidence from a range of earlier studies that “personally relevant” stimuli — like our phones — can impair our performance on cognitive tasks. “Our results should therefore not motivate people to put their smartphones on their desks at work,” they conclude. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020301975&quot;&gt;Does a smartphone on the desk drain our brain? No evidence of cognitive costs due to smartphone presence in a short-term and prospective memory task&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-12242 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/COVID-19-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ladds et. al&lt;/em&gt; describes “long Covid” as fluctuating symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, fever, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations, cognitive deficits, myalgia, neurological symptoms, skin rashes, and diarrhoea beyond 3-4 weeks after infection. Despite the great advances in COVID-19 research, there is minimal knowledge about managing “long Covid”. This is emphasized by the participant’s instrumental role in the recruitment and development of this study. This online qualitative study reports the experiences of 114 participants from the UK weeks after their acute illness to better understand COVID-19. These focus groups reveal that those who experience “long Covid” endure difficulty accessing health services despite their uncertain prognosis and occasionally severe reoccurring symptoms. This study informs a basis to improve services while highlighting the importance of patient support groups to better navigate this ambiguous illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12241&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/Cannibus-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cannabis consumption increases worldwide, it is crucial to investigate the effects of prenatal and maternal cannabis use on birth outcomes. &lt;em&gt;Michalski et al&lt;/em&gt;. observe that pre-pregnancy cannabis users experience 2.0 times the odds of birthing an infant with low birth weight, small size for gestational age, or preterm birth. Here, 216 women self-reported cannabis use in their pre/early pregnancy period while disclosing low rates of concurrent substance use such as alcohol and tobacco. While many studies aim to investigate this trend among pregnant women, this Ontario-based study confirms the specific impacts of cannabis use on infant health. Although there is more research to complete in regards to other modes of cannabis consumption, this study emphasizes the need for clinical messaging to expecting mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12243&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/Pesticides-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boedeker et. al&lt;/em&gt; performed a systematic review examining the prevalence of a widely overlooked national and international public health issue called unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning. This study identified that farm workers and farmers account for 385 million cases of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning cases and around 11,000 deaths per year due to occupational exposure. Boedecker and team conclude this only accounts for a fraction of annual poisonings as registers and hospitals may underreport non-fatal events. Unfortunately, unintentional acute pesticide poisoning can lead to chronic outcomes such as a decreased quality of life or even the inability to continue working arguing the imperative of enhancing the accuracy of national databases and improving access to medical care and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12244&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/29481776026_0dd45efbf9_b-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the availability of mental health care for migrant populations who continue to experience high levels of mental health issues. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 10 psychotherapists across Germany whom have experience in dealing with refugee’s mental health problems, the authors were able to identify three main challenges in this cross-cultural practice. These include, differing or unrealistic expectations of clients towards what psychotherapy may offer, challenges integrated in illness explanatory models and communication challenges. Aside from identifying the main challenges with cross-cultural psychotherapy the authors showed that psychotherapy with refugees can be extremely successful but identifies challenges that underline the importance of designing and introducing new structural approaches to training psychotherapists for the introduction of psychotherapy at scale. As the incidence of mental health problems among refugee populations continues to increase, the ability to provide appropriate mental health support to these vulnerable individuals becomes ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12245&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/Mother_and_son_holding_hands-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Governments and health systems, dealing with end-of-life issues presents a major challenge. Despite progress in the introduction of relevant legislature, many barriers still exist to its proper implementation. By conducting 37 in-depth interviews with professionals and decision makers associated with the health care system in Israel the authors were able to identify 6 major barriers to coping with end-of-life issues. These include, Law procedures, Clinical aspects, Human aspects, Knowledge/skill, Communication and finally Resource allocation. They find that ubiquitously the relationship between the patient and their clinical care teams is important. With medical teams often in daily contact with the patient they inherit significant responsibility in implementation of end-of-life care. The authors conclude that by improving or championing accessibility to homes able to provide appropriate care for end-of-life needs, increased public and health system awareness, and support in understanding end-of-life laws, health systems and governments can aim to ensure the best care for end-of-life patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The most ancient supermassive black hole is bafflingly big</title>

	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The most ancient black hole ever discovered is so big it defies explanation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This active supermassive black hole, or quasar, boasts a mass of 1.6 billion suns and lies at the heart of a galaxy more than 13 billion light-years from Earth. The quasar, dubbed J0313-1806, dates back to when the universe was just 670 million years old, or about 5 percent of the universe’s current age. That makes J0313-1806 two times heavier and 20 million years older than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/most-distant-quasar-universe-infancy&quot;&gt;last record-holder&lt;/a&gt; for earliest known black hole (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/6/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding such a huge supermassive black hole so early in the universe’s history challenges astronomers’ understanding of how these cosmic beasts first formed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9243/presentation/1165&quot;&gt;researchers reported&lt;/a&gt; January 12 at a virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society and in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03179&quot;&gt;paper posted&lt;/a&gt; at arXiv.org on January 8.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supermassive black holes are thought to grow from smaller seed black holes that gobble up matter. But astronomer Feige Wang of the University of Arizona and colleagues calculated that even if J0313-1806’s seed formed right after the first stars in the universe and grew as fast as possible, it would have needed a starting mass of at least 10,000 suns. The normal way seed black holes form — through the collapse of massive stars — can only make black holes up to a few thousand times as massive as the sun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gargantuan seed black hole may have formed through the direct collapse of vast amounts of primordial hydrogen gas, says study coauthor Xiaohui Fan, also an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Or perhaps J0313-1806’s seed started out small, forming through stellar collapse, and black holes can grow a lot faster than scientists think. “Both possibilities exist, but neither is proven,” Fan says. “We have to look much earlier [in the universe] and look for much less massive black holes to see how these things grow.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: The more contagious coronavirus variant may soon be the U.S.’s dominant strain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095516</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A highly contagious coronavirus variant will become the dominant version of the virus in the United States in March, emphasizing the need for more rapid vaccination, a new modeling study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus variant was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread&quot;&gt;first identified in December in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/22/20&lt;/em&gt;). Called B.1.1.7, it has some mutations that may help the virus better spread among people, though the variant isn’t thought to cause more severe disease. It has so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html&quot;&gt;been detected in 76 COVID-19 cases across 12 U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;. Because experts have analyzed the genetic fingerprints of only a small percentage of the millions of coronavirus infections in the United States, however, it’s unclear how widespread B.1.1.7 might be. Experts estimate that the variant currently causes less than half a percent of U.S. COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while B.1.1.7 might be present at low levels now, it has the potential to drive a surge in U.S. cases and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm?s_cid=mm7003e2_w&quot;&gt;outpace the most prevalent viral variants&lt;/a&gt; currently infecting people in two months, researchers report January 15 in &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. Because B.1.1.7 is likely more transmissible, people must be more rigorous about following public health guidelines such as wearing masks to curb its spread, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“These measures will be more effective if they are instituted sooner rather than later,” the researchers warn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, the team simulated how the variant might spread in the country from January to April 2021. Assuming that the variant is 50 percent more transmissible than other viral versions already spreading in the United States and that around 10 to 30 percent of people have immunity against any form of the virus from a previous bout of COVID-19, B.1.1.7 could cause most coronavirus cases in the country by March, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinating 1 million people a day, however, would help substantially reduce how many COVID-19 cases — and thus hospitalizations and deaths — caused by the new variant ultimately occur, though the variant would still dominate U.S. cases in March, the modeling study suggests. Since the rollout of vaccines in December, more than 10 million people have been inoculated against the coronavirus in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reducing coronavirus transmission overall, including the spread of other variants, could also further reduce how much B.1.1.7 spreads, even after it becomes the dominant variant. More rigorous efforts to limit the spread of the virus — including more compliance with following public health guidelines like wearing masks and staying away from crowds — will slow the variant’s spread and give medical experts more time to vaccinate more people and build up community immunity, the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Spike: The Core Computational Principles of a Neuron</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/ed0fe9cfb711</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/the-spike/neuron-core-computational-principles-ed0fe9cfb711?source=rss----c92c31591e3a---4</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;To spike or not to spike?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f-PUy8OtUgBjR9CStS5Jzw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that a neuron is the main cell of the nervous system. It generates electrical pulses as large as 0.1Volts, has sprouts — axons (as long as 1 meter) and dendrites (several millimeters), and lives more than 100 years. You will not find another more marvelous cell in the body. Still, I will not write about biological details (despite how interesting they are). Rather, I will try to define the most important computational principles, which might help with the progression to artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence towards principles always leads to simplification and generalization, but it can be dangerous. The brain is too diverse. You can simplify too much and lose something important. Let’s dare to try. Ultimately, it is an iterative process. We merely want to become less wrong with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 1. Neurons are binary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron generates and transmits electrical pulses (also called spikes). They are very similar in amplitude and duration, so they can be treated as binary events (spike=1, no spike=0). Yet, we don’t fully understand how exactly thousands and millions of neurons represent knowledge, perform basic calculations, and store casual relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurons transmit information by the frequency of spikes. For example, the more a motor-neuron activates in the spinal cord, the stronger the muscle contracts. For a long time, people thought that other neurons in the cerebral cortex send information in a similar way. After the famous Hubel and Wiesel experiments, we know that a neuron in a visual area has a higher spike frequency for a particular stimulus. If the cat sees the vertical line, a particular neuron activates very fast, but if we rotate the line — the neuron slows down. This can be summarized in a tuning curve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/325/1*fpzzvLZv1y6FskcgHK0FCA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many decades, the idea of frequency coding was dominant. Even now, artificial neural networks use the same coding (real numbers). But a nasty problem ruins the frequency view: to “measure” the rate of firing you need to wait for a long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to average spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the brain computes much faster. Humans need around 100 ms to recognize an object. Information travels from the retina to the thalamus, then is projected to the visual cortex, where it hops across three or four areas before reaching the IT area. Here the recognition of an object occurs. Taking into account the time for spike generation (2–5 ms) and spike propagation (roughly 10–20ms), there is just enough time to send 1–2 pulses… and no way to wait longer to “send” the frequency of firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, individual spikes (0 or 1) somehow should be enough to transmit information. Currently, the prevailing idea is that an individual neuron does not send a lot, but many of them can encode anything (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Population_coding&quot;&gt;population coding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, my friend asked me: “How does the brain encode information? Perhaps with something super complex?”. “No”, I said. “Most likely, it uses a binary code similar to computers, but the principles are very different.” Neural coding is one of the most compelling areas of research with many mysteries and open problems. Intriguingly, it relates nicely to information theory. It is not just about data representation, but about something fundamental, about the organization of matter to reflect nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we are still far from fully understanding the neural code. There are bursting neurons that emit many spikes very fast. Can we simplify the burst of pulses as one binary event? Neuromodulators change how the neuron is excited. Possibly, different brain regions (like sensory and motor) use different coding schemes. Yet, most likely the main tasks like recognition, memory, and planning use binary codes (that can be modulated in various ways).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 2. Neurons integrate information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical neuron in neocortex has around 10 000 connections and more than 100 of them are active simultaneously. Information integration means that a neuron “hears” all 10 thousand “calls” and compresses them to 0 or 1 (spike or no spike). Mathematically, 10 thousand neurons can be active in 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ possible ways (0 or 1 for each input). We could enumerate and put all of them into a table (two columns, 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ rows) but even the whole universe could not store it. Alternatively, we can write the table in a compact form as some function (y=f(x)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/733/1*YKHv4Y7JMOot_27ipsYtnA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest advantage of a neuron is that it can change its inner parameters (like the weights &lt;strong&gt;w &lt;/strong&gt;in artificial neurons). Biologically, these parameters are realized as synapses between neurons, or as a distribution of ion channels on a membrane, or other molecules that determine the excitability of a cell. By changing the parameters, a neuron can change its function, its answers to 10 000 inputs. Parameters add new columns to this gigantic table and can be written as a parametric function y=f(x, w). The number of different functions the neuron can realize is called expressivity. The larger the expressivity, the more ways a neuron can integrate information. And it is crucial for learning, which is essentially a search for the right function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, people showed that the expressivity of a biological neuron is much larger than previously thought. It turns out that the dendrites do not simply transmit the signal to the center of a cell but process it along the way. If a local dendritic branch gets activated too much, it can amplify the signal (an event called a dendritic spike).Thus, synapses that are active close in space and time excite the cell much larger than simultaneous but non-local signals. This is important: read it once more. Here is a helpful picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*T7fePm4EPGdF7FizBYzeaQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left, three axons (in color) bring the activation from three neurons and spread their synapses randomly. On the right, synapses concentrate locally. The right neuron is excited more, and more likely generates an action potential (the figure shows three axons for simplicity, usually a neuron needs more to fire).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, not only the strength of a connection is important but its location. Because of this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00300/full&quot;&gt;people argued&lt;/a&gt; for a new learning paradigm: not only the weights but their locations also store information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger the dendritic tree, the more ways to arrange synapses, thus the more ways to activate the neuron and the larger the expressivity. Interestingly, evolutionary smarter animals have a larger dendritic tree. The picture below shows the pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elib.oa.edu.ua/items/show/1153&quot;&gt;source &lt;/a&gt;in Russian). Similarly, humans have more elaborate dendritic trees compared to chimpanzees (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/10/2429/295312&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Maybe, with more powerful neurons animals get higher intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*kZMZ5wS_4_uVEPbB37y4Lw.png&quot; /&gt;Pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old models of a neuron (like ReLU or threshold) are called “point” models. They do not include dendrites and are computationally weaker. Such models people still use in artificial neural networks and do not want to adopt new, more complex neurons. One of the reasons is that it’s not clear how to learn a new model with active dendrites. Another reason is that by collecting together many simple neurons you can achieve the same expressivity as a single complex neuron. So, more or less, a two-layer network corresponds to a biological neuron. Read a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/your-cortex-contains-17-billion-computers-9034e42d34f2&quot;&gt;captivating article&lt;/a&gt; that explains it in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, even this is an overly simplistic view — a real neuron is more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 3. Neurons integrate information in time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike or not to spike is the final result of all preceding computations. Still, it doesn’t simply discharge like a capacitor. The neuron remembers what happened before. Mathematically, a neuron is a complex dynamical system with time-varying parameters. Simple neuronal models can not describe all phenomena. For example, the same inputs at one time elicit activation and at another — don’t. A neuron remembers not simply a correct combination of neurons among 10 000 but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this combination occurs. As if the neuron looks over the window &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; back in time and makes a decision (0 or 1) based on (2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰)^T possible scenarios. It opens the way for remembering sequences by a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mechanism of integration across time is the control of neuronal excitability. Once a neuron becomes active from a stimulus “A” it can change its inner parameter (for example the concentration of the protein &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB&quot;&gt;CREB&lt;/a&gt;) to make itself more easily activated in the future. Even after many hours, this neuron will be activated from another stimulus “B” with a higher probability. One neuron gets activated for two stimuli and links them together. Since the memory is stored distributed across many neurons there will be an overlapping population of cells that stored a causal relationship “A-&amp;gt;B” . Changing neuronal excitability may be the way we form episodic memory (here is a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069162.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190069162-e-7&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*mo81zqIUIPg3rqjSSVSqVg.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism is when a neuron stores sequential information in other neurons. Active neurons excite other cells and shape a particular network activity (called the “context”). After a certain time, the context may cause the activation of some other neuron. This neuron encodes the previous history (a sequence) that shaped that context. This is the domain of recurrent neural networks in which it is extremely hard to unravel the chain of computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*2CRtXL1zUu2SJLG3pnV8YQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another way how a neuron preserves memory is via its spines, the places where axons attach the dendrites. They also have inner parameters that can be changed to store information. One hypothesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_tagging&quot;&gt;synaptic tagging&lt;/a&gt;) proposes that spines “remember” the previous activation by expressing some tag. Later, the activation of a synapse interferes with the tag, which makes the connection stronger. That is why sometimes people argue for learning of different time scales (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Some parameters can change quickly in response to rapid events. And some change very slowly, reflecting things happening over minutes, hours and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson is — the neurons are very variable. They can change themselves (ion channels, spines, other proteins…) to record the spatial and temporal activation of the network overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 4. Neurons learn … to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron is a living cell, and like any other it has needs. It consumes a lot of energy to fire electrical pulses. This energy must come from somewhere. Here neurons receive help from astrocytes, supportive glial cells, that live close to neurons, with around one astrocyte for three neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes sense when the neuron becomes active and change the permeability of blood capillaries to increase the flow of oxygen and glucose. These molecules are consumed by neuronal mitochondria that stores energy in the molecule ATP. Once, I had an Aha moment: “The goal of a neuron to become active to get nutrients. It activates and learns to survive!” Subsequently, I did not find any facts that support or reject this idea (that neuronal activity is the only way to get “food”). But the idea is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another similar and verified idea is homeostasis: a neuron sustains a target level of firing. If the activity exceeds or falls under the target level, the neuron launches the mechanics to return to this level. For example, a neuron can strengthen or weaken its connections (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_scaling&quot;&gt;synaptic scaling&lt;/a&gt;) or change its threshold for firing an action potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea is that to be active just enough neurons change not only themselves, but try to change other neurons. They compete and cooperate with each other. A neuron tries to become active and prevent its neighbors from firing, a process called “winner takes all”. Or neurons try to “help” other distant neurons by activating them (hoping they will return the favour sometime). Of course, it is just a story where neurons, like warriors on a battlefield, survive, fight, create alliances. Nevertheless, it helps to link many experimental facts. Neurons indeed can activate local inhibitory cells that in turn decrease activation of other local neurons (“competition”). In addition, neurons in the visual cortex create distant connections with other neurons that encode similar stimuli (“cooperation”). Still, to confirm the story many experiments need to be done. And hopefully we will answer one of the most important questions in learning — how neurons choose with whom to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that a neuron tracks the combinations among 10 000 connected neurons. Actually, it learns to recognize among 100,000 neurons. If two neurons are not connected but the axon of the first is close to the dendrite of a second, a connection may arise. It is structural plasticity — the creation and deletion of connections. A typical neuron in the neocortex has approximately 100,000 potential candidates to form the connection. What a possibility to reshape the network!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity is prominent especially in children, who have a lot of excessive synapses. With aging (till around 30 years) the connections are pruned and the most valuable remain. The speed of this process varies in different brain regions: in some, like the parietal and frontal cortex, it takes longer to fully mature. But how to choose which connections to delete? One of the answers is the principle “use it or lose it”. Connections that are used rarely get eliminated. It is a highly selective procedure — one axon may climb to a particular neuron avoiding everyone else on its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many theories of synaptic plasticity explain the changing of the strength of connections. Still, it is not completely clear how precise this strength might be. In artificial neural networks, the weight is a real number, for instance, 0.63737. True, neuronal spines vary in shape and size and a neuron can change the number and effectiveness of ion channels through which the positive ions pass and excite it ( ehh, I have to skip so many fascinating details). &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778&quot;&gt;Some estimates&lt;/a&gt; show that a synapse can store 4.7 bits of information, so it has 2^(4.7)=26 different states. Hence, learning is the change from one state to another. However, it is still debatable how long and how reliably the spine can remain in a given state. At least, we can treat the spine as one bit of information: are the two neurons connected? (And a couple more bits for the location of the synapse on a dendrite).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 5. Neurons make errors and it’s okay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, synapses are very unreliable and stochastic. Often, neurons fail to transmit the signal, neurotransmitters may be “stuck” inside the axon. The successful transmission happens with some probability. That is why it is hard to reason about the strength of the connection. Interestingly, it may be not the weakness of evolution that could not invent reliable wires, but the discovery of how to make learning more efficient. Some theories suggest that stochastic connections may actually help. Neurons in some animals can change the probability of synaptic release as a way of learning (see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2634&quot;&gt;good review&lt;/a&gt;). How common is this phenomenon in the human brain? How important is it computationally? We don’t know. New research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just synapses, but neurons can be noisy as well. Sometimes they can even die. In some brain regions the death of neurons is very bad. Like in the brain stem where neurons control breathing, blood pressure, and sustain life. However, in most regions neurons might die and nothing terrible will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the loss of some transistors could damage the whole chip and the computer stops working. Brain architecture is evolved to be stable to errors, to failure of neurons and synapses. Information is encoded in a large population of neurons, from multiple modalities (vision, hearing…). Thus, there is no grandmother neuron, the neuron that encodes only the grandmother. Otherwise, when that neuron dies — the memory is lost. One neuron does not encode only one stimulus but many. One memory is encoded in many neurons. If some cells make errors, no worries, the information remains. In case of massive cell death, like in a stroke, a function of the neurons might weaken, but later neuroplasticity reassigns the overload among other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an important principle: if you build AI with brain-like neuronal networks, you must ask yourself “will my algorithm still work if I remove 10% of neurons? Or 20%?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, this was not a complete list of all principles. But these five are among the most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you will remember that a neuron is a living cell. It doesn’t care about information processing and computation, it just wants to survive. Yet, it is fascinating that, while surviving, a neuron makes computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6bce9fc81f1f&quot;&gt;Mark Humphries&lt;/a&gt; for suggestions and saving this article from a grammatical mess :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow on: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ai.territory&quot;&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AiTerritory&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth article in the blog series “AI Territory”.

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Imagining a Transformed Scientific Publication Landscape</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18605</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/iKO_nh8kZdA/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open Science is not a finish line, but rather a means to an end. An underlying goal behind the movement towards Open Science is to conduct and publish more reliable and thoroughly reported research. Increasing the transparency, reusability and connectivity of scientific outputs is a common desire shared among publishers and researchers, but progress can seem slow and implementation far from widespread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akin to how scientific understanding is often achieved through incremental progress, system-wide changes toward Open Science will only be achieved through earnest collaboration among funders, institutions, publishers and researchers. Looking at both pragmatic solutions and the underlying ideals, we imagine changes to scientific publishing in the context of four fundamental functions that publishers should provide: dissemination, verification, recognition and community building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dissemination&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can the future provide more usable, accessible and relevant dissemination? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “research article” is largely used as a catch-all for published discoveries. A research article is typically consumed as a static PDF that’s sent to publishers after results have been accrued and conclusions drawn. Readers must wait until the study is complete and the associated paper published before they can access the methodology, which may have been finalized months or years prior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the research article into more digestible and structured parts—or modules—can provide researchers with more opportunities to reuse and improve research. Incomplete reporting of methods in traditional articles can prevent research from being reused or reproduced. More opportunities to publish detailed and enhanced methods are the two article types coming soon to &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols and Study Protocols&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab Protocols, developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, share the step-by-step instructions for verified methodologies and computational techniques. Utilizing the specialised features of protocols.io’s platform in conjunction with a peer-reviewed article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; that contextualizes the presented methodology, Lab Protocols will provide readers with the information needed to replicate a validated method in a precise and accessible format. Study Protocols are open for planned research studies, giving readers an opportunity to see design and analysis plans and helping reduce waste and bias in research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the future, studies should be presented as a collection of interlinked research objects and associated metadata. Data, code, protocols, and other elements such as reagents can all be independently identified and verified, allowing for readers to more easily find and access the elements most relevant to them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Verification&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can widespread adoption of Open Science provide more reliable and reproducible research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test for the reporting and validity of a study is whether it can be fully reproduced by different researchers. The materials used, the steps of the methods and the experimental conditions must be precisely described for a study to be reproducible. Reproduction of previous research can be a jumping-off point for contemporary researchers that leads to new discoveries. In short, proper reporting helps advance the field and accelerate further discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On platforms such as protocols.io, researchers can verify if published protocols work for them. Alongside participating researchers, publishers are important in the verification of publications by organising peer review, which can be customised for different research outputs. For Lab Protocols, &lt;em&gt;PLOS&lt;/em&gt; will be organizing peer review of submitted manuscripts and content hosted on protocols.io: a small step toward extending the value publishers can offer in verifying the validity of research and improving trust in new research formats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency enables verification. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;Preregistration&lt;/a&gt; enables interrogation of what was planned and what was carried out, and publishing peer reviews and preprints allow readers to view changes that occur during peer review. Direct links to deposited data and executable code gives an opportunity to work with the same material as the original authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having these elements—protocols, data, code, review history—available and linked to research articles reduces dependencies on the original authors of a study, promoting efficiency. A study that can be replicated with available and easy-to-find information allows the research to be usable far in the future. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can reward and incentive systems be improved to provide researchers with credit for more of their research? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perceived success of a researcher has traditionally been dependent on the credit they receive through publications. Career advancement and other rewards can be determined by how research outputs are valued and recognized, and thus recognizing diverse and more granular research contributions beyond publications is essential for researchers to be rewarded for their work appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CRediT—required by all PLOS authors and publications—offers a more nuanced view of authorship and contributorship. By providing new opportunities for peer-reviewed publications that reward critical but sometimes overlooked contributions, such as a methods development, publishers can provide opportunities for diverse elements of the research process to be better recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed protocols give authors a formal publication that enables their methods to be cited, shared and used as a signal of accomplishment. Similar opportunities exist for sharing, describing and citing research datasets and software, which need to be more widely adopted by the wider scientific community, furthering chances for additional recognition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Publishers are just part of the solution. Institutions and funders can work with publishers to recognise and reward researchers for working transparently and reproducibly. Researchers can benefit personally from presenting their research in open, reusable formats as this can drive collaboration and reuse—and can consider Open Science principles when assessing studies by their peers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Community Building&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can Open Science provide more opportunities to collaborate and connect? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has made great progress in making Coronavirus research as Open as possible. With authors across disciplines depositing their articles as preprints and publishers making relevant research fully accessible, the benefits of Open Science have been made even clearer. By connecting researchers through peer review and providing structures to make relevant research shareable and accessible without barriers, journals help researchers build and maintain their communities. The role journals have in supporting these communities will continue to evolve as innovative new ways for researchers to collaborate and connect develop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these sweeping changes have helped improve scientific discovery in a period of global need, they could be adopted in other areas of research. Comprehensive commitment to Open Science requires the full scientific community, as publishers alone cannot persuade such practices to be adopted. For research to be more efficiently disseminated, verified and credited, system-wide changes toward Open Access must be embraced across the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Revisiting the management of term breech presentation: overcoming controversy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12226</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/01/12/revisiting-the-management-of-term-breech-presentation-overcoming-controversy/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent publications have focused excessively on the mode of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go beyond the sole question of the mode of delivery, an ontological approach was applied to understand the observation of perinatal morbidity. Indeed, unmeasured fetal and maternal factors can at least partly explain the breech delivery dilemma (planned cesarean section or trial of labor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the unresolved questions?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the weakness of a unique randomized trial, nor the imperfection of the older observational population based studies could clearly help explain the observed increase of perinatal morbidity with breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors argue that planned cesarean section may decrease perinatal morbidity. However, this argument does not take into account potential complications for subsequent pregnancies and the maternal choice to avoid a cesarean section, especially in favorable cases of breech vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, planned vaginal delivery could also be harmful and potentially unethical in unselected women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we identify a need for an individualized approach to the management of term breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12235&quot; style=&quot;width: 570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12235&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: The complex puzzle of breech presentation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deterministic or accidental breech presentation? &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several recent population-based data studies reported that breech presentation was associated with prenatal factors that could also be related to maternal and/or perinatal morbidity and mortality. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetal : fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, congenital fetal malformation, unknown breech presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternal : gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a history of CS, congenital uterine malformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with the greater risk of term antepartum stillbirth in breech presentation as compared to cephalic presentation (2-2.5‰ versus 0.5-1.5‰)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points highlight the importance of screening for breech presentation of pregnancy at and beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy as well as estimating fetal weight (restriction or overgrowth) and well-being in cases of persistent breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strict selection for favorable attempt breech delivery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most national guidelines now (American, British, French, Australian and New-Zealand) propose comparable pre-established criteria for a careful selection of favorable cases for breech vaginal delivery, allowing an informed maternal choice. In contrast, without such strict selection, intrapartum cesarean section accounts for a greater proportion of maternal and perinatal morbidity and maternal morbidity than planned vaginal / cesarean delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, national guidelines and criteria for the management of term breech presentation should include: obstetric history, estimated fetal weight &amp;lt;3,800 g, non-hyper extended head on ultrasound, no evidence of antenatal fetal compromise and adequate mother pelvic size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of pelvimetry remains a matter of debate, recent studies confirmed findings of an older randomized trial suggesting that adequate pelvic size measurement may improve the selection of delivery route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence register studies support this view of a selection quality for candidate to vaginal breech delivery by the low conversion rate of vaginal to CS breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How might we maximize patient benefit from a safe external cephalic version attempt?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current guidelines recommended external cephalic version (ECV) to limit the increase in elective CS rate for cases of term breech presentation. The true impact of ECV may first be limited by the timely detection of breech presentation and contraindications. Such screening should allow timely ECV at 36 weeks’ gestation and a careful evaluation of potential underlying antenatal risks, considering obstetric history, estimated fetal weight/growth and potential gestational disorders before ECV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, pregnancy with obstetrical factors (such as GDM) and fetal factors (such as footling breech or SGA), may particularly benefit from successful ECV at 36 weeks to avoid subsequent induction of labor with breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective population based studies also highlighted that successful ECV for breech presentation are at increased risk for CS delivery, as compared with spontaneous cephalic presentation. Therefore, practitioners should understand that successful ECV is not the end of breech presentation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Towards an individualized approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mode of delivery and breech presentation is only the tip of the iceberg (fig 2). It implies that planned cesarean section without understanding the underlying obstetrical condition cannot fully prevent increased perinatal morbidity associated with breech presentation. It also means that without strict selection, the higher perinatal morbidity after planned ECV and vaginal delivery suggested by some studies (as opposed to planned cesarean section) may become a .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 36 weeks of pregnancy, one must thoroughly consider obstetric history and fetal weight estimates based on clinical and ultrasound examinations, despite the large confidence interval of all available algorithms for producing such estimates, we advise that pelvic examination should be performed. Although radiologic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pelvimetry is not universally recommended, its contribution provides very useful criteria to rule out pathological pelvic contraction for the preselection of planned modes of delivery and the counselling of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, timely ECV should be proposed in light of the eligibility and possible benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of the health care team/ availability of clinical skills is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, regardless of the planned mode of delivery, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy is needed and subject to decision-making based on the continuous evaluation of risk factors, medical history, possible underlying disorders and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new project, by any means, rather one of my long-running favorite projects – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;. INCF has partcipated each year since 2011, and I have been the main org admin on ONCF’s behalf for all but the two first years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I described GSoC in some detail in Swedish back in 2014 when I guest-blogged at Tidningen Curie (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidningencurie.se/gastbloggar/malinsandstrom/en-snart-passerad-sommar-av-kod/&quot;&gt;“En snart passerad sommar av kod”&lt;/a&gt;). Many of the things I named as positive then are still true today;  it is in many ways a &lt;em&gt;fantastically&lt;/em&gt; fun project to work with. The students are smart, motivated and enthusiastic over having the possibility to contribute to projects and tools that are needed and useful.  The mentors get a lot of development done for the price of regular mentoring, and the projects get new contributors – many continue to involve their students one way or another after the paid period, and some of them come back as mentors for the same project they started on. One former student, from 2018,  is even my co-org-admin! (Hi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arnab1896.github.io/&quot;&gt;Arnab&lt;/a&gt;!) As mentoring organization, we get the joyous task of helping our community members help each other; many of the participating software tool projects are developed an maintained on small or no funds by the researchers themselves. We know how many small gaps there are that need to be bridged to make community tools better, faster, and smarter. And all the developed and inproved resources are openly accessible for everyone to pick up and continue working on or extend. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;January, now,  is the run up period – we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurostars.org/t/incf-call-for-community-project-proposals-and-mentors-for-gsoc-2021-deadline-for-expressions-of-interest-january-15/17865&quot;&gt;a call out for project suggestions and mentors&lt;/a&gt;, and responses have just started trickling in. Usually the mentors/project owners come to us with specific, well-thought-out and well described ideas, and sitting at the other end reading them all is a great experience – it is a veritable fountain of scientific and technical creativity, and one of the high points of my year. Projects that are well scoped and described – nearly all the submissions – end up on our official Project Ideas List and form the most important part of our application (I think, nobody knows exactly what Google looks for). As soon as that list goes public, around the end of January/start of February, mentors start interacting with potential students, working out the students’ project proposals. But slowly. The real explosion in activity comes when Google announces the year’s accepted organizations, this year that announcement goes out on March 9 (usually pretty late in the day, since it is on US-compatible time). It is always a very nervous day.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, Google has reshaped the program a bit, shortening the time spent coding and lowering the (high) threshold for participation. Which means we will get more students who are not hard core coders (yet) and need some support – which we as mentoring organization will be partly responsible for providing – and also the mentors and their community – all student projects start with an official community bonding period (genius idea). I distinctly remember being new to coding as a student, and hope that experience will help me be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems I have a lot going on this coming year, I was a bit surprised myself when I started counting out my projects and landed at 9 long before I was done. Here is a status update:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1684&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #1: social media critique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the book, digital now and paper on the way, but have not started yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/30/2021-projects-2-veganuary/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #2: Veganuary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going well so far; veganizing breakfast was easy, quick work-from-home lunches depend mostly on what we ate the days before so they will veganize themselves in time. Dinner requires more adjustment, since I have two kids – relativley open to eating new things, but one of them is probably a supertaster. Most of my #veganuary updates will be posted on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1697&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #3: test-knit a cardigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also going well, I have the yoke almost done. The only annoyance is my cable keeps unscrewing from the right hand needle, regardless of how hard I screw it stuck. Again and again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-4-learn-something-new/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #4: learn something new&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project hit an unanticipated rock in the road – the Swedish AI course I joined, “Elements of AI”  in Swedish translation, which looked good at the start, turned out to be a disappointment. Weirdly formulated  problem statements – I supposed they aimed to be inclusive give simple questions, but missed the mark – and finnicky automated-response-checkers. Translation was great, though. The only term not well translated was Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-5-community-managers-resilience/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #5: community managers &amp;amp; resilience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Community managers at large have been a positive force for good, this year. In late January, there will be a Community Manager Appreciation Day, themed “resilience”. Expect some posts on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-6-scouting-leadership/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #6: scouting &amp;amp; leadership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We joined in late November, so the only scout meetings we have had so far took place on Zoom. But there are plans to be outside and DO things, which I look much forward to. And I am psyched to be a parent-leader; I have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many ideas for keeping the kids busy and entertained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #7: books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the most work, likely. All books in the apartment need to get sorted, a fair amount will be packed in boxes, and the equal amount of books will come up from the cellar storage. All books to be scanned and registered. And I need to go through, sort and tag all my 700 e-books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #8: podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project, I think, will be a main contributor to keeping me sane. I plan to take long walks and listen to interesting things. I have already found a few new favourites to add to my listening rota (which so far is mainly EscapePod): the ORIONScience podcast, and the Svenskan i Samhället (Swedish in Society) podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far not my only upcoming work project. There will be Google Summer of Code, there will be INCF Working Groups, and literature search for the INCF Infrastructure Committee. And meeting new people, helping some people connect and collaborate… I will likely not have a boring moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Malin Sandström's blog: 2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything</title>

	<link>https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This project is work-focused, but will surely frame my thinking and actions also beyond work. My latest work strategy meeting can pretty much be summed up in one sentence: RRIDs on &lt;em&gt;everythin&lt;/em&gt;g (and if it doesn’t have an RRID yet, get one for it).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RRID is short for Research Resource ID, and is a type of identifier to inambiguously identify, mention and cite a research resource, taken broadly. Web portals, software tools, antibodies, cell/animal lines or bacterial strains. RRIDs grew out of the Research Resource Identification Initiative, whose key members also are part of the INCF community in the US, ands was launched as a recommendation in 2014, re-emphasized by successful trial results published in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have ever experienced an everyday name or identity collision – a similarly named classmate, a repeatedly mis-dialed phone number, getting emails meant for another person, having a neighbour or office colleague who gets your mail and you get theirs – you should already have a hunch about why identifiers are important, and what not having them means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, identifiers give us a way to be more specific and precise than mere words can offer. There are existing identifiers for research papers (DOI:s, since old, ~2000s), people (ORCID:s, even older, Oct 2012), and research institutions (ROR in 2019, GRID in 2015). And since even longer, books have identifiers. ISBN, the International Standard Book Number, was published in &lt;strong&gt;1970&lt;/strong&gt; as international standard ISO 2108. And identifiers typically are compact strings of characters, put together after a pattern, because you want them to be easy to use AND computer-readable .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the existing set of identifiers did not cover all of research nearly enough: there were (and are still) problems with, for example: exactly and unambigously stating which antibod(ies) from which producer(s) you actually used. Or which breed of lab rat. Citing tools and specifying transparently which tools you use. Hence, RRIDs were conceived, and there is an ongoing campaign to get them broadly used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identifiers are useful on their own, but there are broader aspects – if you want to make science FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Internoperable, Reusable), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dint_a_00025&quot;&gt;identifiers will be a part of your toolset&lt;/a&gt;. They also need to be machine readable, because computers deal with thousands of data points a lot better than most humans do, and it would be nice to be able to automate identification and information gathering. They need to be persistent, i.e stay the same and not start meaning something different regardless of how tech develops. They also need to be resolveable – there needs to be a service at the other end, likely a database – storing the associated info.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea is, if everything has an RRID, it doesn’t matter if information is spread out like a box of dropped tooth picks all over the formal and informal scientific digital landscape in preprints, papers, posters, websites, blog posts, social media – it is still findable, as long as it is digital, attached to a PID, and available for indexing. So my mission is, simply, to find out which important-to-neuroinformatics research objects are not yet findable, and change that.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/2020-08-18-12_33_22-Word-Cloud-Generator-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05905-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;The micropolitics of implementation; a qualitative study exploring the impact of power, authority, and influence when implementing change in healthcare teams&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How can healthcare implementation be understood through a political lens?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A study by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rogers et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. explored the effect of micropolitics, the use of power, authority, and influence, on implementation processes in the healthcare context. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare teams, healthcare professionals have discipline-specific priorities and expectations. Thus, multidisciplinary teams must reach agreements in spite of their divergent organizational priorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Rogers et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. sought to address how micropolitics influences implementation processes by utilizing a multiple case study design and a theoretical framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12230 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/micropolitics-of-healthcare-300x156.jpg&quot; width=&quot;707&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The qualitative analysis revealed that implementing change is an inherently political process in the healthcare context. Hierarchical systems were exemplified in both case studies; however, the impact of the hierarchy differed across settings. The first theme of the micropolitics of implementation was utilizing the hierarchy to exert influence. The physicians were identified as important “role models” in implementing change. Senior managers served similarly to senior physicians, though their role was perceived to have less influence on staff engagement. Additionally, clinical nurse managers played an important role as the “middle-man” to liaise between the disciplines. In one instance, the clinical nurse manager’s rejection of the intervention led to a lack of information amongst the team, negatively impacting implementation. In each instance, the hierarchy structure impacted how team members related to the intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately le&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The second theme that emerged was how traditional power structures constrained implementation. Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately leading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention. Furthermore, the hierarchy of the team impacted how the staff viewed the intervention relating to their influence on the decision. While some staff felt the intervention offered them an opportunity to participate as members of the team and to “have a voice”, which led to more consistent attendance throughout implementation, other members felt the implementation was irrelevant to their role, resulting in poor adoption of the intervention. Finally, silo working, or working in isolation rather than collaboration, negatively affected the dissemination of information within the medical team, limiting engagement. Th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;us, the hierarchy also impacted cross-disciplinary interactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These findings ultimately apply the micropolitical concepts of power, authority and influence to the healthcare context in hopes of providing insight on how to develop more appropriate implementation strategies. The thematic analysis and knowledge of the “everyday politics” of healthcare will certainly help develop a framework for successful implementation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05915-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Defining culturally safe primary care for people who use substances: a participatory concept mapping study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the midst of the global opioid crisis, developing safe care parameters for people who use substances is essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Urbanoski et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. conducted focus groups with a variety of individuals who use or used substances, focusing on the patient perspective of safe primary care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Participants were recruited from peer-run organizations that provide support and advocacy to people who use substances. Participants were an average of 42.5 years, half identified as female and one quarter as Indigenous. Following several rounds of focus groups focused around the statement “I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”, the participants produced a cluster map as a “comprehensive and meaningful” representation of the data. The clusters can be summarized as the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Act to prevent stigma: Don’t treat me like crap!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; This cluster deals with the external and internal stigma associated with substance use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hey I’m human. Treat me right!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Similar to Cluster 1, this cluster reflects the importance of humane and compassionate care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Uphold professional standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Cluster 3 primarily focuses on professional competency, particularly around pain management and how providers can recognize patients’ experience of pain as legitimate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you care about me? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How can physicians develop trust with their patients? This cluster speaks to the importance of personalized care, continuity of care, and developing rapport. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maintain my confidentiality in a welcoming and comfortable environment&lt;/i&gt;. Cluster 5 articulates concerns around the waiting room environment and clinic practices. Participants described crowded waiting rooms and limited privacy in conversation as chief stressors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be a champion for advocacy&lt;/i&gt;. How can primary care providers address issues of accessibility and support to improve perceived safety in accessing care? Cluster 6 states examples such as allowing the presence of advocates or friends at appointments, providing care in discrete locations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acknowledge and accommodate my needs and circumstances&lt;/i&gt;. Cluster 7 identifies how circumstances impact plans of care. Participants indicated the desire for increased forgiveness of missed appointments, understanding fear of being criminalized for the disclosure of drug use, and more. Each of these statements asked primary care providers to recognize the “structural conditions” that impact accessing healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don’t red flag me: Recognize addiction as a health issue&lt;/i&gt;. The final cluster addresses how a physician’s view of addiction as a health issue, not a criminal behavior, helps people who use substances feel safe in seeking care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, these focus groups provide a starting point for improving the delivery of compassionate primary care to people who use substances. This model provides concrete, patient-centered suggestions for improving primary care processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;BMC Endocrine Disorders  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-020-00649-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Impact of malnutrition on systemic immune and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nutrition has a large impact for diabetes patients and can be linked to managing the condition. Typically associated with overweight or obese patients, this condition is being tracked within malnourished populations and how it affects the individuals’ immunological and metabolic profiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that people with a low BMI, or those suffering from malnutrition, had decreased levels of glycemic, hormonal, and cytokine parameters and were therefore less likely to be able to manage Type 2 Diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Malnutrition has been linked to negatively affecting the immunology of a patient and increasing their mortality &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;from infections. It was hypothesized that a low BMI alters the pancreatic hormone, adipocytokine, and cytokines in Type 2 Diabetes patients, resulting in an increased risk for a more sever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;e form. Covering 88 participants, this study found strong links to BMI and immune response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that people with a low BMI, or those suffering from malnutrition, had decreased levels of glycemic, hormonal, and cytokine parameters and were therefore less likely to be able to manage Type 2 Diabetes. Consequently, BMI was also associated with the immunological parameters of patients, with normal BMIs having a significant positive correlation for immune response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-020-03153-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Do women who consult with naturopaths or herbalists have a healthy lifestyle?: a secondary analysis of the Australian longitudinal study on women’s health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many Australians report that they &lt;/span&gt;consult naturopaths, but what does this mean for their health?&lt;i&gt; Steel et al&lt;/i&gt;. evaluated the relationship between health behavior and consultations with naturopaths in Australian women among three age cohorts (19-25, 31-36, and 62-67).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through analyzing the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH), they found that women of all cohorts who had consulted with a naturopath in the last 12 months were less likely to smoke, more likely to report at least moderate levels of physical activity, and more likely to have a vegetarian diet. Additionally, women who had consulted with naturopaths were also more likely to have used marijuana or illicit drugs in the last 12 months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Further research is needed to understand this relationship between naturopaths and health behaviors, but this study uncovered opportunities for naturopaths to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;support health behaviors and minimize risky behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;BMC Genomics  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unjumbling contaminated DNA in ancient specimens pose issues for cost-effective sequencing and interpretation. Identifying the contamination between human and faunal DNA has the benefit of being able to affect analyses when mapping the reference genomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12229 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/woolly-mammoth-300x300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This work focuses on the most effective method to competitively map human contamination from ancient faunal DNA with reduced losses of data, thus acting as a beneficial tool within ancient DNA research. This was achieved through the sequencing of genomic data from 70 ancient and historical mammalian specimens, including an ancient favorite: the wooly mammoth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Systematic reviews are arguably the most robust form of research evidence. However, as the literature becomes continually more saturated with these reviews, it is more difficult to identify relevant reviews addressing specific questions. How can the scientific community keep up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The included reviews were selected using a machine-based approach, which were then validated by a network of over 1000 collaborators. This database is a free, multilingual, and quality-checked “one-stop shop” for systematic reviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Australia’s sexual minority adult population (LGBTQIA+) are difficult to estimate as the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not publish or collect any data on sexual identity. Therefore, this work attempted to provide this estimate and fill the gaps in the latest census data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Combining data from multiple national surveys and population data, average prevalence rate produced an estimate of Australia’s sexual minority population – utilising data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Household, Income And Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.  It was found that Australia’s sexual minority was higher in the younger population and steadily increased with surveys conducted in later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that Australia’s sexual minority was higher in the younger population and steadily increased with surveys conducted in later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Proposing a potential cohort effect for this trend, it is suggested sexual identities can be influenced by social attitudes and the legal environment of the time. Younger cohorts have spent their formative years within a time of higher acceptance of sexual identity and the willingness to disclose one’s identity. This cohort effect has the potential to impact future population surveys and the percentage of Australia’s known sexual minority population.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the informal start of our Veganuary. I went shopping for core vegan staples and a few upcoming easy meals, and we made our first vegan lunch: vegan gyros in pita bread, with oat créme fraîche, vegetables, hummus, roasted onion flakes, and vegan feta.  Everyone was postively surprised – the vegan gyros was tender and flavourful, the fraîche was to everyone’s liking, and the feta was eerily much like the original. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also discussed implementation and focus, and came to agreement: 1) major focus: sustainability and being planet friendly. No flight transports or unneccessarily long transports if local alternatives exist. 2) secondary focus: health. We might as well diversify our carbohydrates while changing things around. More beans and lentils. 3) Needs to be family compatible. The kids will sometimes get their usual fare, but will be encouraged to try alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, I aim to take a generally more planet-friendly month, focused on re-use and DIY, aiming for second hand and pre-used where available. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier this year I was invited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/62408&quot;&gt;discuss&lt;/a&gt; with Georgia Institute of Technology librarian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://library.gatech.edu/fred-rascoe&quot;&gt;Fred Rascoe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/11/open-access-could-defeat-be-snatched.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;eBook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “Open access: Could defeat be snatched from the jaws of victory?” for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lost in the Stacks, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;research library rock and roll show &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;he hosts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7wexhMC4-nU/X8dxg0otuEI/AAAAAAAAsiY/sKL2kpdHbGIs-agT1ga3yFnsukqf5i4XgCNcBGAsYHQ/s683/Information%2Bwants%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bfree.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;455&quot; data-original-width=&quot;683&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7wexhMC4-nU/X8dxg0otuEI/AAAAAAAAsiY/sKL2kpdHbGIs-agT1ga3yFnsukqf5i4XgCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/Information%2Bwants%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bfree.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to the interview, Rascoe sent me a list of questions. As we did not have time to discuss them all during the interview, I decided to publish my answers on my blog. With the greater space available I also took the opportunity to expatiate at considerable length in doing so. This turned into another eBook!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please note that what I say in the attached document is built on an interview. It is not intended to be any kind of prediction of the future; it is more an extended reflection after 20 years reporting on the OA movement, coupled with a heavy dose of speculation. Who knows, perhaps this will be the last thing I ever write on open access. Maybe this will prove my swan song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would also like to stress upfront that in the critique of the OA movement I make I don’t claim that my knowledge, or predictions, are superior to anyone else’s. This is just what I have concluded after many years observing the movement and reflects my current view on where I think we are today. It does also include a lot of factual data, as well as links and footnotes for those who like them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importantly, while I do not consider myself to be an OA advocate, I admit that I was as naïve as anyone else about what the movement might be able to achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, while what I say might be slightly overweight in European developments, it may not matter if (as I believe is possible) events in Europe end up determining how open access develops globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I say this because it seems possible that European OA initiatives will reconfigure the international scholarly communication system, and in ways that OA advocates will not be comfortable with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would add that the main focus is on science publishing rather than HSS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;To read/download my new eBook please click &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/information-wants-to-be-free_20210101/mode/2up&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The file can also be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Information_Wants_to_be_Free.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Annual report of my intuition about the brain (2020)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/?p=6687</guid>
	<link>https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does the brain work and how can we understand it? I want to make it a habit to report some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month at the end of each year – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications. Enjoy the read! And check out previous year-end write-ups: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doing experiments in neuroscience means opening Pandora’s box. On a daily basis, you’re confronted with the vexing fact that the outcome of experiments is not only slightly, but much more complex and variable than any mental model you could come up with. It is rewarding and soothing to read published stories about scientific findings, but they often become stories only because things which did not fit in were omitted or glossed over. This is understandable to some extent, since nobody wants to read 379 side-notes on anecdotal and potentially confusing observations. But it leads to a striking gap between headlines with clear messages, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by complexity when doing experiments or going through a raw dataset. It is possible to overcome this complexity by nested analysis pipelines (‘source’ extraction, unsupervised clustering, inclusion criteria, dimensionality reduction, etc.) and to restore simplicity. But the confusion often comes back when going back to the raw, unreduced data, because they contain so much more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this year’s write-up, I want to address this complexity of the brain from the perspective of self-organized systems, and I will try to point out lines of research that can, in my opinion, contribute to an understanding of these systems in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complex systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I have been writing about the limitation of the human mind to deal with the brain’s complexity, and the reasons behind this limitations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/entanglement-of-temporal-and-spatial-scales-in-the-brain-but-not-in-the-mind/&quot;&gt;Entanglement of temporal and spatial scales in the brain but not in the mind&lt;/a&gt;). This year, I again have been thinking quite a bit about these issues. During summer, in the bookshelf of a friend, I noticed the novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel)&quot;&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/a&gt;, which my friend, to my surprise, recommended to me. The book, more so than the movie, tells the story of how a complex system – the Jurassic Park – cannot be controlled because of unexpected interactions within the system that were thought to be separated by design. This perspective is represented in the book by a smart-ass physicist who had worked on chaos theory. He not only predicts that all will be going downhill from the start, but also provides lengthy rants about the hubris of men who think they can control complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This threw me back to the days when I studied physics myself, actually also with a focus on complex systems: non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, chaos control and biophysics. So, with some years in neuroscience behind me, I went back to the theory of complex systems. I started to go through a very easy-to-read book on the topic by Melanie Mitchell: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/2/reviews/3.html&quot;&gt;Complexity: A Guided Tour&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://melaniemitchell.me/&quot;&gt;Melanie Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; is herself a researcher in complexity science. She did her PhD work with Douglas Hofstadter, famously known for his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach&quot;&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell summarizes the history and ideas of her field in a refreshingly modest and self-critical way, which I can only recommend. As another bonus point, the book was published in 2009, just before deep learning emerged as a highly dominant idea – which also suppressed and overshadowed many other interesting lines of thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6701&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6701&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;mitchell&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3956,2432&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/mitchell/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, Mitchell brings up John von Neumann’s idea of self-organization in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton&quot;&gt;cellular automata&lt;/a&gt;, Douglas Hofstadter’s work, Alan Turing’s idea of self-organization in simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern&quot;&gt;reaction-diffusion systems&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine&quot;&gt;cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; movement around Norbert Wiener, Hermann Haken’s concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/a&gt;, and Stephen Wolfram’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science&quot;&gt;A New Kind of Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of these ideas about complex systems were intellectually inspiring, and certainly influenced many people; but at the same time they often did not really hold their promise and did not have a similar real-work impact outside of the philosophical realm, in contrast to for example the development of semiconductors or the backpropagation in neuronal networks. On one side, ideas around self-organization like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis&quot;&gt;Autopoiesis&lt;/a&gt; concept invented by Montana and Varela were riddled with ill-defined concepts and often connected to ideas like “emergence”, “cognition” or “consciousness” in very vague ways. On the other side of the spectrum, many very influential researchers like Douglas Hofstadter or Stephen Wolfram had a very strong mathematical background and therefore were fascinated by beauty and simplicity rather than truely high-dimensional chaos. I think it’s fascinating to proof that a cellular automaton like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&quot;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; is Turing-complete (i.e., it is a universal computer), but wouldn’t a practical application of such an automaton be more convincing and useful than a theoretical proof?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is therefore tempting for an experimentalist and natural scientist to simply trash the entire field as verbal acrobatics that will not help to understand complex systems like the brain. However, in the next section I’d like to make the point why I think the concept of self-organized systems should still be considered as potentially central when it comes to understanding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-organized systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the last years, I have become more and more convinced that complex systems cannot be easily understood by simply describing their behavior. Even for very simple complex phenomena like the Lorenz equations, where the behavior of the system can be described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor&quot;&gt;strange attractors&lt;/a&gt;, this description can only provide a low-dimensional description which allows to predict the behavior of the system, but it does not tell much about the generative processes underlying the respective phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional descriptions of brain activity are one of the most active areas of current research in neuroscience. This can range from a description of brain dynamics in terms of oscillatory regimes, to default mode networks of the human brain, or more recently to attempts to break down the population activity of thousands of neurons into a low-dimensional manifold. These are beautiful  descriptions of neuronal activities, and it is certainly useful to study the brain with these approaches. But does it provide us with a real understanding? From one perspective, one could say that such a condensed description (if it exists, which is not yet clear) would be a form of deep understanding, since any way to compress a description is some sort of understanding. But I think there should be a deeper way of understanding that focuses on the underlying generative processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to understand artificial neural networks (deep networks). One way would be to investigate information flows and how representations of the input evolve across different layers and become less similar to the input and more similar to the respective target label. This is an operative and valuable way to understand of what is going on. In my opinion, it would however allow for a deeper understanding to simply bring up the very organizing principles which underlie the generation of the network: back-propagation of errors during learning, the definition of the loss function and the deep feed-forward network architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I think it would be equally more interesting in neuroscience to understand the generative and organizing principles which underlie the final structure of the brain, instead of studying the representations of information in neuronal activity. It is clear that a part of the organization of the brain is encoded in the genome, for example as guidance cues for axonal growth or as the program of sequential migration of cell types, and in addition also the coarse specific connectivity across different cell types. However, the more flexible, and possibly also more interesting part, is probably not organized by an external designer (like a deep network) and also not directly organized by the genome. In the absence of an external designing instance, there must be self-organization at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once we accept that this part of the generative principles underlying the brain structure and function is self-organization, it becomes immediately clear that it might be useful to get inspired by complexity science and the study of self-organized systems. This connection between neuroscience is probably evident to anybody working on complex systems, but I have the impression that this perspective is sometimes lost by systems neuroscience and in particular experimental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-organizing principles of neuronal networks: properties of single neurons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe that the most relevant building blocks of self-organization in the brain are single neurons (and not molecules, synapses or brain areas). A year ago, I have argued why I think this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/&quot;&gt;Annual report of my intuition about the brain (2019)&lt;/a&gt;), and I argued why would be interesting to understand the objective function of a single cell: so-to-speak the single-cell specific generative principle that underlies the self-organization of biological neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Realistically speaking, this is too abstract a way of exploring biological neurons. What would be a less condensed way to describe the self-organizing principles underlying single neurons that are analogous to back-propagation and loss functions for deep networks? I would tend to mention main ingredients: First, the principles that determine the integration of inputs in a single neuron. Second, the principles that determine the way that neurons connect and modify their mutual connections – which is basically nothing but plasticity rules between neurons. I am convinced that the integrative properties of neurons and the plasticity rules of a neuron when interacting with other cells are the main ingredients that are together the self-organizing principles of neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat underwhelming conclusion, because both plasticity rules and integrative properties of neurons have been studied very intensely since the 1990s. The detour of this blog post about self-organization basically reframes what a certain branch of neuroscience has been studying anyway. However, in addition it makes – in my opinion – also clear why the study of population dynamics and low-dimensional descriptions of neuronal activity aims at a different level of understanding. And it makes the point that the deepest understanding of biosimilar networks can probably be achieved by studying the aspects of self-organizing agents, plasticity rules and single-cell integrative properties, and not by studying the pure behavior of animals or neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studying self-organized neuronal networks and plasticity rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how can we study these principles of self-organized agents? Unfortunately, the last 30 years have made it quite clear that there is not simply a single universal plasticity rule. Typical plasticity rules (spike-time dependent plasticity; fire-together-wire-together; NMDA-dependent potentiation) usually explain only a small fraction of the variance in the experimental data and can often be only studied in very specific experimental conditions, and in most cases only in slice work. Usually, the conditions of the experiment (number of presynaptic action potentials to induce plasticity, spike frequency, etc.) are tuned to achieve strong effects, and absence of effects in other conditions are not systematically studied and often go unreported. In addition, plasticity rules &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; seem to be somewhat different. Neuromodulation and other state-dependent influences might affect plasticity rules in ways that make them almost impossible to study systematically. In addition, it is very likely that there is not a single plasticity rule that governs the same behavior across all all neurons, since diversity of properties has been shown in simulations to provide robustness to neuronal circuits at many different levels. And evolution has would be a fool not to make use of this property that is so easy to achieve – evolution does not care about being hard to reverse engineer. This however makes it merely impossible (although still very valuable!) to dissect these principles systematically in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I think that simulations – not experiments – could be the best starting point for understanding these self-organized networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a large body of work going into this direction. If you google for “self-organizing neuronal networks”, you will find a huge literature which goes back to the 60s and is often based on very simplistic models of neurons (still heavily inspired by condensed matter physics), but there are also some interesting more recent papers that directly combine modern plasticity rules with the idea of self-organization (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.10.023.2009/full&quot;&gt;Lazar et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;). And there are not few computational labs that study plasticity rules and their effect on the organization of neuronal networks, which is also some kind of self-organization, e.g. the labs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=m0v2CxEAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Henning Sprekeler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=jy5yBV4AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Claudia Clopath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=RsHPZroAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Tim Vogels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=_IxvO8QAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Friedemann Zenke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2HXsblgAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Richard Naud&lt;/a&gt;, all of them influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=dqBH37QAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/a&gt;; or  &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Sophie Deneuve&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4z7V1oAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Christian Machens&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WpvdH0AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Wolfgang Maass&lt;/a&gt; – to name just few out of many people who work on this topic. I think this is one of the most interesting fields of theoretical neuroscience. However, I would be personally very satisfied to see this field shift towards a better inclusion of the self-organizing perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give a random example, in a study from this year, Naumann and Sprekeler show how specific non-linear properties of neurons can mitigate a well-known problem associated with purely Hebbian plasticity rules (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/12/2020.02.11.944082&quot;&gt;Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitationin the face of plasticity, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). They basically take an experimental finding that has been made quite some time ago (pre-synaptic inhibition of the axonal boutons via GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors) and builds a model that explains how this could make sense in the light of plasticity rules. This is a very valuable way of doing research, also because it takes biological details of neurons into account and gives the experimentalists a potential context and explanation of their findings. However, this approach seems to be the perspective of a designer or engineer, rather than the approach of somebody who aims at an understanding of a self-organized system. What would be an alternative approach?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From engineered organization to self-organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think it would be useful to take the perspective of a neuron, and in addition also an evolutionary perspective. Let’s say, a neuron with certain properties (rules on when and how to connect) joins the large pool of a recurrent network. The question which must be solved by the neuron is: How do I learn how to behave meaningfully?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give an analogy on how I think this neuron should ideally behave: A human person that interacts with others in a social network, be it in real life or in the virtual world, must adjust their actions according to how they are received. Shouting loud all the time will isolate them, because they are blocking the receiving channels of others, and being silent all the time will let others equally drop the connections. To adjust the level of output and to adjust the appropriate content that will be well-received, it is crucial to listen to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I think could be the central question from this self-organized perspective of neuronal circuits: How does the neuron get feedback on its own actions? And with feedback, I do not mean global error signals about the behavior of the organism via neuromodulation channels, but  feedback on the neuron’s action potentials and its other actions. Where does this feedback come from?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we reduce the complex network to a single cell, we can immediately see the answer to this question, the feedback comes from the external world. A spike of this “neuron” has a direct impact on the world, and the world in return acts back upon the “neuron”. It is not clear how this scales up to larger networks, but I think that this inclusion of the external world, as opposed to a machine learning-style input-output task, could be the most important ingredient that makes the step from engineered network organizations to self-organized networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(There are many loose connections from here to reinforcement learning using learning agents and also to predictive processing, but let’s not go into that here.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of this write-up might sound trivial from some perspective; and again others might say that these ideas will not lead anywhere, similar to many previous suggestions in the field of complex self-organized systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to become convinced otherwise, but today I think that a very promising way to achieve a deep understanding of the brain could consist of the following ingredients, as motivated above:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) To regard the brain as a at least partially self-organized network,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) To use simulations together with evolutionary algorithms to explore the generative / self-organizing principles,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) To consider properties and actions on the level of single neurons as the main parameters that can be modified during this evolutionary process and&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) To include an external world to transition from an externally organized to a self-organized system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcasts have been growing quickly in numbers during the last years, and I didn’t really clue in to that until I re-joined LinkedIn in the middle of the year for other work purposes – and suddenly, it seemed whoever I checked and followed had a podcast. Or had just started a podcast – it is apparently the Professional Thing To Do in the 2020’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, my life mostly lacks quiet time to sit down (or go for walks) and listen to podcasts, so I have been amassing an ever-growing long list of interesting, possible podcasts to listen to; it is very low effort to follow more podcasts now that they are available on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I used to listen to a lot of podcasts some years ago, when the kids were still small enough to need daily long walks in a stroller. It was mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://escapepod.org/about-us/&quot;&gt;EscapePod&lt;/a&gt; and a few different Swedish Radio pods, and a very nice podcast with some of my favourite authors chatting about different things, the &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/&quot;&gt;SFSqueecast&lt;/a&gt;,  but it ended long ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, my project for 2021 is: take the looong list of podcasts I currently subscribe to, and trial them to see which ones are worth keeping long term.  I have one nominee for the list already, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orion-openscience.eu/publications/training-materials/201902/podcasts&quot;&gt;ORION Open Science podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Malin Sandström's blog: 2021 projects, #7: books</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://malinsandstrom.blog/?p=1725</guid>
	<link>https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I own a lot of books. Nowadays, I mostly buy Kindle books, since the bookshelves had to go when we got twins. I now own about 700 books on Kindle, of which 400+ are read at least once. This is the result of one single Twitter account (mostly), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sfsignal&quot;&gt;@SFSignal&lt;/a&gt;, that tweets sales of SF and other fantastic fiction, under the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/sff_eBookDeal?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;sff_eBookDeal&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the books go for as low as $1-$2, and that’s where the majority of my digital library comes from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also own a lot of actual, physical SFF books. Nearly all paperbacks. We used to have a high shelf for my books along the walls of our entry hall, but when we switched apartments a few years back, that had to go. It swallowed at least 150 books, that now lying in boxes in the cellar storage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we started the Matmolekyler project, we started out with buying useful books. I have a bunch of those in my bookshelves (including some I got myself, or as gifts: several books by HaroldMcGee, two priced *signed* books by Gordon Shepherd). Since then, I try to buy food-science-related books when I find them at reaonable prices. That collection is now about 50 books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also went through a period where I was thinking a lot about food and cooking history, so I tried to find some of the earlier real cookbooks (and school household training books) from the early 1900s. There are typically cheap and abundant at used book stores, so by now I have quite a few. Including one I got at a museum, which is a copy of a 1800s cookbook along with a companion book written by a historian). And a set of two old ~1800s household encyclopedias in a new edition from a Swedish agricultural society (I had to order them special and pick them up in person). Let’s say, another 40 or so books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For 2021, I hope to rearrange all of our (mine, really) bookshelves so that I have more SFF books accessible (since I want to re-read them anyway). I hope to inventory and index all books, and maybe even get rid of some. I need to find some good book inventory software – I have Goodreads but haven’t really used it for sorting books yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Malin Sandström's blog: 2021 projects, #6: scouting &amp; leadership</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://malinsandstrom.blog/?p=1719</guid>
	<link>https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-6-scouting-leadership/</link>
	<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/web.cdn.scouterna.net/uploads/sites/59/2019/09/2019-07-17-114825-e1567370272989-615x820.jpg?resize=615%2C820&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; /&gt;The founder of Adolf Fredrik scoutkår, Ivar Åkerfelt.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My kids wanted to join the Scouts, so we put them in the queue for our local Scoutkår, Adolf Fredriks. Kids whose parents agree to help with (co)leading get boosted higher in the queue, and I do have earlier experience, so I indicated my willingness to help. And then we waited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not for long, it took maybe a month or so. No regular meetings were held, but we tried to meet up on Zoom each week (and if you have ever wondered why Zoom etiquette is needed, try meeting with a group of eight-year-olds and try to get them to follow a program).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no outside activities yet, but that is our likely next step, so we have gone over what outdoor equipment we have and what we need. Black Friday let us buy two good sleeping bags for a good price. The kids’ great-grandmother gave them each a good outdoor backpack. I found myself hiking boots, outdoor trousers and a decent size backpack (~50 l ) on sales. Rainjackets, -trousers and boots/waterproof shoes we already have, because of Stockholm winters. We also got two pairs of skates and helmets for the kids, because one of the possible future activities is the skating ice frozen in the nearby Vasaparken, arranged every winter season by the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So for the next year at least, I will be the co-leader of a troop of 8-year-old scouts (who will turn 9 during the year).  I have so many ideas for fun stuff to do, based on my own years in the Mjölby scoutkår at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Malin Sandström's blog: 2021 projects, #5: community managers &amp; resilience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://malinsandstrom.blog/?p=1715</guid>
	<link>https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-5-community-managers-resilience/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The CMX holiday letter states: “&lt;em&gt; I just reviewed the data with the research team and one thing is crystal clear: community has become an irreplaceable part of business. In a year where a lot of businesses struggled, and there were many layoffs, community teams actually grew. And companies of all sizes, in all industries, are going to be investing in community in a big way next year&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have a standing alert for community-related position ads on LinkedIn, and see clearly a parallell increase in community positions offered in science &amp;amp; academia.  Where ads earlier have been implicit about the community aspects, hiding it under terms such as ‘field knowledge’, nearly everyone knows and admits to some degree that in academia, it is impossible to succeed without community support. It is built into the system that your peers will (hopefully) acknowledge you and lift your work up – this mechanism is seen in such academic pillars as peer review, recommendation letters, and hiring committees, to name some examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since I did my AAAS Community Fellowship in 2017, a training program that ran twice and which has now transformed into an independent organisation called CSCCE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscce.org/&quot;&gt;Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement&lt;/a&gt; , I have been an active member in the community that surrounds CSCCE. We have a lot of interesting activites and projects around community management – interest groups (I’m in the Open Science SIG and lurking in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion SIG), projects (I’m in one we started in 2017, aiming to describe and pin down community manager skillsets), and Working Groups (I’m in the Community Champions WG).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theme for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmxhub.com/announcing-this-years-community-manager-advancement-day-theme-resilience&quot;&gt;2021 Community Manager Advancement Day&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place on January 25, is resilience. A very fitting theme, after this Covid year. Resilience of self, when the world stops around you; resilience of communities to chaos and changes; resilience of organizations and society – where community has a huge part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The brain of a monkey, mouse, marsupial, monotreme, mosquito, or mollusk? Or &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; with its 306 neurons? “Yeah yeah, we get the point,” you say, “stop being so sarcastic and cynical.

What are we trying to explain? Behavior, of course [&lt;i&gt;a very specific behavior&lt;/i&gt; most of the time]: X behavior in your model organism. But we also want to explain thought, memory, perception, emotion, neurological disorders, mental illnesses, etc. Seems daunting now, eh? Can the same core principles account for all these phenomena across species? I'll step out on a limb here and say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then snort for asking such an unfair question. Best that your research program is broken down into tiny reductionistic chunks. More manageable that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what counts as an “explanation”? We haven't answered that yet. It depends on your goal and your preferred level of analysis (à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Marr's 3 levels of analysis, from 'Vision'&quot;&gt;three levels&lt;/a&gt; of David Marr): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s320/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias&quot;&gt;Krakauer et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, what counts as “explanation”?

	<title>BRAIN Update: Congress Passes Budget Bill: NIH BRAIN Initiative Receives $60M in Additional Funds for Fiscal Year 2021</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainupdate.nih.gov/?p=2932</guid>
	<link>https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2020/12/29/congress-passes-budget-bill-nih-brain-initiative-receives-60m-in-additional-funds-for-fiscal-year-2021/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A message to the community from Dr. John Ngai, Director of the NIH BRAIN Initiative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2932&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear BRAIN Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform you that the recently authorized &lt;a href=&quot;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf&quot;&gt;Omnibus&lt;/a&gt; Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2021 provides $42.9 billion for NIH, an increase of $1.25 billion (or 1.5%) above fiscal year 2020. &lt;strong&gt;This appropriation includes $560 million for the NIH BRAIN Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;, a $60 million increase over last year’s $500 million appropriation. We are deeply grateful for Congress’s strong and continuing support of our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spending bill includes $404 million of appropriated funds authorized in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/cures&quot;&gt;21st Century Cures Act&lt;/a&gt;. The Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, allocates funding to NIH each year through 2026, for a total of $4.8 billion across all projects described in the Act. The BRAIN Initiative was one of four highly innovative scientific initiatives designated to receive multi-year funding through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research-training/initiatives/nih-cures-innovation-plan.pdf&quot;&gt;Innovation Fund of the Cures Act&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting enthusiasm for the Initiative and its goals. This funding must be appropriated each year by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $560 million appropriation for the NIH BRAIN Initiative includes $100 million in Cures Act funds. This legislation reflects strong bipartisan Congressional support for biomedical research, and will provide NIH with the resources needed to continue to work towards the goals in BRAIN’s strategic plan, which was initially outlined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRAIN 2025 report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and recently updated and enhanced through the BRAIN 2.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/bns_roadmap_11_october_2019_sent_to_acd_for_oct_2019_revised_10282019_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;neuroethics&lt;/a&gt; reports. Importantly, this generous allocation for 2021 will accelerate the launch of two transformative projects outlined in those reports that “stand out in for their importance to human health and technical viability,” specifically: $40 million for the Human Brain Cell Atlas and $20 million for the Armamentarium for Brain Cell Access. Collectively, this funding will help accelerate BRAIN’s mission to develop and apply innovative tools and neurotechnologies, as well as to support researchers as they seek new ways to treat, cure, and ultimately prevent brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increased funds for the BRAIN Initiative, the Omnibus Bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides $1.25 billion, available until September 2024, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increases funding by $300 million, to a total of $3.12 billion in fiscal year 2021, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Disorders/Alzheimers-Related-Dementias&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;includes no less than $270 million for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heal.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;HEAL Initiative&lt;/a&gt; targeted at opioid misuse and addiction, and expands the uses of these funds to include research related to stimulant misuse and addiction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;directs NIH to require its grantees to notify it when key personnel are removed for concerns of harassment, an essential step toward addressing the findings of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/sexual-harassment-in-academia&quot;&gt;2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on sexual harassment in academia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spending bill will fund the government until the end of the current fiscal year on September 30, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With gratitude and best wishes for a healthy and prosperous new year,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Ngai, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director, NIH BRAIN Initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Earlier this month, we reported on how Susanne Stoll, a graduate student in the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University College London, discovered an error that toppled a highly-cited 2014 article — and which might affect hundreds of other papers in the field of perception.

	<title>For Better Science: Omer Nour and Magnus Willander guilty of research misconduct</title>

	<description>&quot;The Board assesses that there are no scientifically acceptable explanations for why the notified researchers have fabricated research results in the manner that has occurred in the notified articles. Raw data also does not support the reported results. [..]
In summary, the Board finds therefore that the notified researchers have been guilty of misconduct in research.&quot;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Our Ten Most Popular Posts Of 2020</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/22/our-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2020/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year has been like no other. The coronavirus pandemic has affected pretty much all aspects of our lives — so it’s no surprise that psychological research looked a bit different in 2020. At &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve examined much of this emerging work on the effects of the pandemic, from studies exploring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/&quot;&gt;process of psychological recovery&lt;/a&gt; to those looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/&quot;&gt;how to cope with the new reality of home working&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we’ve also tried to continue providing the broad coverage of psychology research that our readers have come to enjoy. And as we look back at our most popular posts of the year, it’s clear these stories about the human experience continue to educate and entertain, even in the midst of this &lt;em&gt;annus horribilis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41086&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/22/heavy-coffee-drinkers-want-coffee-a-lot-more-than-they-actually-like-it/&quot;&gt;Heavy Coffee Drinkers Want Coffee A Lot More Than They Actually Like It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study has been all over the papers this month — but we first covered it way back in June. I suspect that many people’s coffee consumption has shot through the roof during the pandemic (I know mine has), so it’s perhaps not surprising that this was one of our most read pieces of the year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 9) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/&quot;&gt;Here’s How Our Personality Changes As We Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personality was once believed to be stable, changing very little after the age of 30 or so. But recent work shows that our personalities actually shift throughout our lives. This study examined how the “Big Five” personality traits of tens of thousands of people changed through middle age and into older age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/&quot;&gt;Cold Days Can Make Us Long For Social Contact — But Warming Up Our Bodies Eliminates This Desire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that temperature can affect our social perceptions — that being physically warm leads us to feel “warm” towards others — is contentious. In fact, this kind of social priming research is often at the centre of controversies about psychology’s replication crisis. But this year, a study suggested one possible explanation for the inconsistencies in past work: the researchers rarely take into account the &lt;em&gt;ambient&lt;/em&gt; temperature while they’re conducting their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/19/why-some-people-find-it-harder-to-drag-themselves-to-bed-at-night/&quot;&gt;Why Some People Find It Harder To Drag Themselves To Bed At Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why do so many of us suffer from “bedtime procrastination”? Intriguingly, it might be related to the beliefs we have about our willpower. This study found that people who think that willpower is a limited resource that needs to be replenished are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to put off going to bed on a stressful day, perhaps because they feel they need more time to recover from their day before sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our posts containing practical tips often attract a lot of readers, and this one was no different. Many lab-based studies have identified strategies for more effective studying — but this was a rare case of looking at these approaches in an actual educational setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of person decides to run 50 or 100km — or even more? Well, it turns out that ultramarathon runners are actually pretty similar to everyone else. They do seem to be more resilient and better at using certain emotion regulation strategies — but whether that’s the cause or consequence of being a long-distance runner remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the first lockdown feels like a lifetime ago now. But as the world was learning to adjust to new routines, many psychologists launched projects to study the effects of the crisis and to inform our response to it. We looked at several of these projects in this story in March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/07/psychology-research-in-the-coronavirus-era-a-high-stakes-version-of-groundhog-day/&quot;&gt;follow-up feature in July&lt;/a&gt; didn’t receive quite the same number of readers, but to my mind was more important. This time we explored the worries voiced by many researchers that in “crisis mode”, psychologists were falling for the old methodological pitfalls that the field has long been trying to move on from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cast your mind back to a time when it was possible to attend a concert, you might remember experiencing a feeling of connection with the musicians as they played. That connection can happen even at the neural level, according to a study which found “inter-brain coherence” between a musician and their audience (essentially a correlation in patterns of blood flow in the brains of performer and observer). What’s more, this synchronisation was stronger during the pieces the listeners found more enjoyable. Another study this year found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/&quot;&gt;parents also show patterns of synchrony&lt;/a&gt; with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second story about personality and age proved popular this year. In this post, we looked at a study on the link between personality and cognitive complaints in older adults. One factor stood out as predicting &lt;em&gt;fewer &lt;/em&gt;cognitive complaints: openness to experience, a trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits and a willingness to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive nature of STEM classes at university can lead many students to feel like they are an imposter — but first-generation students seem to be at particular risk of imposter syndrome. This, only the second story that we posted in 2020, clearly struck a chord: it was the most popular post of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Neuroscientifically Challenged: Know Your Brain: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">52ec8c1ae4b047ccc14d6f29:53434d26e4b038212627b036:5fce11c4c00f007cea0f3ff1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every night, Steven spends over an hour preparing for bed. For many of us, preparing for bed involves routines like putting on pajamas, going to the bathroom, and brushing our teeth. But for Steven, his preparation doesn’t truly begin until after he has already done these things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once Steven is ready to get into bed, he goes downstairs. He turns out the lights, locks the door, and checks to make sure the stove hasn’t been left on. But he does more than just look at the stove; he also gently touches the dials to confirm they are in the “off” position. Then, he stares at the dials for 30 seconds to convince himself that touching them didn’t accidentally move them into the “on” position—even though this seems like it would be impossible with such a light touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, he goes upstairs to get into bed. But he is stopped by the thought that maybe he forgot to make sure the door was locked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;He thinks he remembers doing this, but the memory isn’t as clear as he would like it to be. Regardless, there’s always the chance he might not have turned the lock completely. So, he goes back to check the lock again. The short amount of time that has passed suggests maybe he should check the stove one more time, too. So he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once he gets into bed, he immediately begins to question if he turned off the lights. Or, maybe he brushed up against the dials of the stove on his way back upstairs, unintentionally turning it back on. The uncertainty is almost unbearable, and it would only take a short walk downstairs to relieve his anxiety. Thus, he goes through the whole process again. He’ll repeat these steps about 15-20 times before finally feeling like he’s able to stay in bed and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OCD symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Steven has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a surprisingly common condition that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30946823/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;affects up to 3% of the general population&lt;/a&gt;. People with OCD are plagued by persistent, intrusive thoughts called &lt;em&gt;obsessions&lt;/em&gt;. The obsessions are typically linked to &lt;em&gt;compulsions&lt;/em&gt;, which are acts a patient feels compelled to do in order to mitigate the distress caused by obsessive thoughts. For some, compulsions involve observable behaviors (like Steven’s stove-checking), but for others they might consist of mental acts like praying, reviewing past events, counting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;OCD obsessions often follow common themes like: fears of contamination (e.g., by germs), a preoccupation with symmetry, taboo thoughts (e.g., pedophilia, incest), and concerns about harming oneself or others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important to note that people with OCD are very unlikely to actually have taboo desires, or to intentionally hurt someone. Instead, they’re tortured by the fact that these types of thoughts can even appear in their consciousness. They go to great lengths, represented by their compulsions, to try to keep the thoughts from becoming reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;OCD symptoms occur on a spectrum, and the disorder can look quite different from case to case. One patient may seem to be outwardly healthy but suffer from obsessive thinking that disrupts her ability to concentrate, sleep, and maintain relationships. Another patient may be clearly debilitated by the disorder. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165310/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One teenage girl&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was afraid that pinworms might enter her mouth. To ward off the danger, she stopped speaking for 10 months and shunned eating until she needed to be hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OCD and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neuroscientists are still uncertain about what happens in the brain to cause OCD, but one popular hypothesis suggests it involves brain circuits that connect the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/frontal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;frontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; with a collection of structures called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to this perspective, OCD symptoms begin with activity in a part of the frontal cortex called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/orbitofrontal-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, or OFC. The OFC sits just above the eye sockets (aka the orbits), and has diverse functions—most of which are still poorly understood. Research, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9829024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggests that areas of the OFC are highly active when we notice something dangerous or threatening &lt;/a&gt;in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After we recognize that a threat is present, pathways that connect the OFC to the basal ganglia are activated. The basal ganglia are best known for their role in movement, but they are also involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions. They are especially important to: facilitation of goal-directed actions, development of habitual responses, and switching to a new behavior when it’s deemed necessary. The circuitry of the basal ganglia can be divided into two opposing pathways: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/direct-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;direct pathway&lt;/a&gt;, which facilitates action, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;indirect pathway&lt;/a&gt;, which inhibits it. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; if you want more details on how these basal ganglia circuits work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s look at how a simplified version of this OFC-basal ganglia circuit might work in a healthy individual. First, they notice something in the environment that could be identified as dangerous, and the OFC is involved in recognizing it as a potential threat. Let’s say they touch a door handle in a public restroom, which of course carries a risk of exposure to germs. The OFC interacts with the basal ganglia via the direct pathway to initiate an action to mitigate the threat. This leads to the person using a few squirts of hand sanitizer. At this point, the indirect pathway kicks in and inhibits further action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In someone with OCD, the pathway from the OFC to the basal ganglia tends to be overly excitable. OCD patients are hyper-aware of things in the environment that might pose a threat, and that level of awareness is linked to high levels of OFC activity. Thus, in the OCD patient, a threat might be detected not only when they touch the door handle in a public restroom, but also when they brush up against any surface that hasn’t recently been sanitized—even if it’s a countertop in their own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This extreme vigilance is associated with over-excitation of the direct pathway. When the direct pathway is activated, the individual is prompted to clean their hands. But the high level of activity in the direct pathway drowns out the inhibitory action of the indirect pathway, and the patient has a difficult time switching to a different behavior. Additionally, each time the threat is temporarily alleviated, the individual feels a transient sense of relief—which reinforces the response. All of this leads to compulsive behavior, and the hand-washing must be repeated a number of times before the patient is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not the whole story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This model of OCD is supported by a wealth of studies. Some have found increased activity among the circuits mentioned above in OCD patients, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24840803/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;others have found a reduction in that activity in response to the most common treatments&lt;/a&gt; for OCD (which include cognitive behavioral therapy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;More recent research&lt;/a&gt;, however, suggests that this model is too simplistic (a common refrain in neuroscience). For example, one problem is that the OFC is not a homogenous brain area, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;while some OFC regions are hyperactive in OCD, others appear to be hypoactive&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, research indicates that other parts of the brain (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/amygdala&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hippocampus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, and other regions) also play important roles in the manifestation of OCD symptoms, suggesting the model outlined above is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thus, although the OFC and basal ganglia seem to play important roles in OCD, the original model describing their interaction to produce OCD symptoms is likely only part of the story. Neuroscientists hope that further research will elucidate the neural circuitry behind OCD, and lead to better ways to help patients like Steven manage a disorder that can completely upend someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Menzies L, Chamberlain SR, Laird AR, Thelen SM, Sahakian BJ, Bullmore ET.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: “Psychological Flexibility” May Be Key To Good Relationships Between Couples And Within Families</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/21/psychological-flexibility-may-be-key-to-good-relationships-between-couples-and-within-families/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes for a happy family? The answer — whether you’re talking about a couple or a family with kids — is psychological “flexibility”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301952?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;according to a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science&lt;/em&gt;. Based on a meta-analysis of 174 separate studies, Jennifer S. Daks and Ronald Rogge at the University of Rochester conclude that flexibility helps — and inflexibility hinders — our most important relationships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41079&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair analysed data from 203 separate samples, comprising almost 44,000 participants in total. They homed in on measures of psychological flexibility and inflexibility within these studies (which often gathered other data, too), and how they related to measures of family and relationship functioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A psychologically flexible person is characterised by a set of attitudes and skills: they are generally open to and accepting of experiences, whether they are good or bad; they try to be mindfully aware of the present moment; they experience difficult thoughts without ruminating on them; they seek to maintain a broader perspective when faced with a challenge; they continue to pursue important goals despite setbacks; and they maintain contact with “deeper values”, no matter how stressful a day might be (so, for example, a parent confronted with a screaming child who holds the value of being a kind, compassionate parent is able to bear this in mind when choosing how to react to the child). Psychological inflexibility describes the opposite of these thoughts and attitudes, and also entails feeling judged or shameful for holding negative thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair identified a host of specific links between aspects of flexibility or inflexibility and family functioning. For example, they found that inattention to the present moment and a tendency to respond to challenging experiences in a rigid, inflexible way were linked to weaker family bonds. These factors were also linked to lower levels of satisfaction with romantic relationships, and less “adaptive” parenting, suggesting that such an inflexible parent “might have a more difficult time responding to their children’s misbehaviour in sensitive, compassionate and responsive ways.” (In contrast, greater flexibility was strongly linked to more adaptive parenting). A lack of awareness of the present moment was also associated with more shouting and violence among couples and, along with some other measures of inflexibility, to stronger feelings of insecurity in relation to the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note, however, that the overwhelming majority of links were correlational, so the direction of cause-and-effect is not clear. It could be the case that consistently poor child behaviour drives parental inflexibility, for example — or that the two exacerbate each other. The researchers themselves highlight this issue, calling for longitudinal studies to explore the direction and strength of the associations that they report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Daks and Rogge also point to potential practical implications of their findings. It might not seem especially surprising that psychological flexibility has emerged as being good for relationships. But in the past, research on flexibility has tended to focus on how it enhances an individual’s wellbeing, rather than the quality of romantic or familial relationships. In revealing the links between flexibility and family functioning, the work suggests a possible target for new interventions. A form of therapy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://contextualscience.org/act&quot;&gt;Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)&lt;/a&gt; encourages the development of flexibility, and there is plenty of evidence that it improves an individual’s own functioning, the pair notes. Perhaps, given the new results, it could help family functioning, too — especially if a parenting-focused ACT intervention were to be developed. Since links between greater psychological flexibility in parents and in their children have been reported, such an intervention might in theory have benefits that transmit down through generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301952&quot;&gt;Examining the correlates of psychological flexibility in romantic relationship and family dynamics: A meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: The forgotten Covid-19 ‘survivors’</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Photograph showing a shadowy woodland scene with autumn leaves covering the ground&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/Photo-long-covid-patient-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we celebrate the significant milestone of the first person in the UK to receive an effective vaccine against Covid-19, it is easy to forget the devastation this virus has caused for so many lives. Yet, tens of thousands of people in the UK are still battling symptoms, months after their initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Press articles and television documentaries have revealed the daily struggles of these ‘long Covid’ sufferers, but up to now, there has been little published research on the lived experience of this illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06001-y&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by a team of Oxford University academics, who worked in collaboration with 114 people from across the UK with long Covid, has systematically explored the story of this novel disease and the challenges its sufferers face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the symptoms and their effect on people’s daily lives, the research reveals significant questions about the availability and consistency of NHS care. It identifies important lessons that must be learned in order to reduce the long-term impact on individuals and their families, the healthcare system, and the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is long Covid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Covid is the name patients gave to COVID-19 symptoms that don’t resolve within the expected 4-week time frame. The number of people who develop it is contested, since many people who had Covid-19 were not formally tested, were not admitted to hospital (or even assessed in A&amp;amp;E) and their continuing suffering remains undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, long Covid can affect anyone, even working-age individuals who were previously fit and well. Symptoms are diverse and confusing. Breathlessness, overwhelming fatigue, and muscle pains are common. Many people suffer problems with attention or memory, chest pains, persistent cough, blood clots, gastric reflux, tingling sensations, rashes, and other ‘surprising’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some or all of these symptoms may be due to underlying organ damage, therefore patients should be properly assessed and receive appropriate tests where needed. However, many individuals have normal basic tests e.g. blood tests and X-rays and the underlying cause for their problems remains unknown. The causes and best treatments for many are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12223&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photograph showing a shadowy woodland scene with autumn leaves covering the ground&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12223 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/Photo-long-covid-patient-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘This is how I feel – a shadow of my former self’.&lt;/i&gt; Image attribution: Photo taken by a long Covid patient.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study team do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh&quot;&gt;Professor Trish Greenhalgh&lt;/a&gt;, the study team recruited 114 patients with long Covid using social media. They facilitated individual interviews and focus groups where participants shared their experiences of the illness’ invasion of their lives and their encounters with the NHS and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body. Many people were trapped in cycles of small improvements and crashing relapses and struggled to come to terms with the uncertainty and debilitation caused by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One participant captured the devastating impact on his personal life and occupational prospects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘I wasn’t able to go back to work and then I got made redundant. I can’t even imagine how I’m going to find a new job yet. In the last week […] it’s feeling possible finally, after nearly six months, that I might one day find a new job. But my life is just nothing like it was and it’s not really the life I want, you know; I need to improve.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care. They experienced confusion between the GP and 111 services, difficulty with remote or online consultations, a lack of continuity, and uninformed clinicians. Patients therefore often found themselves with no choice but to manipulate or seek out their own pathways for accessing care – often private or through personal contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety. Many had experienced encounters with ignorant or disbelieving clinicians, who dismissed their concerns. For example, a near heart-breaking account recounted how the participant was so breathless he called his GP whilst lying prone on his living room floor only to be told he didn’t sound very breathless and should take medication for anxiety. However, some participants did describe empathic, warm, caring clinicians who were supportive, and helpful, listening to their stories and sharing their distress – companions in their dreadful journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested quality principles for long Covid services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channeling the anger, frustration, fear, and hopelessness expressed by participants, the study team worked closely with a small group of sufferers to identify what would make for a high quality long Covid service: &lt;strong&gt;the ABCDEF of long Covid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12222&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12222 size-large&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/ABCDEF-long-covid-quality-principles-1024x569.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;ABCDEF Patient-generated quality principles for a long Covid service. Image Attribution: Prof. Trish Greenhalgh&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ccess to appropriate care that is not overly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;urdensome for patients and families, with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;linical responsibility held by one clinician. An individualized, multi-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;isciplinary approach should be followed using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;vidence-based standards with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;urther development of knowledge and services in collaboration with patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the authors described, ‘It’s been a humbling and emotional experience to work with such a committed group of patients with such powerful stories to tell. It’s sadly too late to change many of their experiences but hopefully, our suggestions could contribute to improvements for future long Covid patients.’&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>EU Commission gives €6 million to an obscure German start-up, promising to convert sewage to synthetic fuels. Internet sources suggest behind all this is &quot;Professor&quot; Ruggiero Santilli, the litigious &quot;Florida Genius&quot;, eternally self-appointed Nobel Prize candidate and sock-
puppeteering businessman. Exactly the kind of &quot;fringe scientist&quot; Smut Clyde likes to write about!</description>

	<title>arXiv.org blog: New guide offers author tips</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=842</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/12/18/new-guide-offers-author-tips/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors submitting their work to arXiv for the first time undoubtedly have questions. What file types are accepted? What licenses are available? How to format metadata properly? And what is metadata anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, arXiv’s new Author Guide offers researchers helpful tips and information throughout the submission process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors activate the guide by simply clicking a button from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/user/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user account page&lt;/a&gt; or on subsequent pages of the submission process. Once launched, the guide highlights and explains elements likely to be unfamiliar to new arXiv authors — and also provides links to more detailed information in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help section of arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_843&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SCreen shot of Author Guide button on user page&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-843 size-large&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/Author-Guide-Screen-Shot--1024x330.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;The Author Guide can be activated from the user account page or any page of the submission process.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Data collected regarding guide usage shows that authors who use the tool are more likely to successfully complete the submission process. In responses to a survey built into the guide, users described it as clear, helpful, user-friendly, detailed, and efficient. And, nearly three quarters of survey respondents indicated that they expected to use the Author Guide again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The submission process was much easier than before because of the Author Guide.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I think it is a positive add-on to the submission process.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“It’s very useful to speed up the submission process.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Anonymous survey respondents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors suggested ideas for improvements, and that feedback will be considered for future iterations of the guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv aims to help make authors’ lives easier, and the Author Guide is just one feature released recently to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of author guide welcome, after launching the guide&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-848&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/Author-Guide-P1-1024x631.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Neuroscience and Clinical Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-001.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-19-001&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Research Opportunities Using Invasive Neural Recording and Stimulating &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technologies in the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt; (Reissue of RFA-NS-18-010; U01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This FOA seeks applications to create diverse, integrated, multi-disciplinary teams composed of clinicians, scientists, engineers, and ethicists to pursue high-impact research questions/ hypotheses in human neuroscience. Proposed projects must employ innovative invasive devices to record and/ or stimulate neurons &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Awardees are expected to join a &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/investigative-human-neuroscience&quot;&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; which will set standards of practice (including neuroethical guidance), collect data for follow-up studies, and disseminate data to the broader neuroscience community. The application receipt date is&lt;strong&gt; October 29, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two FOAs below encourage translational and clinical studies for innovative invasive recording and/ or stimulating devices in humans (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, Early Feasibility Studies). These awards are part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/public-private-partnerships&quot;&gt;Public-Private Partnership Program&lt;/a&gt; (BRAIN PPP), which fosters collaborative clinical studies between investigators and manufacturers of novel Class III (invasive, risky) neural devices.

	<title>BRAIN Update: Funding Opportunity Announcements for Fiscal Year 2021: Neural Recording, Modulation, and Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainupdate.nih.gov/?p=2867</guid>
	<link>https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2020/12/17/funding-opportunity-announcements-for-fiscal-year-2021-neural-recording-modulation-and-stimulation/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week, a series of daily blog posts highlight 28 new and reissued BRAIN Initiative funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) for 2021. Today’s post summarizes four award opportunities focused on developing, improving, and advancing our understanding of neural recording, modulation, and stimulation methods in animals and humans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2867&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two FOAs aim to enhance our knowledge of the brain by funding research to develop and apply tools for neural recording, modulation, and stimulation. The awards build upon one another but fund separate projects. Proposed projects should involve invasive and/ or non-invasive &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; technologies useable in behaving animals (vertebrates and invertebrates), and eventually in humans. Applications should include plans to develop new large-scale recording methods, develop tools for circuit manipulation, and/ or link brain activity to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-020.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-18-020&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;New Technologies and Novel Approaches for Large-Scale Recording and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modulation in the Nervous System &lt;/strong&gt;(Reissue of RFA-NS-17-003; R01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This FOA supports proof-of-concept testing and development of new technologies and approaches for large-scale neural recording and modulation. This award encourages applicants to creatively address major challenges in this area of research. Proposed projects are expected to be high-risk and can incorporate diverse types of signaling beyond neuronal electrical activity, and may use modalities such as optical, magnetic, acoustic, and genetic recording/ manipulation. Applications are due on &lt;strong&gt;May 4, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-019.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-18-019&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Optimization of Transformative Technologies for Large Scale Recording and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modulation in the Nervous System &lt;/strong&gt;(Reissue of RFA-NS-17-004; U01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This FOA aims to optimize existing and emerging technologies related to recording and modulating neural activity. Funding is intended for the iterative refinement of tools that have already gone through proof-of-concept testing (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-020.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-18-020&lt;/a&gt;). Projects can utilize various modalities for neural signal recording and modulation. This award can support hardware/ software development and the broad dissemination of tools into regular neuroscience practice. Applications are due on &lt;strong&gt;May 4, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent advances in neurotechnologies, we know little about how they affect the brain at a basic cellular or circuit level. The next FOA funds research to study the biological effects of novel neural perturbation technologies, or invasive and non-invasive tools that stimulate, inhibit, or modulate neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-20-006.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-20-006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Biology and Biophysics of Neural Stimulation &lt;/strong&gt;(Reissue of RFA-NS-18-018; R01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This FOA seeks to systematically characterize, model, and validate the membrane, cellular, circuit, and adaptive biological responses of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to neural perturbation. Proposed projects to advance our understanding of the biological and bioinformatic content of these signals are also encouraged. Funding can support experiments designed to characterize responses in several model systems, including &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, animals, and humans. Proposals to develop new technologies, therapies, and disease models are not applicable to this FOA. Application due dates are &lt;strong&gt;February 2, June 1, &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;October 1, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Author Interview: Loes Janssen and Marie-Louise Kullberg on the Well-being of Parents and Adolescents in COVID-19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18539</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/PXi-wm_ICoI/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loes Janssen and Marie-Louise Kullberg used their ongoing Parent-Adolescent Interaction study as a baseline to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigate the well-being of Dutch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adolescents and parents&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, about one month after the participants were initially subject to local lockdown procedures. I spoke with the two researchers about the biggest surprise of their study, the need for diverse coping strategies, and one lesson that they hope the general public can take from their paper as lockdowns continue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suddenly had to work from home and pause the data collection of our PhD research project (‘RE-PAIR’). Within the RE-PAIR project, we already collected ecological momentary assessments (EMA) on mood and parenting behaviors in healthy adolescents and their parents during the past few years. Not being involved in any data collection due to the pandemic could mean having a lot of time to write papers… However, we both like to have some variation in the types of tasks we need to do. As for many researchers from all kind of disciplines—from immunologist to historians—the beginning of March also felt as an opportunity for us, psychologists, to investigate the impact of these exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within our research group, we decided to repeat the EMA to investigate the impact of the pandemic on mood and parenting in daily life, as we already had nice and complete baseline data of our families. By assessing mood and parenting at multiple moments per day, we were able to gain fine-grained insight into the impact of the pandemic on well-being in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were any of your findings particularly surprising or were the results of your study relatively in line with your expectations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, we were partly surprised by our findings. We expected that the COVID-19 pandemic would have had a more negative impact on well-being of parents, adolescents and parenting behavior, and we only found support for this regarding negative affect of parents. We also expected that a person’s intolerance of uncertainty would predict an increase in their negative affect and a decrease in their positive affect. This was not the case in our study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, we did expect and found individual differences among our participants: for some parents, negative affect increased, while for others it remained the same or even decreased. This makes sense, since spending more time together as a family could also have positive effects for some families. Moreover, our sample consisted of a fairly healthy group of parents and adolescents, living in favorable circumstances, which might make the situation more bearable as compared to families who struggle with mental or physical health problems or living in less fortunate environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the struggles that the parents and adolescents in your study face tend to differ (ex. the adolescents struggled with boredom whereas the parents did not), some of the coping mechanisms (watching tv-shows and online contact with friends and relatives) were effective for both groups. Why do you think that was the case with some but not all coping mechanisms?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We feel it is important to acknowledge that persons from different ages/stages in life (as parents versus adolescents in our study) cope differently with negative situations and emotions: Adolescents are in a phase that they start to spend more time with friends and being away from their family, whereas parents often like to keep the family close and, for instance, cook and dine together. Nonetheless, almost everyone brightens up from some social contact (even online) or behavioral activation (e.g. cooking, walking, painting etc.), as can be seen in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18575&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/Janssen_graph-1024x572.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The manuscript ends with advice for policy makers regarding the “one size does not fit all” effectiveness of coping strategies. Since this study occurred in April, have you noticed any improvements to the availability and diversity of coping strategies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the Dutch policy to control Corona outbreaks, regulate hospital admissions and protect vulnerable people, the government emphasizes to remain healthy, also by doing sports, for instance. Also, even though the numbers of corona-infected cases increased during a few weeks the past months (Fall 2020), schools remained open. As we know from recent research as well, this is important as children and adolescent friendships predict resilient functioning (van Harmelen et al., 2020). Going to school enables them to easily meet their friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, we feel policy makers could inform citizens more on practical coping strategies for families to foster mental well-being. We know for instance that staying active and exercising can boost your mood, but without a regular commute to work and regular sports activities, it is good to provide some alternative strategies which fit all different levels of lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several potential factors that could be further studied are mentioned in the article, but do you think applying your methodology to other populations of people or during a different 2-week stretch of the pandemic would provide useful data?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, we believe that applying the methodology of EMA to other populations could provide us with useful information on which groups of people are struggling in the current situation. For instance, gaining insights in how parents or adolescents with psychological problems, such as anxiety or depression, are affected by the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing of our study is also of importance. We have collected data during the first part of the lockdown in the Netherlands, without any prospect of relaxation of the regulations. If we would study mental well-being now, during the current—less strict but still prolonging—lockdown, we might get different results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the general public were to take one lesson from your study, what should that be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we will still spend a lot of time at home, conflicts and irritations among household members could make it hard to keep the atmosphere at home comfortable, a piece of practical advice to families is to cherish small positive interactions with each other on a regular basis. For instance, ask each other which person you admire and why, or go for a short walk together. Even those small activities or conversations could improve the overall family atmosphere. Above all, we need to keep in mind that all families are different, so within the possibilities, find what suits your family best to remain sane together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I thank both Loes and Marie-Louise providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you sit down to watch TV or a film these holidays, you might want to pay a little extra attention to how the soundtrack makes you feel. We all know that background music influences the tone of a scene but what, exactly, soundtracks do to our understanding of a character has not been studied in detail. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02242/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_1456740_69_Psycho_20201013_arts_A%5C&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Alessandro Ansani at Roma Tre University, Italy, and colleagues report work aimed at filling in some of the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41061&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 118 online participants who each watched a video clip that was just under two minutes long. It showed a man slowly walking towards tall windows in the columned corridor of an old building. The seaside was visible through the windows, in the distance. As the researchers describe it, he “walks, looks outside, stops, and moves out of the frame.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some of the participants heard the ambient sound that was recorded during the filming, while some heard an extract of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Variatio24&quot;&gt;The Isle of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;” by Sergei Rachmaninov (a “dogged and anxious” orchestral piece), and the rest heard “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoapxPvZy4&amp;amp;ab_channel=DrMabuse05&quot;&gt;Like Someone in Love&lt;/a&gt;” by Bill Evans (a “soft, melancholic” piano jazz solo). The participants then filled in questionnaires that asked about their perceptions of the man’s emotions, thoughts and personality, and how pleasant they thought the environment was .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with the other groups, those who’d heard the jazz reported feeling more empathy for the man, and perceived him to be more introverted. The Rachmaninov group felt him to be more conscientious, however. Participants who heard either music soundtrack perceived him to be more agreeable than those who only heard ambient sounds. Those who’d heard the jazz were also more likely to feel that the man was remembering a pleasant event in the past compared with the Rachmaninov listeners, who were more inclined to think that he was planning something. The jazz group also perceived his environment to be cosier. A second study with a batch of 92 students largely replicated these findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight “the multifaceted influence of the soundtrack on the interpretation of a scene,” the researchers write. We humans have an incessant need to search for knowledge everywhere, they add, and to fill in gaps using inference and imagination. “To understand the plot of a novel or movie, we need to know the characters’ goals and personalities, and if we have no information whatsoever, we try to take advantage of any cue to guess them.” Music, it seems, can act as a complex cue, allowing us to build up a picture of a person and a scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the original group watched the film out of the lab, the results may not extend to typical viewers of movies. While the participants did consistently report particular impressions of the man’s personality and thoughts when asked to do so, that doesn’t necessarily mean that people spontaneously form such impressions unprompted while watching a blockbuster on their sofa. However, though we would all probably expect movie soundtracks to have an impact on us, this research does help to address a previous criticism that actual research in this field has been sparse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02242/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_1456740_69_Psycho_20201013_arts_A%5C&quot;&gt;How Soundtracks Shape What We See: Analyzing the Influence of Music on Visual Scenes Through Self-Assessment, Eye Tracking, and Pupillometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BRAIN Update: Funding Opportunity Announcements for Fiscal Year 2021: Understanding Neural Circuits and Data Science</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainupdate.nih.gov/?p=2859</guid>
	<link>https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2020/12/16/funding-opportunity-announcements-for-fiscal-year-2021-understanding-neural-circuits-and-data-science/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week, a series of daily blog posts highlight 28 new and reissued BRAIN Initiative funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) for 2021. Today’s post features three FOAs for research teams working to develop integrative, novel methods to elucidate neural circuits and funding for data analysis, archiving, and standardization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2859&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Neural Circuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three awards aim to bring together interdisciplinary teams of investigators (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, neurobiologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and others) to advance our understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/understanding-circuits&quot;&gt;neural circuit basis&lt;/a&gt; of perception, emotion, cognition, and behavior by using cutting-edge technologies. All proposed projects should use innovative tools to examine the neural circuitry of cognitive processes, such as sensation, perception, emotion, decision-making, and/ or navigation. The use of multiple species, ranging from humans to other mammals and invertebrates, is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-20-029.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-20-029&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exploratory Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Programs – eTeamBCP&lt;/strong&gt; (Reissue of RFA-NS-18-029; U01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This FOA supports interdisciplinary research teams seeking to take an exploratory approach to elucidate how circuit activity underlies a behavioral or neural system. Applicants are encouraged to propose challenging goals that only a synergistic team can accomplish. Projects should be intended to develop experimental capabilities and theoretical frameworks in preparation for larger-scale efforts, including the multi-component Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Programs – TeamBCP (see below). Applications are due on &lt;strong&gt;June 15, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-002.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-19-002&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Programs – TeamBCP&lt;/strong&gt; (Clinical trial required; U19); &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-003.html&quot;&gt;RFA-NS-19-003&lt;/a&gt; (Clinical trial not allowed; U19) (Reissue of RFA-NS-17-018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This pair of FOAs support interdisciplinary research teams from prior BRAIN technology and/ or integrated approaches teams, and/ or new projects from the research community that focus on employing innovative technologies to study the neural circuitry of behavior. These FOAs solicit proposals that can greatly advance our understanding of circuit function within 5-plus years with a possibility of one renewal. Applications for both awards are due on &lt;strong&gt;October 29, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inquiries regarding the above FOAs, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:braincircuits@nih.gov&quot;&gt;braincircuits@nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobiology of Pain and Endogenous Opioids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAIN aims to understand how neural circuit activity translates to sensory, emotional, and cognitive functions, all of which are closely related to or controlled by pain circuits and/ or endogenous opioid systems. Pain conditions and the opioid crisis are important national public health concerns. As such, the BRAIN Initiative is now funding projects to elucidate the basic neurobiology and circuits of pain processing, analgesia, and the brain mechanisms implicated in opioid use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see notices &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-18-008.html&quot;&gt;NOT-NS-18-008&lt;/a&gt; (pain) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-18-046.html&quot;&gt;NOT-DA-10-046&lt;/a&gt; (opioids) for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science and Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BRAIN Initiative and neuroscience as a whole are generating massive amounts of data that span modalities, spatiotemporal scales, and species. Largely driven by recent innovations in high-throughput -omics profiling, optical microscopy, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging, brain data is rapidly growing. The FOAs below support new approaches to analyze, archive, and standardize the collection of these data. For all awards collaborations with scientists from other disciplines are encouraged. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Take Better Care Of Public Parks If They Feel A Greater Sense Of Ownership Over Them</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41056</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/16/people-take-better-care-of-public-parks-if-they-feel-a-greater-sense-of-ownership-over-them/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “tragedy of the commons” was popularised in the 1960s as a way of explaining how public or shared resources which we’re incentivised to use can become depleted or ruined by individual self-interest. And because we have &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; ownership of public resources we feel we have less responsibility for them and therefore less of an impetus to contribute time, energy or money to keeping them going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we become more aware (and more concerned) about threats to the environment, the tragedy of the commons seems even more pertinent. How do we keep parks, rivers, lakes and other local resources well-maintained? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242920952084&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Marketing, &lt;/em&gt;it might come down to a sense of ownership — the more we feel a property or resource is ours, the better we’ll take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41056&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The focus of the first study was a lake, where 135 participants had rented kayaks. The rental service largely catered to those with no experience of the lake, meaning they were unlikely to have any sense of ownership of the area before their visit. Some of the kayak renters were asked to think of and write down a nickname for the lake, while others were not; all renters were then told that they should pick up objects or trash they found floating in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two experimenters then watched the participants and recorded any attempts to pick up floating objects (which had been planted in the lake by the team). When the participants returned their kayaks, they indicated whether or not they had picked up any rubbish and how much ownership they felt toward the lake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who had given the lake a nickname reported significantly higher levels of psychological ownership of the lake than those who had not. They were also more likely to actually take care of the lake: 41% attempted to pick up the floating objects, compared to just 7% of those in the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, participants imagined walking in a park, seeing a sign that said either “welcome to the park” or “welcome to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; park” (emphasis added). Participants were then asked how much responsibility they felt for the park, how obligated they felt towards the park, how accountable they felt for it, and whether or not they would pick up rubbish in the park. Participants were also asked how much of $100 they would donate to the park.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, boosting feelings of ownership by highlighting that it was “your” park increased participants’ perceived responsibility for the park. This led these participants to say they would be more likely to pick up rubbish, and to increase their intended donation amount by an average of $8. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third study, back in the real world, looked at cross country skiers. When renting skis, participants were offered a map of the park: some were asked to plan their route on the map before they set out, while others were not. All renters were then asked whether or not they wanted to add a dollar to the rental fee to help the park, before indicating how likely they would be to volunteer for the park, donate in the future, or engage with the park on social media. Participants who planned their route again reported greater responsibility for the park, and were also more likely to say they’d donate to the park and volunteer in future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study, lab-based study found that a commonly used device — an attendance sign which highlighted that a participant was the 22,452th visitor of the week — reduced the beneficial effects of boosting feelings of psychological ownership. This suggests that when people see themselves as just one individual in a larger group, they felt less responsibility towards the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the results do suggest clear interventions that could benefit publicly owned goods, the whole point of such resources is that they’re &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; — the fact they’re collectively owned is exactly why we’re able to enjoy their many benefits. So should we be encouraging people to think of them as their &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; property? Collectivism puts an emphasis on group collaboration and shared interests — factors that could play a part in preserving local resources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research could look into interventions that seek to increase feelings of local collectivity, exploring how that, rather than individualism, might change people’s relationship with their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242920952084&quot;&gt;Caring for the Commons: Using Psychological Ownership to Enhance Stewardship Behavior for Public Goods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Speech Emotion recognition using deep neural networks using Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2020-12-16:/2020/12/16/speech-emotion-recognition-using-deep-neural-networks-using-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients.html</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shreyah Iyer will talk about her project &quot;Speech Emotion recognition using deep neural networks using Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech is a very important context in understanding human emotions for example
in psychology and criminology as the effects of emotions in voice can be
recognized by all people irrespective of the language of speech. In this
presentation I will talk about an ongoing KTP Project on Speech Emotion
Recognition system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to build a system which can interpret the underlying
emotion from an audio/speech signal. So far, I have worked on using Deep
Learning architectures, i.e CNN’s with most widely used features for emotion
detection such as MFCC’s and Mel-spectrograms. I have especially investigated
what the best way is to use the coefficients extracted from MFCC’s. I have
worked on are two publicly available Speech Emotion Corpus i.e., TESS and
RAVDESS. Results conducted on these experiments show that the MFCC’s features
with an optimal stack length supersedes the other CNN architectures used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will also talk about the challenges and future work for
this project.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How Many Different Positive Emotions Do We Experience?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41050</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awe, compassion, love, gratitude… research papers and media stories about these emotions abound. Indeed, the past decade has seen an explosion in work on positive emotions — essentially, emotions that involve pleasant rather than unpleasant feelings. However, very little has been done to explore which distinct feelings, thoughts and motivations characterise each one, argue Aaron Weidman and Jessica Tracy at the University of British Columbia. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-54608-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Emotion, &lt;/em&gt;they report their detailed investigation into these subjective experiences — an investigation that has led them to drop some commonly accepted positive emotions from their master list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41050&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weidman and Tracy began with 18 positive emotions, all of which had been studied in recent papers. These were: admiration, amusement, attachment love, awe, compassion, contentment, empathy, enthusiasm, gratitude, happiness, hope, interest, love, nurturant love, romantic love, schadenfreude, sympathy and tenderness. (Pride has been studied down to the level of its subjective elements in work previously led by Tracy, so wasn’t included in the new research.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair sorted these emotions into five thematic groups: “other-appreciation” (e.g. gratitude), caring (e.g. empathy, compassion), enjoyment (e.g. happiness, contentment) and loving. A total of 150 undergraduate students were each presented with one of the five groups and asked to report up to 10 subjective “elements” of each emotion in that group. For example, participants wrote “I felt concern for someone” as a subjective element of sympathy, and listed “I was on top the world” as an element of enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By identifying elements that seemed to best capture unique aspects of each emotion, the pair whittled more than 1,000 frequently experienced subjective elements to a list of 475, covering the five thematic groups. A fresh batch of participants were then asked to reflect on how they had felt during a given emotion, and to identify elements that best matched those feelings from the relevant group list. Using their responses, Weidman and Tracy homed in on yet smaller lists of elements that best matched each individual emotion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it was not possible to create a distinct set of elements for every emotion. In one striking example, no unique element stood out to separate “compassion” from “empathy” and “tenderness” — and so compassion was dropped from their list of positive emotions. Neither could the pair clearly differentiate between the subjective elements of “happiness” and “contentment”, which went into the next round as “happiness/contentment”. “Love” also failed to make the cut, because it was not distinguishable from its sub-types, which had their own unique elements — in fact, Weidman and Tracy found clear support for a sub-type of “attachment love” (involving a close, secure bond with someone), as well as “nurturant love” (more to do with being dedicated to helping someone else to grow) and “romantic love”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To shrink the element lists to a number practical for use in a scale — and also in a bid to check for agreement between people from different backgrounds — the pair then recruited a fresh batch of more than 1,000 participants. This group comprised men and women who identified as White or East Asian, and who were born either in the US or Canada or in another country. As in the second study, they were asked to rate how relevant various elements were to each emotion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the six participant groups tended to agree about their subjective experiences of the now 15 emotions. They then used a statistical technique to prune their responses into the final product: 5- to 8-item self-report scales for each of these positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair argue that their work has various implications. Firstly, though they did find some overlap between elements associated with the different emotions (which will need investigating further), the work supports the relatively modern idea that we experience a range of discrete positive emotions. Also, the research supports the argument that love is not a unitary construct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of their other conclusions will be more controversial, however. For example “happiness” and “contentment” are often conceptualised as distinct emotions, but this is not what they concluded. Neither did they find support for the idea that “joy” and “elation” are independent, discrete emotions — items that reflected both these concepts fell readily under the “happiness/contentment” heading. The loss of “compassion” from the list of positive emotions will be contentious, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new scales clearly need more testing — and it’s important to note that all the participants, no matter where they were born, were living in the US or Canada, which limits generalisability. However, one of the problems with existing work on positive emotions is that different teams often use different measures, making it hard to compare results. If these scales can be accepted, they will help to make work in the field more standardised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair certainly acknowledge that there’s much still to be done, however: “We hope that this work marks a first step in the development of a taxonomy of subjectively experienced positive emotions,” they write — “a model of exactly how many positive emotions are experienced as subjectively distinct, as well as the distinguishing set of subjective elements, causal antecedents, and functional consequences that characterize each of these states.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-54608-001&quot;&gt;Picking up good vibrations: Uncovering the content of distinct positive emotion subjective experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-mh-19-135.html&quot;&gt;RFA-MH-19-135&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Development of Novel Tools to Probe Cell-Specific and Circuit-Specific &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processes in Human and Non-Human Primate Brain &lt;/strong&gt;(Clinical trial optional; UG3/UH3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This new FOA solicits the development and validation of novel, cutting-edge tools to study and manipulate cell types and circuits in large mammal brains. Funding can support initial proof-of-principle studies aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of approaches in humans and other mammals (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, non-human primates, sheep, pigs). Research areas applicable to this award range from validating and refining viral gene delivery systems to tracing cell lineage. Please see the FOA for more examples. Applications are due on &lt;strong&gt;May 27, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-21-006.html&quot;&gt;RFA-DA-21-006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tools for Germline Gene Editing in Marmosets &lt;/strong&gt;(Clinical trial not allowed; U01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;The purpose of this new FOA is to develop tools and technologies to conduct scientifically rigorous, ethical, efficient, and cost-effective research,  as well as develop infrastructure, that supports germline gene editing studies in the common marmoset (&lt;em&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/em&gt;). Marmosets possess sophisticated cognitive functions and exhibit cooperative social behavior, and now that they can be made amenable to genetic engineering, are well-suited for rigorous research involving the genetic study of behavior and/ or brain disorders. Applications should propose to optimize breeding technologies, develop germline and somatic gene editing tools (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, CRE-driver tools, CRISPR), and/ or promote infrastructure to develop and distribute these resources. Please see the FOA for a full list of relevant research topics. The application receipt date is &lt;strong&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-20-556.html&quot;&gt;RFA-MH-20-556&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pilot Resources for Brain Cell Type-Specific Access and Manipulation Across Vertebrate Species&lt;/strong&gt; (Clinical trial not allowed; U01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-20-556.html&quot;&gt;new FOA&lt;/a&gt; is the first in a series of BRAIN 2.0 transformative projects, which were inspired by recommendations in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0&lt;/a&gt; reports. These large-scale projects will build upon the early successes of BRAIN by developing and disseminating resources to the research community. This FOA is aimed to evaluate molecular or genetic technologies, as well as create pilot production and distribution resources for cell type-specific access and manipulation reagents across vertebrate species. Proposed projects should be scalable, and reagents must enable unique access to many molecularly defined cell types in a complex brain region; be easily produced, disseminated, utilized, and stored; and be catalogued for users in a reference brain cell atlas. Please see the FOA for additional details. Applications are due on &lt;strong&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;October 19, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many FOAs in the BRAIN Initiative are now subject to a data sharing requirement (see notice &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-010.html&quot;&gt;NOT-MH-19-010&lt;/a&gt;). Please view related notices in each FOA to see if an award falls under this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please visit the BRAIN Initiative’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/funding-opportunities&quot;&gt;Funding Opportunities&lt;/a&gt; webpage for more details on these and other awards.

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Here’s How Parents’ Reactions To School Performance Influence Their Children’s Wellbeing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41039</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/14/heres-how-parents-reactions-to-school-performance-influence-their-childrens-wellbeing/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What do you do if your child comes home with a lower score on a test than you both expected? Do you praise their efforts and focus on what they got right? Or do you home in on the answers that they got wrong, hoping this will help them to do better in future?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the first, “success-oriented” response is more common in the US than in China, where parents more often opt for “failure-oriented” responses instead. &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-59134-001&quot;&gt;Recent studies in both countries &lt;/a&gt;have found that success-oriented responses tend to encourage psychological wellbeing but not necessarily academic success, whereas failure-oriented responses can foster academic performance, but with a cost to the child’s wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jun Wei at Tsinghua University, China, and colleagues wondered what might drive these observed relationships: do different response styles lead children to form different concepts about what their parents want for them — and is this what produces the opposing impacts on wellbeing? In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-79116-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, the team report some intriguing answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41039&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied 447 American children from three schools in the US and 439 children from a school in southern China. The children were in the same grade of school and were, on average, 13 at the start of the study. They completed a batch of initial surveys, and then a further batch a year later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one of the initial surveys, the children were asked to imagine that they had done very well and then very poorly on a school test, and indicate the extent to which they thought their parents would emphasise the successful aspects of their performance, or the negatives (e.g.  “My parents would talk about why I didn’t get an even higher score” if they had done well, or “My parents would talk about how I had not worked hard” if they had done poorly).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with surveys of general wellbeing and symptoms of anxiety and depression, the children also answered questions about their perceptions of their parents’ goals for them. Responses to statements such as “How important is it to your parents for you to believe in your abilities?” were used to probe parental goals relating to self-worth, while statements such as “How important is to your parents for you to always try to overcome your weaknesses?” explored the extent to which the children thought that their parents held “self-improvement” goals for them.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that, in both countries, children who felt that their parents were more success-oriented in their responses were more likely to feel that their parents held self-worth goals for them, and statistically speaking, this went a long way to explaining higher levels of general wellbeing in this group a year later. In the US only, stronger perceptions that parents held self-worth goals were also associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression a year on. Why wasn’t this seen in the children in China, too? It might be because children in China are subject to more academic stress, because of the format of the school examination system, the team suggests — and the impact of this on symptoms of anxiety and depression overwhelms any variations relating to parental response style.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both the US and China, the team also found that the more parents used failure-oriented responses, the more the children felt that their parents held self-improvement goals for them — and in China only, the more they felt their parents were concerned about their self-worth too. This may be “because Chinese parents convey their belief in their children’s potential by urging them to strive to do better”, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, failure-oriented responses from the parents were also associated with decreased wellbeing among the American children, and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in kids from both countries.  “It could be that when parents highlight the negative aspects of their children’s performance, adolescents feel incompetent, regardless of whether they perceive their parents as wanting them to constantly strive to self-improve,” the researchers write. “The thwarted need for competence may dampen adolescents’ psychological functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team did home in only a few dimensions of the parent-child relationship, which is, of course, complex. For parents everywhere, it would certainly be interesting to know whether the positive academic effects of a failure-oriented response style could be gained without a cost to wellbeing — could an emphasis on praising successes with a dash of observation of any failures of effort work best, perhaps? I know that as parent, that’s what I aim for. But only future research will reveal if it’s actually a good strategy for my children.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week, a series of daily blog posts will highlight 28 new and reissued BRAIN Initiative funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) for 2021. Today’s post focuses on awards for training, equity, and inclusion; technology dissemination; and small business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2837&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to FOA week! In recent years, BRAIN-funded scientists have developed new tools and technologies that now allow us to uncover the complexities of the brain in incredible detail. Next year’s funding will continue to accelerate neuroscience discovery by building upon the early successes of the Initiative. In this blog series, we’re excited to highlight several &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0&lt;/a&gt; transformative project FOAs, which will support the development and dissemination of resources and data to the research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we will guide you through each of the 28 BRAIN Initiative FOAs for 2021. These awards support training, small business programs, and span across all seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/brain-priority-areas&quot;&gt;BRAIN priority areas&lt;/a&gt;: from developing and validating innovative tools for studying cells and circuits, to mapping the brain across species and advancing human neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training, Equity, and Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/DNA-Seq_29464384_C-Mopic-fotolia.de-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When BMC published its first journals back in 2000, it made high quality research open to anyone who wanted to access and use it. By making open access sustainable, it changed the world of academic publishing. Amongst the first disciplines to successfully embrace open access was genetics and genomics, with BMC launching a number of journals in this important field in its first year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today, BMC continues to recognize the importance of genetics and genomics with a number of our community-specific journals celebrating their 20th anniversaries, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. As we reflect on our long-standing reputation as an open access pioneer, we remain passionate about promoting open science practices and responding to researcher’s needs in this vital field. One aspect that we view as central to this mission is the sharing of research data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We know that research data often lie hidden until shared via a repository and/or through a research article that uses the data to support conclusions and analyses. We understand that not all valuable research is suited to traditional research articles and are committed to making visible research that would otherwise be hidden away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As part of this commitment, we are delighted to announce that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will be renamed in 2021 as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genomic Data, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;with the goal of promoting open science through the sharing of genomic and genetic data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genomic Data, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;built on the firm foundations of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, will welcome submissions of genetic and genomic datasets, descriptions of data and manuscripts that analyse existing or new datasets. By providing a dedicated home for content &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;that may not meet the criteria for a traditional research article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we hope to better serve the evolving needs of the genetics and genomics community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a core offering of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genomic Data,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; we are particularly excited to introduce our new ‘data note’ article type, designed specifically for descriptions of genetic and genomic datasets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data notes in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; were pioneered by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/data-notes?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, following that journal’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/14/bmc-research-notes-goes-back-roots/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;relaunch in 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By encouraging the sharing, describing and citing of data, we hope to make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genomic Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; a home for genomic and genetic datasets, data-focused research, and key developments in open data in general – going forward we will welcome opinions on how this journal can lead the way in open and reproducible science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BMC Genomic Data &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;is supported by an international editorial board, bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and expertise in genomic data and all published articles published will undergo rigorous peer review. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We look forward to working with you in advancing data sharing in this important field and offering you a home for all your research, whatever format that may take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychology is arguably the poster child for the replication crisis, but other fields suffer from similar issues too&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/psychology-s-replication-crisis-inspires-ecologists-push-more-reliable-research&quot;&gt;Cathleen O’Grady examines the efforts by ecologists to tackle their own field’s reproducibility problems&lt;/a&gt;, and how they are learning from the experience of psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41023&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have created a safer version of the psychoactive drug ibogaine, and it seems to improve behaviours associated with addiction and depression in rats.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work had suggested that ibogaine may help treat drug addictions — but it can also have fatal side-effects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/09/944572325/progress-toward-a-safer-psychedelic-drug-to-treat-depression-and-addiction&quot;&gt;reports Jon Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. So in the new work, scientists tweaked the structure of the molecule to create a substance that is safer but which still has beneficial properties. It remains to be seen whether it works for humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shortest day of the year is nearly upon us &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; but if you’ve found yourself taken aback by the dark evenings, you’re not alone. &lt;/strong&gt;Even though we experience dark winter nights every year, there are psychological reasons why we might “forget” about them and find it unsettling when they come around again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxvm8/why-we-forget-how-early-it-gets-dark-every-year&quot;&gt;explains Shayla Love&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The uncertainty of 2020 has been difficult for a lot of us. &lt;/strong&gt;But some people find it particularly challenging to deal with feelings of uncertainty, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/learning-to-cope-with-uncertainty-during-covid-19-151420&quot;&gt;writes Jayne Morriss&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Greater “intolerance” of uncertainty can leave people feeling distressed and make even good outcomes appear less satisfactory &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but, Morriss explains, there are a number of strategies which may help to reduce this “uncertainty distress”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have &lt;strong&gt;implanted an array of electrodes into the visual cortex of two macaques, which allow the monkeys to “see” shapes corresponding to the pattern of stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The work holds promise for restoring some amount of sight to people who are blind and whose optic nerve is damaged. But it is harder to access the relevant brain regions in humans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2261853-brain-stimulation-device-lets-monkeys-see-shapes-without-using-eyes/&quot;&gt;explains Michael Le Page&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and fairly crude artificial vision is not necessarily desired by the blind community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with “dark” personality traits are manipulative and self-centred &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but does that actually help them get ahead? &lt;/strong&gt;In some lab-based tasks, perhaps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed&quot;&gt;write Craig Neumann and Scott Barry Kaufman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, but when it comes to real life they actually have limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This weekend, the Cosmic Shambles Network is hosting a 24 hour online show, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicshambles.com/ninelessons&quot;&gt;Nine Lessons and Carols for Socially Distanced People&lt;/a&gt;“, with profits going to charity. &lt;/strong&gt;The line-up looks fantastic, with comedians, authors, actors, musicians, and scientists all taking part — including a bunch of psychologists and neuroscientists (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/podcast/&quot;&gt;PsychCrunch podcast&lt;/a&gt; presenter Ginny Smith!).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future: Essay Challenge</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18559</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ggtXoRqpVeM/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthra.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Health Research Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (HRA) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Public Library of Science&lt;/a&gt; (PLOS) have partnered to launch the &lt;strong&gt;Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future &lt;/strong&gt;Essay Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biomedical research enterprise experienced a year of reckoning in 2020. Global cooperation to create a COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented pace shows the promise of research. Yet the pandemic, the resulting economic and social uncertainties, and the urgency of addressing systemic racial and regional inequities all add to longstanding concerns about the sustainability of the biomedical research enterprise. We need a new vision for a healthier future. The &lt;strong&gt;Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future &lt;/strong&gt;Essay Challenge is your opportunity to propose systemic changes that re-commit to serving society and achieving an equitable, diverse, and creative environment for &lt;strong&gt;all &lt;/strong&gt;those working to advance scientific discovery and improve human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We invite you to submit a 1500-word essay following these &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg4rQ26IOuBmY_cC8C1CRmQFlISIr3UU/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submission guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The winning essay will be published in either &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;and will also receive a US $5,000 prize. There will also be recognition for up to four essays receiving honorable mentions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to think critically about the current state of biomedical research, globally. We hope our challenge stimulates you to confer with colleagues and consider submitting an individual or multi-authored essay that will propose and elaborate new ideas addressing the challenges for the field – for example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovative ways to move away from contemporary and reductive metrics of success and towards efforts that measurably improve everyday lives (e.g. advances in diagnostics, therapy, drug discovery, health services, and novel solutions to reduce health inequities).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bold ideas to realign incentives for behaviors that advance discovery, support healthcare decision makers, and benefit society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New ways to frame transparency and rigor as Open Scholarship values, not just checklists or hurdles, to improve societal trust in science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategies to build an equitable, open, and transparent research ecosystem that values, empowers, and nurtures diversity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approaches that depend on creativity and innovation and not on the need for “more” (e.g.  more money, more data, more publications, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner, and Honorable Mentions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The winning essay judged to have the most potential for inspiring change will be published either in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, whichever is deemed by PLOS the most appropriate venue for the essay. It will also be awarded US $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up to four essays will be recognized by an honorable mention, and these will be published on the PLOS Blogs Network and will each receive a US $2,500 prize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symposium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the winning essay, and authors from honorably mentioned essays, will be invited to present their ideas in a &lt;strong&gt;Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future &lt;/strong&gt;Symposium hosted by HRA and PLOS in September 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline: March 11, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This date is the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic. It has been chosen to honor those who have experienced so much suffering during this pandemic, and to help convey the real-world importance of this reimagining.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eligibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We welcome essay submissions from individuals or from teams, noting that diverse perspectives are critical to solving our most pressing global challenges. Submissions will be considered from those working in academic, private sector, governmental, or non-profit institutions. Authors must commit to abiding by PLOS policies for publication which include Open Access publication under CC BY license, and editorial policies such as disclosure of competing interests. (See full &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg4rQ26IOuBmY_cC8C1CRmQFlISIr3UU/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submission guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Criteria and Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a 1500-word limit to keep essays succinct and to the point. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should include a brief description of the problem you propose to solve, and devote the majority of the essay to the proposed solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A panel representing HRA member organizations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthra.org/members/member-profiles/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HRA members&lt;/a&gt;) will score applications based on the review criteria outlined below, to create a shortlist of up to ten essays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnitude of the change envisioned &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential for achieving lasting impact and change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Novelty and timeliness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feasibility &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversity of thought and perspective &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No single criterion outweighs another; all are important. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overall winner, and honorable mentions, will then be selected from this shortlist by the panel of judges, including: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maryrose Franko&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director, Health Research Alliance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonia Pariente&lt;/strong&gt;, Editor-in-Chief, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lara Bethke&lt;/strong&gt;, Chief Scientific Officer, Health Resources in Action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sindy Escobar Alvarez&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior Program Officer, Medical Research Program, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan M. Fitzpatrick&lt;/strong&gt;, President, James S. McDonnell Foundation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynne Garner,&lt;/strong&gt; President, The Donaghue Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marc Hurlbert&lt;/strong&gt;, Chief Science Officer, Melanoma Research Alliance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judy Keen&lt;/strong&gt;, Director of Scientific Affairs, American Society of Hematology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy Laster&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice President, Science and Awards Programs, Foundation Fighting Blindness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawid Potgieter&lt;/strong&gt;, Director, Programs in Discovery Science, Templeton World Charity Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The panel reserves the right to reach out to other reviewers, in confidence, for input into the decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before publication, the &lt;strong&gt;winning essay&lt;/strong&gt; may be edited by a PLOS editor for length and style to conform to the PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg4rQ26IOuBmY_cC8C1CRmQFlISIr3UU/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; journal format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s been invested in an election result will understand the close relationship between politics and emotion — something that is perhaps even more affecting when that result is disappointing. After the 2016 presidential election, for example, articles appeared in the US press describing a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/09/trump-induced-anxiety-is-a-real-thing.html&quot;&gt;national nervous breakdown&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/opinion/depressed-by-politics-just-let-go.html&quot;&gt;offering tips&lt;/a&gt; to deal with so-called “political depression”, and empirical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178117320322?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the same event had caused psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while it would be hard to deny that politics can have a serious impact on our mood, is it correct to call that “depression”? Almog Simchon at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and team ask this question in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-27301-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology &lt;/em&gt;— and while they find &lt;em&gt;self-reported&lt;/em&gt; “Trump depression” in liberal Americans post-election, the empirical data suggests this isn’t an enduring or even clinically significant experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41011&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the study, participants indicated which political party they felt the greatest identification with, as well as which presidential candidate they had voted for in 2016; they then indicated how down, depressed and hopeless they had felt for the year before the election, the two weeks before the election, and from the election until the day of the survey, which took place in May 2018. As expected, those who identified as Democrats reported feeling more depressed after the election, with the opposite effect to be found in Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then repeated the experiment with new participants — only now all references to the election were omitted, with questions instead focusing purely on the timeframes involved. This time, there was no evidence of a post-election increase in depression among Democrats. This suggests that the emotional valence of certain events can change the stories we tell about ourselves and our lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next study looked more broadly at liberal American responses to the election using real time data about people’s moods at the time of the election. To do this, the team used a machine learning algorithm originally designed to detect depression from social media users’ posts. The team analysed over 10 million tweets posted between October and November 2016, and while there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an effect on Democrats’ moods in the first few days after the election, this response was not long-lived: by November 13th, moods had returned to their pre-election baseline. A similar analysis of Google searches, looking for terms such as “depression”, “depression symptoms”, and “depression test” also found no indication that the election had caused a significant increase in depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social media &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/&quot;&gt;may not be the best gauge&lt;/a&gt; for understanding the long-term impact of an event on mental health — Twitter in particular is fast-moving and responsive to ongoing events, and not necessarily so good at capturing deeper or more persistent effects. But the findings do suggest, again, that emotional responses to the election were more ephemeral than the term “depression” might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two final studies looked at real world attempts to seek help for depression. The first looked at state-level antidepressant consumption on Medicaid between 2016 and 2017, and the second at the number of people seeking treatment for depression before and after the election, using a data set that also contained daily information about depression and political affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the state-level data, the team found that the state’s political affiliation — Democratic or Republican — had no bearing on changes in antidepressant usage from before to after the election. And in the second study, there was no evidence that the depression levels of liberal Americans increased after the election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it seems that reports of “Trump depression” are not quite accurate: in every study other than the first — in which participants were specifically reminded of the election — there was no evidence at all that depression had increased after the election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that self-reports of post-election depression could be somewhat performative, signalling group identity and ideological beliefs. This might not tell the whole story, though — there’s no evidence here that the feelings of distress or hopelessness felt by liberals after the election were false or purely performative, just that they weren’t clinically significant or persistent enough to be considered depression per se.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to look further into the traits and demographics of those reporting feelings of distress. If you’re a wealthy person with liberal politics, for example, then an election win for a pro-austerity party might be distressing but is unlikely to have as significant an impact on the material conditions of your life as that of someone on a low wage or in precarious work. Would the latter party be more likely to experience depression? And what protective factors are at play when it comes to weathering political distress?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team partly puts the use of the term “Trump depression” down to “concept creep”, an expanding or overgeneralisation of the terminology of mental illness or trauma. It therefore seems important to develop a way to talk about distress — political or otherwise — outside of such terms, which can often be stigmatising or lacking in nuance. Using clinical terms unnecessarily might seem validating, but only serves to diminish both the experiences of those living with serious mental illness and the range of normal emotions that we experience across our political, social and personal lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-27301-001&quot;&gt;Political depression? A big-data, multimethod investigation of Americans’ emotional response to the Trump presidency.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Instant access to code, for any arXiv paper</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=828</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/12/10/instant-access-to-code-for-any-arxiv-paper/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;a new feature empowering arXiv authors to link their Machine Learning articles to associated code&lt;/a&gt;. Developed in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt;Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;, the tool was met with great enthusiasm from arXiv’s ML community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re expanding the capability beyond Machine Learning to arXiv papers in every category. And, to better align with our arXiv communities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/paperswithcode/papers-with-code-is-expanding-to-more-sciences-5d375d10ca3a&quot;&gt;PwC is launching new sites&lt;/a&gt; in computer science, physics, mathematics, astronomy and statistics to help researchers explore code in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-710 size-full aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;924&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this expansion, PwC is indexing 600,000 additional papers, automatically detecting and linking to the code libraries for papers in categories beyond Machine Learning and also continuing to identify code, results, and methods within ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of Papers with Code portal sites&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-830 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/PwC-Portals-222x300.png&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Authors can sync their code to display on arXiv abstract pages from either their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/user/&quot;&gt;arXiv user account page&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.paperswithcode.com&quot;&gt;Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt; interface, if the code is not automatically detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expansion was driven by the broader research community’s demand. After the October release, researchers beyond ML expressed a desire for easy access to relevant code. Researchers in physics, astronomy, and other fields began adding their work to PwC. To answer the popular demand, we worked together with PwC to formally support additional fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv authors and readers value speed and openness, and instant access to publicly available code supports both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>If the paywall sites are going to attract more consumers, and provide them safe harbor from the free-news vortex, then Radcliffe says they’ll need to make a better case for why it’s worth the money. That means letting people know the actual cost of producing journalism, and what’s at risk if you don’t financially support it. Otherwise, big publications will only serve a minority of the population, small publications will struggle to survive, and people who have grown accustomed to free news will continue to seek it out, even if it ends up not really being news at all.</description>

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Hodgkin-Huxley model in current clamp and voltage clamp</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/?p=6665</guid>
	<link>https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/12/09/hodgkin-huxley-model-in-current-clamp-and-voltage-clamp/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a short modeling session for an electrophysiology course at the University of Zurich, I made a  tutorial for students to play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in a Colab Notebook / Python, which does not require them to install Python. You’ll find the code online on a small Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the code, the students can not only play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, but also replicate in silico the experiments they have done when patching cells in slices (including voltage clamp experiment).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is really rewarding to be able to reproduce current clamp (recording the membrane potential) and voltage clamp experiments (recording the currents while clamping the voltage to a constant value), because this also allows to replicate computationally the experiments and plots generated experimentally by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/&quot;&gt;Hodgkin and Huxley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below, you see a part of the code, the result of a simulation of a Hodgkin-Huxley model. The top configuration was run in current clamp, with a current pulse injected between 40 and 80 ms, which triggered a single action potential. The lower configuration was run in voltage clamp, with the holding potential stepping from -70 mV to -30 mV between 40 and 80 ms. You can clearly see the active conductanves (deactivating sodium conductance in blue and non-deactivating potassium conductance in orange):&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Why Are We Better At Remembering Vocal Melodies Than Instrumental Tunes?</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/09/why-are-we-better-at-remembering-vocal-melodies-than-instrumental-tunes/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to memory for music, humans show an interesting quirk: we’re better at remembering melodies that are sung by voice, compared to those played on an instrument. Even a melody sung without any lyrics — just a series of &lt;em&gt;la la las&lt;/em&gt;, for instance — becomes lodged in our memory in a way that a tune played on the piano, say, does not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40981&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720303334&quot;&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has looked into &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;our memory is so much better for sung melodies. Researchers have suggested that listening to a voice singing a melody leads us to perform “subvocalisations” — internal speech that involves tiny movements of the muscles involved in speaking (you’re probably doing it right now as you read this text). But we can’t mimic an instrumental piece in the same way. After all, it’s easy to repeat “la la la” in your head, but not to reproduce the sound of piano keys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologists already know that this kind of silent rehearsal boosts memory for words — and that memory is impaired if we speak or make movements of the mouth and tongue, which interferes with these subvocalisations. So, theorised Michael Weiss and colleagues at the University of Montreal, if a similar process is responsible for our superior memory for vocal melodies, then people’s memory should be compromised if they make other mouth movements or sounds while listening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team asked 38 participants to listen to 24 melodies, which were based on British and Irish folk tunes. Half of the tunes were played on the piano, and half were sung (as “la la la”). While listening to the melodies, half of the participants chewed gum vigorously, while the others squeezed a bean bag with their hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking a break to fill in questionnaires, the participants then completed a surprise recognition task, in which they heard the same 24 melodies as well as 24 new ones. They simply had to indicate whether or not they had heard each tune previously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar to the findings of past work, participants were better at recognising the vocal melodies than the piano ones. But this “voice advantage” was the same whether participants had been chewing gum or squeezing the bean bag while listening. That is, the chewing motion — which uses the same muscles as articulating a word— had no effect on participants’ memory, suggesting that silent rehearsal &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; responsible for their superior recognition of the sung tunes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, chewing gum is considerably different from actually mouthing words or making sounds, so might not be enough to interfere with any subvocalisations. So next, the team asked a new group of participants to either mouth “la” over and over again (without making any noise), or make a humming sound. In a subsequent study, participants whispered “la la la”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both studies, participants still recognised the vocal melodies better than the piano ones, despite making mouth movements or sounds. This again suggested that silent rehearsal of the sung melodies wasn’t responsible for boosting participants’ memories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that there wasn’t a control group in either of these studies, which makes it hard to completely rule out the possibility that making mouth movements or sounds could have &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; memory for vocal melodies, even if it didn’t entirely get rid of the memory advantage over instrumental tunes. However, the team did compare their results with an earlier study, in which participants listened to vocal and instrumental melodies &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; doing a task, and found no difference in memory performance between the two papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the studies suggest that our superior memory for sung melodies isn’t down to internal, silent rehearsal of the tunes. So what could explain the effect? Well, perhaps it’s just that humans are more attuned to voices than other sounds, the authors say. “The best current account of the voice advantage in memory remains that the voice is special, by virtue of being a conspecific, communicative, and biological signal, which is more engaging or distinctive to listeners than instrumental sounds,” they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720303334&quot;&gt;The singing voice is special: Persistence of superior memory for vocal melodies despite vocal-motor distractions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BRAIN Update: BRAIN Publication Roundup – December 2020</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improving two-color calcium imaging… Surprising evolutionary changes in interneuron types… Exploring how the basal ganglia multitasks behavior… Using mathematical models to study bat echolocation…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2826&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new variant of the calcium indicator improves two-photon imaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-photon (2P) calcium imaging has emerged as the leading method for &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; brain imaging. However, the light sources commonly used (titanium-sapphire lasers and parametric oscillators) are quite costly, require frequent maintenance, and lack output power. One solution is to use inexpensive and powerful industrial lasers that have wavelengths around 1,000 nm. But to use these inexpensive lasers, new biosensors that excite above this wavelength are needed. To these ends, researchers have been working on creating new genetically encoded calcium indicators by taking advantage of mutations that can occur in green fluorescent protein (GFP) that convert it to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.janelia.org/lab/podgorski-lab&quot;&gt;Dr. Kaspar Podgorski&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his team have created jYCaMP1 — a redshifted variant of jGCaMP7 — an optimized calcium indicator. Dr. Podgorski’s lab is a part of the Janelia Research Campus at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Their recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451475/&quot;&gt;paper shows that jYCaMP1 outperforms jGCaMP7 in both mice and flies and enables improved two-color calcium imaging with red fluorescent protein-based indicators&lt;/a&gt;. When the researchers visualized activity within the mouse visual cortex, compared to jGCaMP7s, recordings from jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons were 1.8-fold as bright. Flies were also studied for a comparative analysis. When activity in the medulla of the optic lobe of flies was visualized, jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons showed 2.3-fold increases in brightness under 1,030 nm excitation compared to the jGCaMP7s-labeled neurons. One of the most exciting results of this study is that this new calcium indicator improves two-color imaging. This is because the shifted excitation spectrum of jYCaMP1 greatly improves the overlap with red genetically encoded fluorescent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators, such as jRGECO1a, while still retaining well-separated emission with red sensors. This is critical because this new calcium indicator now allows for dual color 2P Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging with a single excitation laser. Technological advances like this are, without a doubt, the future of &lt;em&gt;in vivo &lt;/em&gt;imaging of neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution and the innovative variation of interneurons across species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While primates and rodents had a common evolutionary ancestor approximately 90 million years ago, profound differences exist in both behavior and cognitive capacity between primates and rodents. However, the cellular basis for these differences is unknown. Moreover, rodents such as mice are frequently used to understand cell types within the brain. Until now, it has been unclear whether or not these cell types have been conserved or if they have changed across evolution. In the present study, researchers sought to systemically characterize interneuron cell-type RNA expression across a variety of species. This study was led by senior researcher and professor at Harvard University, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mccarrolllab.org/&quot;&gt;Dr. Steven McCarroll&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Dr. McCarroll and his team used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile RNA expression in 188,776 individual interneurons across homologous brain regions of three primate species (i.e., human, macaque, and marmoset), mice, and ferrets. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999462/&quot;&gt;paper shows that homologous interneuron types, readily identified by their RNA-expression patterns, varied in both abundance and RNA expression among ferrets, mice, and primates&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, this variance was lower among primates. Researchers predicted that the primate caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) – a subcortical progenitor zone that gives rise to interneurons during neurodevelopment – would contain greater evolutionary novelties among interneurons because the CGE produces a larger proportion of these cells in primates than in rodents. However, they found that the divergence in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the primate species all involved interneurons for which RNA-expression patterns indicated they originated from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) domain, which is evolutionarily older than the CGE domain. Further, the team found a primate interneuron cell-type that has no homologous counterpart in mice or ferrets in the striatum, and not the cortex. Overall, this research is important because it broadens our understanding of the evolution of interneurons. Further, these findings will facilitate research for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses by helping scientists identify the species that best models cell types in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projections of the basal ganglia: beyond an integrative hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are primarily two models to explain the function of the basal ganglia, which are important nuclei involved in decision making and motor control. One model suggests this set of nuclei is a site of integration, whereas the second model suggests that projections from the basal ganglia are divided into topographical channels, each controlling a distinct behavior. The lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bernardo Sabatini&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; investigated the latter hypothesis by using a unique experimental approach. One part of the basal ganglia, the striatum, has functionally discrete roles along the medial–lateral axis, with dorsal medial striatum and dorsal lateral striatum involved in goal-directed and habitual behaviors, respectively. Dr. Sabatini’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989293/&quot;&gt;paper suggests that this dichotomy might arise, at least partially, from distinct anatomical projections from the basal ganglia that allow parallel modulation of behavior&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, rather than integrating behavior on their own, the basal ganglia multitask through multiple feedforward projections to other regions. Researchers first used anterograde tracers to map the projection pathways of the basal ganglia. Next, using an optogenetic approach, they confirmed that specific regions within the striatum triggered a single behavior (licking or locomotion). Further, when the locomotion-inducing striatal region was stimulated while mice were licking, this did not interfere with licking. These findings support the canonical parallel model of basal ganglia activity, but also suggest that the integration and competition of information associated with specific behaviors occurs largely outside of the basal ganglia. Altogether, this work extends our understanding of the basal ganglia as a complex brain region with distinct neural projections that function independently. Understanding the functional composition of these circuits is a critical step toward a better understanding of basal ganglia-related disorders, such as Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

First, AAV1-Cre is injected into dorsal medial striatum (DMS), dorsal lateral striatum (DLS), or ventral lateral striatum (VLS) of H2B-EGFP reporter mice. After 2 weeks, the Cre encoded by the virus activates H2B-EGFP expression. b) Example sections of the striatum showing the injection sites. c) Example section (left column) and average relative cell density map of H2B-EGFP-expressing cells (right column) in globus pallidus externus (GPe; left), entopeduncular nucleus (EP; middle) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; right) for injections at three different striatal sites (top, DMS; middle, DLS; bottom, VLS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bats use echolocation to predict their prey’s movements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that bats use echolocation to track moving auditory objects, such as prey, within their environment. But are bats actually using predictive tracking strategies to anticipate the future? &lt;a href=&quot;https://batlab.johnshopkins.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Cynthia Moss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and her team at Johns Hopkins University study comparative neural systems and behavior using the big brown bat (&lt;em&gt;Eptesicus fuscus)&lt;/em&gt; as a model organism. Dr. Moss and her “Batlab” team show in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33139550/&quot;&gt;new paper that bats integrate information across echo sequences to anticipate a target’s future position in a three-dimensional environment&lt;/a&gt;. To show this, the Batlab created a carefully controlled laboratory environment. They first trained bats to sit on a platform in this lab environment while the researchers manipulated the path of the insect the bats would chase. In this setting, the researchers could control the speed at which the insect moved, and high-speed cameras were used to track the movement of the bats. Then, they measured the direction of the bat’s head (i.e. sonar beam aim) and echolocation call rate as it tracked the moving target within its sonar field. The team then used four separate mathematical models to determine whether or not the bats used predictive tracking behaviors while chasing the insect target. Indeed, they found that bats use a predictive internal model to update tracking of a moving target. The results held true even when tested in a more naturalistic environment that included an object that the moving target could hide behind temporarily. By studying bats and other unique model organisms, we can better understand how humans and other animals use their own sensory information in order to make predictions about the future. Research such as this can have important implications about how individuals who are blind navigate within their environment and how we can create better devices to assist the visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: A comparison between mouse, in silico, and robot odor plume navigation reveals advantages of mouse odor-tracking</title>

	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2020/12/09/a-comparison-between-mouse-in-silico-and-robot-odor-plume-navigation-reveals-advantages-of-mouse-odor-tracking.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmucker will talk about a paper &quot;A comparison between mouse, in silico, and robot odor plume navigation reveals advantages of mouse odor-tracking&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are
adept at odor navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources
in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to
identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for
odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic
environment. To do so, we compared mouse, in silico model, and Arduino-based
robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse
performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a
shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental
complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and
klinotaxis, an in silico model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as
the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of
low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops
when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both
algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly
binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful
performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor
separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor
environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor
localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust
performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal's
ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for
odor localization&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Mediation May Help Couples Resolve Conflicts Better Than One-On-One Discussion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40971</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/08/mediation-may-help-couples-resolve-conflicts-better-than-one-on-one-discussion/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you love your partner, there are always going to be things about them that get on your nerves. These can be fairly superficial — not liking the way they fold the laundry, for example, or hating their favourite TV show. Other problems can be more serious — fundamental failures to communicate or disagreements on big decisions like having children. There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/https:/digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that we continue to repeat these patterns in new relationships, even when we hope to see a change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while all couples argue, they don’t all do it in the same way. Techniques for managing conflict have been explored by François Bogacz and team from the University of Geneva in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00622-8#Sec1&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communication&lt;/em&gt;. The study’s findings suggest that mediation — negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party such as a therapist or counsellor — may be the best way for couples to resolve serious conflict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40971&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were heterosexual romantic couples who had been in a relationship for more than one year. About a month before the experiment started, participants filled in a number of measures. The “Dyadic Adjustment Scale” was used to measure the quality of relationships, with participants indicating how often they disagree with their partner on issues ranging from religious matters, sex, and life philosophy to housework and leisure time. The scale also covered how often participants thought about separating from their partner and how often there were significant disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured participants’ emotional competence (i.e. how well a person understands their own and others’ emotions) as well as dispositional mindfulness (i.e. how present someone is able to be in the moment). Finally, participants indicated how they respond before, during and after conflicts with people in their life. These answers revealed how much participants used four different styles of conflict: active-constructive (good at taking others’ perspectives), passive-constructive (delaying and considering a response to conflict), active-destructive (openly expressing anger) and passive-destructive (avoiding conflict altogether).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Immediately before the experiment, participants also rated their mood, and indicated how close they felt to their partner at that moment. Next, they were invited to select a topic for discussion from those most commonly reported as sources of disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the control condition were then asked to discuss the controversial topic for an hour without any guidance and under the watch of a silent observer, while those in the mediation condition had their discussion facilitated by a neutral third party using a facilitative mediation model, in which partners reach a collective solution through exploring each other’s interests, feelings and outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the experiment, participants rated the level of disagreement at the end of their discussion, their level of satisfaction with the discussion and their level of satisfaction with the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of the discussion, and indicated whether or not they had actually achieved a resolution on the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that couples in the mediation condition were more likely to come to a resolution: 36 of the 38 participants in the mediation condition reported reaching an agreement compared to 26 of 38 in the control condition. Participants who had gone through the mediation process also felt closer to their partners after the discussion, while there was no change in closeness for those in the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How participants reported dealing with conflict also related to other aspects of their personality and their feelings about their relationships. Active-constructive and passive-constructive profiles were positively associated with mindfulness, while those who were passive-destructive were less likely to be mindful and present in the moment. Participants who rated themselves as more emotionally competent also tended to report being more satisfied in their relationship. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether couples would have responded in the same way in a naturalistic setting is unclear. The presence of a silent observer may have affected how participants in the control condition dealt with the conflict — screaming at your partner about their very worst qualities is likely to be pretty uncomfortable and inhibited in front of somebody else in a way it may not be at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research could focus on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; mediation works, as well as looking at different types of facilitative relationship. There are also interesting avenues to explore around the &lt;em&gt;content &lt;/em&gt;of conflicts. While on the surface an argument may appear to be about who does the dishes more, it’s likely that there are other factors at play, the washing up merely a stand-in for deeper issues about compatibility, personality or politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is clear from the study is that certain personality traits or skills can help resolve conflict. These aren’t impossible things to master — emotional competence is a focus in many types of individual therapeutic intervention. But for those who &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;happen to have those traits or struggle to foster them, mediation seems like a hopeful option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00622-8&quot;&gt;Improved conflict resolution in romantic couples in mediation compared to negotiation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Show your work. Peer-Reviewed Protocols</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Publisher, Open Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support increased sharing of open research methodologies — and in an exciting extension to our partnership with &lt;strong&gt;protocols.io&lt;/strong&gt; — we are announcing two new peer-reviewed article types in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; in 2021: &lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sign-up&lt;/a&gt; to receive updates on launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new article types are intended to address three issues familiar to researchers: the rigor and reproducibility of research, efficiency in getting feedback, and recognition for developing and sharing diverse research contributions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been developed in close collaboration with researchers and the protocols.io team. They describe &lt;em&gt;verified&lt;/em&gt;, reusable methodologies including computational techniques, and consist of two interlinked components:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A step-by-step protocol posted to protocols.io, utilizing specialized tools for communicating methodological details, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts–an array of features that facilitate the direct use of the protocol at the bench. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations, expected results and sample datasets from using the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are also introducing &lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an established article type that allows researchers to share detailed plans and proposals for funded research projects that have not yet generated results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; will be open to research in all fields of study within &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s inclusive scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why protocols, why now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many researchers share &lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols &lt;/strong&gt;informally with peers and, in our work to better understand researcher needs, we learned that a motivation for sharing protocols is to seek feedback to improve them. The importance of methods development and sharing also deserves increased recognition, via a peer-reviewed publication. Understanding the exquisite details that make methods work is also essential for reproducibility and for accelerating science. Researchers who develop methods, especially those early in their careers, deserve more recognition than a footnote in a research article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are important for improving rigor and transparency by sharing a study’s design, recruitment and analysis plans before research has been carried out. This practice is especially important — and already common — in healthcare research, including systematic reviews. Study Protocols complement our offering of Registered Reports. Researchers are not required to submit the results of their Study Protocol  to the same journal, which  provides more researchers with Open Access options to share their peer-reviewed research plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These article types in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; offer new ways to share research according to the principles of open science, bolstering transparency, reproducibility, and accelerating research. We also hope that they provide opportunities for researchers who have experienced lab closures in 2020 to remain engaged with their research, and explore more ways to demonstrate their productivity and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beginning a roadmap for improved methods papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After iterative development with researchers of a new format for &lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes prominent reciprocal linking between platforms, we will be launching the article type as a pilot in 2021. By partnering with a specialist platform in protocols.io we can offer authors enhanced functionality for sharing and displaying their protocols in actionable ways alongside the features of a peer-reviewed publication. Researchers will also benefit from dynamic functionality of protocols.io, for modifying and sharing new versions of protocols in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As another unique feature, authors of &lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; who are new users of the protocols.io platform can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols&quot;&gt;upload and format their protocols&lt;/a&gt; as part of the publication process in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During 2021 we will gather more feedback to inform potential future directions for the article format and author workflow. The launch of the pilot is the first phase of exploring continuous improvement of the experience of publishing and reading protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS and protocols.io are committed to developing our services and future plans based on community feedback. And we want to hear the full spectrum of feedback from different communities around the globe. If you have questions, feedback, or ideas please reach out to Iain Hrynaszkiewicz (ihrynaszkiewicz@plos.org) or Emma Ganley (emma@protocols.io), or leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To hear some more about peer-reviewed protocols please listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/podcasts/episode-27-dr-vronique-kiermer-plos&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this episode of the &lt;em&gt;Minor Tweak Major Impact&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt; from protocols.io where Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer at PLOS, discusses this initiative, among others things.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) among older people across Europe: findings from cross-sectional analysis of SCOPE H2020 project</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;86&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/logo-rev2-140x86.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as the presence of lasting functional abnormalities in the renal structure and function that can worsen over time. Kidneys are vital for the whole body to work properly. Therefore, when a person has CKD, they may also have problems with the functioning of the rest of their body.  Some of the common complications of CKD include anemia, bone disease, heart disease, high potassium, high calcium and fluid accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKD is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in older people, and it is associated with a huge economic burden. High income countries generally spend more than 2-3% of their annual budget on the treatment of end-stage renal disease, although people receiving such treatments represent less than 0.03% of the total population. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the prevalence of CKD is increasing and the importance of early diagnosis to prevent complications such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well established, screening programmes in Europe are highly heterogeneous and fragmented. Health system planning requires careful evaluation of the epidemiology of CKD, but data on morbidity and mortality of this disease are scarce or non-existent in many countries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCOPE (Screening for CKD among older people across Europe) H2020 project implemented in  seven European Countries plus Israel includes an observational prospective study with a 2-year follow up, recruiting 2426 older people aged 75+, to investigate whether and to which extent currently available screening methods may identify older people at risk of worsening kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from the baseline database of the SCOPE Project was made available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-20-supplement-1&quot;&gt;BMC Geriatrics Special Issue&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Fabrizia Lattanzio et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKD and Quality of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality of life (QoL) refers to the physical, psychological, social, and medical aspects of life that are influenced by health status and functions. The SCOPE team investigated the QoL among older in early stage of CKD, to identify the factors that influence this relationship. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01697-3&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that CKD and its severity may be significantly associated with impaired QoL among community-dwelling older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is kidney function associated with cognition and mood in late life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of CKD and cognitive impairment is growing as a result of the aging population. CKD, cognitive impairment, and mood disorder share common risk factors. Whether a decreased kidney function is associated with cognitive and mood disorders in the oldest old is not completely clear. Therefore, the SCOPE team has investigated for the first time the possible association between kidney function, cognition and mood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01707-4&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that the prevalence of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms  does not increase among older people in more advanced stages of CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is CKD a predictor of falls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falls are a serious negative health outcome in older persons. In facts, the fall rate rises with increasing age. However, the impact of CKD on falls in older community-dwelling persons is not well investigated yet, especially in relation to the urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The SCOPE team studied the impact of CKD and LUTS on falls as well as on injurious falls. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01698-2&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that lower urinary tract symptoms are a predictor of falls and injurious falls, while the association between CKD and falls needs to be prospectively investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKD and sarcopenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) may be more pronounced in older adults with CKD, wherein the protein albumin is abnormally present in the urine (albuminuria). The SCOPE team investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults according to kidney function and albuminuria levels. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01700-x&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that sarcopenia is common among older adults, especially those in more advanced CKD stages, even if the estimated prevalence slightly differs depending on the equation used to assess estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR); likewise, sarcopenia seems to be widespread among older people with higher albuminuria levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association between kidney function and nutritional status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different mechanisms connect the nutritional status with the occurrence and the course of CKD. Existing literature shows that especially during end-stage renal disease, there are complications that lead to malnutrition (undernutrition). However, the SCOPE team has further investigated this relationship between kidney function and nutritional status. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01699-1&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that population of community-dwelling 75+ with CKD show general features of overweight and obesity with a small prevalence of malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKD in multimorbidity patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKD is known to be associated with several co-occurring conditions. The SCOPE team has explored multimorbidity patterns, as well as the impact of physical performance and CKD severity among an older community-dwelling people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01696-4&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; results showed that CKD contributes significantly to multimorbidity patterns in a population of older outpatients and it was rarely observed without any co-occurring diseases. Moreover, CKD may cluster with hypertension and sensory impairments, but its contribution to multimorbidity pattern may be affected by CKD severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientific results prompt to further improve the screening methods for CKD in the older population and the models of assistance and care through longitudinal studies. The early diagnosis of CKD represents a priority issue to be addressed to prevent / slow its progression among older patients and, at the same time, to reduce the need for long-term care and the related cost for the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Narcissism Can Have Both A Positive And Negative Impact On New Mothers’ Wellbeing, Longitudinal Study Finds</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/07/narcissism-can-have-both-a-positive-and-negative-impact-on-new-mothers-wellbeing-longitudinal-study-finds/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens to a narcissistic woman when she becomes a mother? Can someone with an unmet desire for attention, love and recognition — which characterises all narcissists — adapt well to having a baby to care for? The answer, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-74084-001&quot;&gt;new study &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment,&lt;/em&gt; is that it really depends what type of narcissist the mother is. And even, then, the conclusions were based on self-reports, which should probably be received with caution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40960&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is generally thought to come in two types. Grandiose narcissists crave admiration, lack empathy, feel more envy than is typical, and have an inflated sense of their own self-worth and entitlement. Vulnerable narcissists share some of these traits, but, in contrast, they are fundamentally insecure, often expressing a sense of inadequacy, and more negative emotions, including shame and hostility to others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anat Talmon at Stanford University and colleagues studied 385 Israeli woman, recruited via general online forums dedicated to pregnancy and the transition to motherhood. The participants completed a battery of tests while they were pregnant, and also two months after giving birth. These tests assessed both types of narcissism, along with participants’ general psychological wellbeing, how they felt about their bodies, their own evaluations of their adequacy as a mother (and their predictions of this, before the birth), perceived attachment and bonding with their babies, and also their levels of positive and negative emotion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that the women who ranked relatively high on the grandiose narcissism scale also reported high levels of wellbeing in the transition to motherhood. Vulnerable narcissism, however, was associated with higher levels of distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that grandiose women are more inclined to view their baby as an extension of themselves, the researchers write — so feel more positively about it. This idea is perhaps supported by their finding that this group reported stronger attachment to their babies, and that it was this sense of attachment that seemed to lead to greater wellbeing among these women. The team also found that grandiose women tended to have a relatively poorer body experience during pregnancy, however (perhaps because of fatigue or weight gain, for example) but more positive attitudes to their body after giving birth. This particular effect “may be attributed to the grandiose experience of bringing a child into the world,” the researchers observe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that women with vulnerable narcissism clearly fared less well, however. They reported relatively more negative feelings about their own bodies, more distress, lower anticipated and actual efficacy as a mother, and greater difficulty bonding with their newborn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To the best of our knowledge, our findings provide the first evidence of how the two components of narcissism respond differently to the adjustment to motherhood,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are, though, some limitations to their study. Most notably, all of the data came from the women’s own self-reports. This raises various questions, such as: did the grandiose mothers really form stronger attachments to their babies — or did they just like to think that they did? Indeed, other studies have found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280102005_THE_RELATIONSHIP_BETWEEN_PARENTAL_NARCISSISM_AND_CHILDREN'S_MENTAL_VULNERABILITY_THE_MEDIATION_ROLE_OF_THE_REARING_STYLE&quot;&gt;narcissistic parents show lower levels of care for their children&lt;/a&gt; (who are then at higher risk of developing anxiety and depression) and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-015-9672-3&quot;&gt;more likely to physically abuse their children&lt;/a&gt;. As the authors themselves write, “The idea that a grandiose individual might tend to be somewhat disconnected from her actual mental state could shed light on the report of increased levels of wellbeing during this challenging transitional period.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the work certainly does contribute to research on how a woman’s personality contributes to her feelings about herself, and her baby, during and just after pregnancy. The “unique contribution made by each type of narcissism highlights the nuanced way in which we should observe individuals,” the team notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-74084-001&quot;&gt;“I will love you (me) forever”—A longitudinal study of narcissism and emotional adjustment during the transition to motherhood.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: news: MLA 2021 Session on “Towards Sustainability for Digital Archives and Projects” | SHARP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sharpweb.org/main/mla-2021-session-on-towards-sustainability-for-digital-archives-and-projects/</guid>
	<link>https://www.sharpweb.org/main/mla-2021-session-on-towards-sustainability-for-digital-archives-and-projects/</link>
	<description>[This is the abstract for just one of seven presentations.]

Abstract:  Over the last decade, the digital humanities community has become increasingly concerned with the ongoing sustainability of digital projects. This anxiety stems in part from the realization that not all digital humanities projects have identical expectations of longevity. Several prominent works in the literature, such as Bethany Nowviskie and Dot Porter’s “Graceful Degradation Survey Findings: How Do We Manage Digital Humanities Projects through Times of Transition and Decline?” (2010) and Geoffrey Rockwell et al.’s “Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the Globalization Compendium” (2014), have been central to this intellectual exchange about the benefits of creating sustainability plans for projects that do not necessarily assume a default permanence, but that instead proactively consider each project’s most suitable longevity strategy.

 

With this realization has come a concomitant expectation: each digital humanities project must create its own customized sustainability plan, designed with its particular requirements in mind. And yet, few digital humanists have access to direct training on the process of creating and implementing professional-grade digital preservation and sustainability practices for their own work. To support the process of designing and implementing digital sustainability plans for this work, a team of scholars housed in the Visual Media Workshop at the University of Pittsburgh has created the Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap (STSR; http://sustainingdh.net). The STSR is a structured, process-oriented workshop, inspired by design thinking and collaborative learning approaches. This workshop, which may be implemented in a variety of institutional contexts, guides project stakeholders through the practice of creating effective, iterative, ongoing digital sustainability strategies that address the needs of both social and technological infrastructures. It is founded on the fundamental assumption that, for sustainability practices to be successful, project leaders must keep the changing, socially-contingent nature of both their project and their working environment(s) consistently in mind as they initiate, maintain, and support their own work. For this panel, we contextualize and describe the STSR, and provide reflections based on our experiences facilitating Sustaining DH: An NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interview technique known as “Asymmetric Information Management” provides a pretty effective way to spot liars&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/spotting-liars-is-hard-but-our-new-method-is-effective-and-ethical-151035&quot;&gt;writes researcher Cody Porter&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. The method basically involves explaining to the interviewee that it will be easier to figure out if they are lying or telling the truth if they provide longer, more detailed statements, Porter explains. Liars will tend to withhold information to try and hide their lie, while truth-tellers will provide detailed information as requested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40951&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier this year, a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/28/why-do-video-game-players-invert-the-controls&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; explored why some video game players choose to invert their controls, so that pressing “up” makes their character look downwards. &lt;/strong&gt;Now, inspired by the heated debate that followed, psychologists Jennifer Corbett and Jaap Munneke have decided to study the phenomenon in more detail, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/02/scientists-studying-why-gamers-invert-their-controls&quot;&gt;Keith Stuart reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We often think that experiencing set-backs and failures will make eventual success seem even sweeter — but that may not always be true, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-failure-make-victory-seem-sweeter/&quot;&gt;writes researcher Hallgeir Sjåstad&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. People who were told they performed poorly on a “practice” cognitive test predicted that they would feel &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; happiness or pride if they scored highly on the real test, compared to those who were told they performed well at practice. However, all participants showed equally high happiness when they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; received a top score.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new paper argues that both severe stress and psycheledic drugs can produce “pivotal mental states”, during which our personality and mental health are more prone to changing.&lt;/strong&gt; These states are neither good nor bad in themselves but can lead to positive or negative outcomes depending on the context in which they occur, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/on-pivotal-mental-states&quot;&gt;writes Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt;, who examines the paper with a critical eye over at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This year has seen its fair share of conspiracy theories — but what’s the best way to respond to someone who is sharing misinformation? &lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/29/how-to-deal-with-a-conspiracy-theorist-5g-covid-plandemic-qanon&quot;&gt;David Robson explains five forms of faulty reasoning&lt;/a&gt; that often underlie conspiracy theories, and how to respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delirium is believed to worsen cognitive decline and increase the risk of developing dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;But it is also a common symptom of severe Covid-19. So could the virus raise the risk of developing long-term neurocognitive problems? At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03360-8&quot;&gt;Carrie Arnold talks to the researchers who are trying to find out&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Contrasting views:  Whether to Order a CT Scan with Contrast or Not</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12207</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/12/03/ct-scan-with-contrast/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;friendly doctor talking to patient . CT Scan in hospital&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/CT-Scan-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the era of protocol-driven care, straightforward guidelines are often desired but can result in oversimplification of the decision. That has been the case for use of iin individuals with kidney disease. Instead of weighing the risk of contrast administration on a case-by-case basis, there seems to be a default to a recommendation against the use of contrast. This has resulted in patients with kidney disease not getting the necessary studies leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast. The variable definitions for diagnosis and the previous use of high osmolar agents resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2017.03.003&quot;&gt;high incidence of acute kidney injury&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind, this diagnosis was often based on the labs and clinical scenario without confirmatory kidney biopsy findings. Biopsies may show features of acute tubular necrosis, but there is no distinguishing feature to implicate iodinated contrast exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review of larger administrative databases cannot reproduce the higher rates of acute kidney injury. In a larger series, using propensity scores comparing 116,694 who received contrast for CT scans with 40,446 who did not receive contrast. There was &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015154044&quot;&gt;no increase in absolute risk of kidney injury&lt;/a&gt;. Another review of an administrative inpatient database of 5.9 million individuals with comorbidities by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2016010021&quot;&gt;Wilheml-Leen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated the risk of acute kidney injury was nearly the same regardless of the use of IV contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of iso-osmolar/low molecular weight agents has resulted in lower rates of contrast-induced kidney injury. Identification of factors such as underlying CKD stage 4 or 5, use of higher osmolar agents, intra-arterial administration of the contrast, concomitant hemodynamic instability, use of a large volume of contrast, and pre-existing volume depletion would help practitioners better predict the risk of contrast use. The risk for an individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; receiving iodinated contrast for a CT scan of the chest to evaluate a pulmonary nodule is not the same as the individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; who presents with acute myocardial infarction and hemodynamic instability needing an emergent cardiac catheterization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recommendations for contrast use in these two cases should not be the same. Contrast-induced nephrotoxic injury can occur but the risk is not the same for all situations. Our approach should be a more thoughtful review of the individual clinical situation and an assessment of whether the benefit of the information gained from the study outweighs the risk. Additionally, there should be a dialogue with patients about the decision-making process rather than simplified guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
