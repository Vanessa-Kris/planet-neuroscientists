	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we wrote about a somewhat remarkable retraction, of a 15-year-old paper by a current Illinois senator who used to be a mathematician. At the time, we were a bit perplexed by the language of the notice, which the senator — who helpfully took our call — couldn’t answer, since he wasn’t involved in […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a parent asks their child plenty of “who?”, “what?”, “when?”, “where?”, “why?” questions, encourages them to go into detail and includes open-ended questions, psychologists call this an elaborative style. Past research has shown that children with parents like this tend to remember more experiences from their lives (the opposite parental style is to ask fewer questions in general, and to ask questions that only need a short, basic response). More specific studies have found that parents’ elaborative chat can also help their children remember museum visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096516302296&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Child Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is the first to apply this line of research to young children’s memories of a recent science lesson. The findings provide tentative evidence that conversing with a child in an elaborative way could help them remember more about their lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19637&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Leichtman and her colleagues at the University of New Hampshire, USA, recruited the mothers or fathers of 40 children aged four to six from two schools, one in an upper middle-class area, the other lower middle-class. A scientist visited the children’s schools and gave an engaging, scripted lesson with props about the science of light. That evening, the researchers asked the parents to chat with their child about the lesson in whatever way they found natural, and to record the chat. Six days later, the researchers interviewed each child about the science lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an indirect link between parents’ use of an elaborative conversational style and how much their child remembered of the science lesson six days later. That is, the more elaborative the parents’ questioning, the more details the children tended to recall the evening of the lesson. In turn, children who provided more detail when chatting to their parents also tended to remember more of the lesson (including new details they hadn’t mentioned previously) when chatting to a researcher about the lesson six days later. This was true for children from both schools and regardless of the parents’ own educational background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one direct link between parents’ conversational style and children’s later recall in the researcher interview, and that was the amount of descriptive words that the parents used (such as “Was the flashlight &lt;em&gt;blue&lt;/em&gt;?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is very preliminary and needs replication. It’s correlational nature means we can’t know if parents are influencing children or if children are influencing parents. It might be both, and certainly, given the wider related research literature, it’s plausible that parents’ conversational style is having an influence. Leichtman and her colleagues highlighted several possible ways parents’ elaborative conversational style might have a benefit, including not only through encouraging greater recall, discussion and ways to connect ideas, but also at a motivational level, “impart[ing] to children a sense that the topic and details are worthy of their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking selfies makes us feel self-conscious and sends tremors through our self-esteem, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917300715&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;. One group of undergraduates at Yonsei University in Seoul used their phone’s camera to take a selfie, while a control group photographed a cup on a desk. Afterwards selfie takers showed signs of increased social sensitivity, at least according to a test that involved detecting the direction of arrows on a computer screen. The arrows appeared in locations previously occupied by the features of a face and the idea was that participants would be more focused on these facial features, and thus quicker to detect the arrows, if they were in a socially vigilant state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that selfie takers showed enhanced social sensitivity (they were quicker to detect the arrows) is consistent with the way that our social sensitivity goes up when we are in front of a mirror or when someone else points a video camera at us, making us acutely aware of the imperfections we have on show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, graduate students at the university, used this indirect measure to assess social sensitivity because they thought people might not respond honestly if they were simply asked how they were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the researchers used an indirect measure to test if taking a selfie affected participants’ self-esteem, specifically whether it shrunk their written signature compared to its size at the start of the study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/23/a-bigger-signature-correlates-with-social-bravado-and-narcissism/&quot;&gt;past research has linked bigger signatures with greater self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;). It did, but only for selfies &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; posted to social media, but simply saved to the phone. The authors speculated that the act of taking a selfie hurts self-esteem by bringing feelings about personal imperfections to the fore, but this wound can be salved through the self-promotional aspect of sharing your image to the wider world. On this reading, selfie-taking is a self-esteem rollercoaster, one that might put you back more or less where you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplace bullying can corrode organisations and wreck individual lives. Research has revealed more and more about effects on victims and the motives of the perpetrators. But bullying is often a performance that demands an audience: you can’t ostracise someone from an empty room, or gossip about them to the wind. So it’s worth looking at the third ingredient in the bullying mix: the bystander. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2016.1152213&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; takes on this task, looking at the factors that dispose a bystander against bullying victims, and what might encourage them to step in and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19584&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Netherlands-based Open University recruited 161 working adults and presented each with a hypothetical workplace vignette, in which the victim was interrupted, belittled, excluded and gossiped about by a bullying colleague. In one condition, the victim was proactive, daring the bully to criticise them to their face or demanding they cease their behaviour. In another, the victim avoided the situation, by skipping out when the bully entered a room, or by taking sick leave to avoid work entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were cast as bystanders to these contrasting situations, and Roelie Mulder’s team predicted that they would have a more negative view of the avoidant victims. Stigma research shows that people are less sympathetic to the suffering of others when they perceive they haven’t taken opportunities to improve their situation. Consistent with this, participants said they would feel more anger towards an avoidant victim, and considered them to hold much more responsibility for their predicament. Proactive victims were additionally seen as more self-reliant. So it might appear that proactivity is a good move if you want to get bystanders on-side and willing to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that’s not the case. Participants were also asked to report how likely they would be to step in and help the victim, and they showed no greater willingness to help proactive ones. There’s a grim logic behind this: the more responsible a victim was seen to be for being bullied, the less participants wanted to help. But bystanders were also less likely to help victims they saw as self-reliant, presumably because they felt less of a pressing need to do so. You either don’t need help, or you don’t deserve it, a classic catch-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proactivity appears admirable from the outside: in past work, most people said they would prefer to stand up to hypothetical bullies, and victims looking back on events often wish they had done so. But the reality is that when we find ourselves in these situations, it isn’t so easy – avoidance is the more common strategy – and what’s more, proactivity isn’t always the wisest choice. If you lose your cool, you could be at risk of formal consequences. And even if you play it well, a confronted bully might just double down on their behaviour. A proactive victim might be the one most in need of help, but bystanders don’t see it that way. So if you’re coming out fighting, bear in mind that you may also need to explicitly ask for help from those who seem sympathetic, but haven’t realised the need to throw their hat into the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2016.1152213&quot;&gt;Workplace mobbing: How the victim’s coping behavior influences bystander responses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Predicting medical students who will struggle based on their admissions characteristics</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/22/predicting-medical-students-will-struggle-based-admissions-characteristics/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/iStock_000012644846Medium-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many debates about the best way to select people into medical school, but one of the questions I ponder is how do we judge the success of such selection processes? There are a few problems in doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there’s the ‘restriction of range’ problem. The people who don’t get into medical school are often lost to follow-up. We cannot easily set up an experiment to see how they might have got on in medical school, had they been admitted. This means the students we follow are only those who were successful in the selection process. So, simple correlations between selection measures and intra-medical school measures can usually only distinguish the successful from the very successful. The simplest correlations are between selection measures and assessment outcomes – many have done that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-016-0779-x&quot;&gt;including us&lt;/a&gt;. It’s helpful but not the whole answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another measure could relate to our social responsibilities – the extent to which our selection processes match the health needs of our societies in which we practise. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2012/vol-125-no-1361/article-crampton&quot;&gt;Otago medical school&lt;/a&gt; has adopted the ‘mirror on society’ principle where we aim for the demographic makeup of the medical school class to match the demographic makeup of our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These areas generally try to predict success, but a third area to research is to predict difficulty. This area was the focus of our article &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0879-2&quot;&gt;published this week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even here though, there are challenges for researchers as, in general, medical students are motivated and capable – so they mostly achieve well in medical school. This means the outcome of interest in our research (students who have difficulty in the course) are relatively infrequent –this is a desirable educational outcome, but it is a hindrance in research design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a more &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6920-11-29&quot;&gt;programmatic approach&lt;/a&gt; to assessment at the University of Otago, we keep a fairly close eye on our students and like to have sensitive measures of difficulty – we’d rather find a few who might be struggling but turn out to be doing well, than to miss a few who later get into bother. Our system is more sensitive than specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…we’d rather find a few who might be struggling but turn out to be doing well, than to miss a few who later get into bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that students who are new to the country and have had less time to acculturate are at greater risk of developing problems, as are those with lower academic grades at entry and those with lower scores on the component of an aptitude test that measures understanding people. Men ran into more problems than women but no ethnic group was at greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as it pains me to say it, men are at greater risk of running into difficulty during their course but we’re not about to use gender as a selection measure! Although we keep trying to deny it, whichever way we look at it, academic grades still seem to be a good measure of success and difficulty – I guess doctors need to be smart. However, they also need to understand the society in which they will practise and understand people – these are measures on which we should place a greater focus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Immune cells known as T cells can destroy tumour cells, but their clinical use requires complex preparation and the cells can lose effectiveness over time. A new approach might improve the efficiency of T-cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21506&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21506&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/X9dK9uT5P6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ageing is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease caused by the rupture of inflamed cholesterol plaques in arteries. It emerges that this might be partly due to genetic mutations that cause cancerous changes in white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21505&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21505&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/kowT99peu-0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Elucidation of the biosynthesis of the methane catalyst coenzyme F430</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21427</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA–CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus with CRISPR/Cas9 enhances tumour rejection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21405</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect and reprogram T cells to mediate tumour rejection. The most successful CARs used to date are those targeting CD19 (ref. 2), which offer the prospect of complete remission in patients with chemorefractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. CARs are typically transduced into the T cells of a patient using γ-retroviral vectors or other randomly integrating vectors, which may result in clonal expansion, oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and transcriptional silencing. Recent advances in genome editing enable efficient sequence-specific interventions in human cells, including targeted gene delivery to the CCR5 and AAVS1 loci. Here we show that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus not only results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, but also enhances T-cell potency, with edited cells vastly outperforming conventionally generated CAR T cells in a mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We further demonstrate that targeting the CAR to the TRAC locus averts tonic CAR signalling and establishes effective internalization and re-expression of the CAR following single or repeated exposure to antigen, delaying effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion. These findings uncover facets of CAR immunobiology and underscore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to advance immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21405&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21405&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/9nXAWXGgJa0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Editing and methylation at a single site by functionally interdependent activities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21396</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Nucleic acids undergo naturally occurring chemical modifications. Over 100 different modifications have been described and every position in the purine and pyrimidine bases can be modified; often the sugar is also modified. Despite recent progress, the mechanism for the biosynthesis of most modifications is not fully understood, owing, in part, to the difficulty associated with reconstituting enzyme activity in vitro. Whereas some modifications can be efficiently formed with purified components, others may require more intricate pathways. A model for modification interdependence, in which one modification is a prerequisite for another, potentially explains a major hindrance in reconstituting enzymatic activity in vitro. This model was prompted by the earlier discovery of tRNA cytosine-to-uridine editing in eukaryotes, a reaction that has not been recapitulated in vitro and the mechanism of which remains unknown. Here we show that cytosine 32 in the anticodon loop of Trypanosoma brucei tRNAThr is methylated to 3-methylcytosine (m3C) as a pre-requisite for C-to-U deamination. Formation of m3C in vitro requires the presence of both the T. brucei m3C methyltransferase TRM140 and the deaminase ADAT2/3. Once formed, m3C is deaminated to 3-methyluridine (m3U) by the same set of enzymes. ADAT2/3 is a highly mutagenic enzyme, but we also show that when co-expressed with the methyltransferase its mutagenicity is kept in check. This helps to explain how T. brucei escapes ‘wholesale deamination’ of its genome while harbouring both enzymes in the nucleus. This observation has implications for the control of another mutagenic deaminase, human AID, and provides a rationale for its regulation.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Reconstitution of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum network with purified components</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21387</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Organelles display characteristic morphologies that are intimately tied to their cellular function, but how organelles are shaped is poorly understood. The endoplasmic reticulum is particularly intriguing, as it comprises morphologically distinct domains, including a dynamic network of interconnected membrane tubules. Several membrane proteins have been implicated in network formation, but how exactly they mediate network formation and whether they are all required are unclear. Here we reconstitute a dynamic tubular membrane network with purified endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Proteoliposomes containing the membrane-fusing GTPase Sey1p (refs 6, 7) and the curvature-stabilizing protein Yop1p (refs 8, 9) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae form a tubular network upon addition of GTP. The tubules rapidly fragment when GTP hydrolysis of Sey1p is inhibited, indicating that network maintenance requires continuous membrane fusion and that Yop1p favours the generation of highly curved membrane structures. Sey1p also forms networks with other curvature-stabilizing proteins, including reticulon and receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs) from different species. Atlastin, the vertebrate orthologue of Sey1p, forms a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent network on its own, serving as both a fusion and curvature-stabilizing protein. Our results show that organelle shape can be generated by a surprisingly small set of proteins and represents an energy-dependent steady state between formation and disassembly.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Prefrontal cortex output circuits guide reward seeking through divergent cue encoding</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated behaviours across mammalian species. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity, prefrontal projection neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward-seeking behaviours, such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus. While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive behaviours, how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode reward-relevant information to guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these neurons display diverse activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive cues. However, recordings from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive cues, such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across learning. By contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new, primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation of corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after learning, while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Intragenic DNA methylation prevents spurious transcription initiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21373</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Complement drives glucosylceramide accumulation and tissue inflammation in Gaucher disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21368</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 mutations drive extensive accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) in multiple innate and adaptive immune cells in the spleen, liver, lung and bone marrow, often leading to chronic inflammation. The mechanisms that connect excess GC to tissue inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that activation of complement C5a and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) controls GC accumulation and the inflammatory response in experimental and clinical Gaucher disease. Marked local and systemic complement activation occurred in GCase-deficient mice or after pharmacological inhibition of GCase and was associated with GC storage, tissue inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Whereas all GCase-inhibited mice died within 4–5 weeks, mice deficient in both GCase and C5aR1, and wild-type mice in which GCase and C5aR were pharmacologically inhibited, were protected from these adverse effects and consequently survived. In mice and humans, GCase deficiency was associated with strong formation of complement-activating GC-specific IgG autoantibodies, leading to complement activation and C5a generation. Subsequent C5aR1 activation controlled UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase production, thereby tipping the balance between GC formation and degradation. Thus, extensive GC storage induces complement-activating IgG autoantibodies that drive a pathway of C5a generation and C5aR1 activation that fuels a cycle of cellular GC accumulation, innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and activation in Gaucher disease. As enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies are expensive and still associated with inflammation, increased risk of cancer and Parkinson disease, targeting C5aR1 may serve as a treatment option for patients with Gaucher disease and, possibly, other lysosomal storage diseases.

	<title>Ankur Sinha: Using Wallabag to manage your online reading list</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ankursinha.in,2017-02-20:/blog/2017/02/20/using-wallabag-to-manage-your-online-reading-list.html</guid>
	<link>http://ankursinha.in/blog/2017/02/20/using-wallabag-to-manage-your-online-reading-list.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I always have quite a bit on my pending list to read - academic papers, blogs, planets, and the sort. Usually, when I go through the planets, such as the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://fedoraplanet.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://planet.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; or the two neuroscience planets I use - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;, I don't have the time to read all the articles right then. I used to either bookmark links, or note them down somewhere to read later. One day, though, I ran into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you save the article to read later and makes it available to you on multiple devices. It's extremely convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the one issue with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; is that it isn't &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;Free software&lt;/a&gt;. So, like I do, I went looking for an alternative. After a few hours, I ran into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wallabag.org/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. It's written in PHP, and is licensed under the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite easy to deploy, and there's a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag&quot;&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; where you can get some help too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You either enter the URL in the Wallabag page manually, or you can use the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wallabagger/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallabagger/gbmgphmejlcoihgedabhgjdkcahacjlj&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/wallabagger/?display=en&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; addon - it let's you right click a page or a link and &quot;Wallabag.it!&quot;. There's also a bookmarklet, which you can use with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/5digits/dactyl&quot;&gt;Pentadactyl&lt;/a&gt;, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code bash literal-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Add to ~/.pentadactylrc
&lt;/span&gt;command! wallabagit -description &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Add to wallabag&quot;&lt;/span&gt; open javascript:&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;var%20url&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;location.href&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;var%20wllbg&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;window.open&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://app.wallabag.it/bookmarklet?url='&lt;/span&gt;%20+%20encodeURI&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'_blank'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;})()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallabag fetches the text of the page and stores it for you so that you can read it later. You can even organise your saved pages with tags and the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the Wallabag main page&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive align-center&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a page that I'm trying to read later, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot showing an article in Wallabag&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive align-center&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played with a deployment, but decided not to deploy and maintain an instance myself. Instead, I signed up for the instance Wallabag have here - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wallabag.it/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag.it&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite cheap - they have an offer going too at the moment - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://wallabag.org/en/news/wallabagit&quot;&gt;only 9€ for an entire year&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallabag uses a the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://fivefilters.org/content-only/&quot;&gt;FiveFilters Full Text RSS tool&lt;/a&gt; to extract the text and other data from web pages. Some websites require special instructions to tell the tool what information needs to be extracted - this tends to happen with a few academic websites. There's a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config&quot;&gt;repository of such config files here&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you do run into a website that isn't rendering properly, you can &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/errors_during_fetching.html&quot;&gt;troubleshoot the issue and submit a config file too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to deploy an instance yourself, or use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wallabag.it/en&quot;&gt;Wallabag.it&lt;/a&gt;, I think it's a really useful tool to have. Of course, don't forget to install the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;app on your phone&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although it’s the right thing to do, it’s never easy to admit error — particularly when you’re an extremely high-profile scientist whose work is being dissected publicly. So while it’s not a retraction, we thought this was worth noting: A Nobel Prize-winning researcher has admitted on a blog that he relied on weak studies in a […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1970s, eight mentally well people, including psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosenhan&quot;&gt;David Rosenhan&lt;/a&gt;, presented themselves at psychiatric hospitals, where they showed signs of mild anxiety and complained of auditory hallucinations, specifically words like “empty” and “hollow”. All were admitted and either diagnosed with schizophrenia or, in one case, manic depression, and, despite acting “normal” after arrival, they were kept in hospital for an average of 19 days. On discharge all were described as having schizophrenia (or depression) “in remission”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Rosenhan’s classic study “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment&quot;&gt;On Being Sane in Insane Places&lt;/a&gt;” which he claimed showed the stigmatising power of psychiatric labels and the inability of psychiatric staff to distinguish normality from supposed abnormality, as have many others since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from a methodological perspective, the study was problematic for a number of reasons and Rosenhan’s interpretation has been hotly disputed. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Great_Myths_of_Popular_Psychology&quot;&gt;highly regarded book on psychology myths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lilienfeld&quot;&gt;Scott Lilienfeld&lt;/a&gt; and his co-authors discuss the problem with Rosenhan’s study at length, such as the fact that in the 70s “in remission” was a very rare discharge diagnosis that actually showed psychiatric staff had realised the “pseudo patients” were mentally well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Lilienfeld et al argue that it is a myth that “psychiatric labels cause harm by stigmatising people” and that the overly gullible interpretation of the Rosenhan study has helped propagate this myth. Others may disagree, but it’s at least fair to say that Rosenhan’s study had serious issues and that not all psychologists agree that psychiatric labels are in themselves harmful (consider too &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/02/on-being-labelled-schizophrenic-in-the-words-of-the-diagnosed/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that’s found that while clients say psychiatric labels can be difficult to deal with, they can also be beneficial in some ways, in terms of helping them understand their experiences and helping them to access appropriate treatments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how is this classic study covered in textbooks relating to clinical psychology and mental health (the sub-discipline usually referred to on university courses as “abnormal psychology”)? In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628317692634&quot;&gt;new survey&lt;/a&gt; of 12 contemporary abnormal psych textbooks in the journal &lt;em&gt;Teaching of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Jared Bartels and Daniel Peters found that half of them still give space to Rosenhan’s flawed study, but only two include any criticism or alternative interpretation of it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small survey and we’re not told the titles of the books, but the findings suggest that the problem of uncritical textbook coverage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/foundations-sand&quot;&gt;social psychology’s classic, myth-like studies&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/&quot;&gt;Stanford Prison Experiment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/&quot;&gt;Milgram’s “obedience research”&lt;/a&gt;, may also extend to the realm of classic mental health-related research. Is it that textbook authors are unaware of the criticisms of the Rosenhan study? Possibly, although Bartels and Peters surmise that perhaps authors know of the issues and alternative interpretations, but that these “shortcomings … are considered less important than the edifying message of the stigmatising effect of labels”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628317692634&quot;&gt;Coverage of Rosenhan’s “On Being Sane in Insane Places” in Abnormal Psychology Textbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>When the psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach blotted ink onto paper to produce a series of abstract patterns, could he have known that nearly 100 years later, the Rorschach test would be a household name?



Although the use of the Rorschach to diagnose mental illness is mostly a thing of the past, research on the test continues. Last week, two new papers were published on the Rorschach blots, including a fractal analysis of the images themselves and a brain scanning study using fMRI.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The author of a 2016 paper has agreed to retract it after an investigation revealed that most of the article came from another research group at the same university. According to the notice, the author based the majority of his paper on results generated by other scientists without their permission. Here’s the retraction notice for “Controlled synthesis […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Multi-contact synapses for stable networks: a spike-timing dependent model of dendritic spine plasticity and turnover</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he discusses the pre-print paper, &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05730&quot;&gt;Multi-contact synapses for stable networks: a spike-timing dependent model of dendritic spine plasticity and turnover (Deger, M., Seeholzer, A., Gerstner, W. (2016))&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synaptic connections in the adult neocortex consist of multiple synaptic contacts, almost exclusively formed on dendritic spines. Changes of dendritic spine shape and volume, a correlate of synaptic strength, can be tracked in vivo for weeks. Here, we present a combined model of spike-timing dependent dendritic spine plasticity and turnover that explains the steady state multi-contact configuration of synapses in adult neocortical networks. In this model, many presynaptic neurons compete to make strong synaptic connections onto postsynaptic neurons, while the synaptic contacts comprising each connection cooperate via postsynaptic firing. We demonstrate that the model is consistent with experimentally observed long-term dendritic spine dynamics under steady-state and lesion induced conditions, and show that cooperation of multiple synaptic contacts is crucial for stable, long-term synaptic memories. In simulations of a simplified network of barrel cortex, our plasticity rule reproduces whisker-trimming induced rewiring of thalamo-cortical and recurrent synaptic connectivity on realistic time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/skin-222664_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, our cells reduce their ability to regenerate as effectively, pigmentation increases, and wrinkles emerge. All of us experience some form of detriment to the skin, which cosmetic companies seek to re-mediate. For less of us, aging on the skin poses more serious issues such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our metabolism is key to supporting the function of the skin, such as the regulation of collagen and water. However, very little is currently known about metabolic alterations in aged skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing metabolic changes at the genomic level can lead to new solutions to prevent age induced skin disorders. In the scientific community, it is well established that gene expression adaptions and metabolic changes accompany skin degradation. It has been observed that DNA repair capacities reduce, and methylation changes lead to decreased cellular plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3547-3&quot;&gt;Recently published research&lt;/a&gt; from ETH Zurich provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptions of aging skin, and may benefit cosmetic companies to devise new solutions for age induced skin deterioration. These adaptions were observed in young (20-25 year old) and old (55-66 years old) human females by analyzing the RNA and metabolites of their skin’s epidermis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key discovery in the aged skin was the reduction of Q10; a coenzyme present within most animals. Often found within eukaryotic cells, Q10 is protein soluble, and can be seen in the market place as a health supplement for regulating energy in the body. Observed alterations to the processing of glucose (glycolysis), the reduced biosynthesis of protein and the organic compound polyamine are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Q10 decreased, there was a rise in the levels of taurine, the bio-marker cresol, and α-CEHC – the vitamin E metabolite. Metabolites for Vitamin E play an important role by providing anti-oxidative functions and preventing oxidative damage induced by UV energy. Most amino acid metabolites accumulated with age, helping to counteract dry skin by promoting moisturization of the epidermis, as the authors discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying metabolome and transcriptome analyses to human epidermal samples has provided insight into the metabolic adaptions associated with skin aging. Various metabolites are observed to have remedial effects on aging skin, which may help improve anti-aging skin products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a good doctor encounters research comparing the effectiveness of drugs A and B, she knows to beware the fact that B was created by the people paying the researchers’ salaries. Pharmaceutical industry funding can be complex, but the general principle of declaring financial conflicts of interest is now embedded in medical research culture. Unfortunately, research into psychological therapies doesn’t yet seem to have got its house in order in an equivalent way. That’s according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010606.long&quot;&gt;new open access article&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt; which suggests that, while there is less risk in this field of financially-based conflicts, researchers may be particularly vulnerable to non-financial biases, a problem that hasn’t been adequately acknowledged until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19408&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Klaus Lieb of the University of Mainz, examined 95 systematic and meta-analytic reviews that had evaluated the efficacy of psychological therapies by looking at the weight of evidence across multiple randomised controlled trials. Such reviews are generally used to give a balanced picture of what really works, above and beyond a single trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journals that publish this kind of research tend to be on the look out for financial conflicts of interest that could lead to a bias: for example, if the author of a meta-analysis of Therapy X was a license-holder for that therapy but chose not to declare that interest when reviewing it. Indeed, Lieb and his team found that four out of every five journals they investigated had explicitly asked that such conflicts be declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only a third of the journals asked the same of non-financial conflicts of interest, such as a review author being trained in one specific therapy, or otherwise being a particular advocate of one over others. Lieb and his colleagues argue that this presents a real problem because unlike a pharmaceutical researcher who becomes disenchanted with their favoured drug, “psychotherapy researchers who realise that the effect of the therapy to which they are allied is less beneficial than another therapy cannot easily switch their research programme to another therapy (since they have often been trained in that therapy for many years)”. This is especially true if they have been on record as a cheerleader for a particular therapy, or as a critic of its alternatives. Incidentally, at the end of their paper, Lieb and his colleagues act by example, providing a thorough outline of their own therapeutic training and related information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these conflicts may be especially pernicious for psychological therapies, and the fact that so few journals ask for declarations of these kind of allegiances is alarming. Even in cases where journals had asked for this information, only four researchers volunteered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this just means these conflicts are thankfully rare? This seems unlikely. Lieb’s team found that 34 of the reviews covered at least one and sometimes many more experimental studies authored by the reviewers themselves: not a crime in of itself, but a sign of at least a potential conflict. What’s more, Lieb’s group investigated these 34 reviews using a standard protocol to check for signs of “research allegiance”, that is whether the article betrayed a belief in the superiority of a treatment. Fifteen of the 34 reviews met these criteria, meaning that one or more of the authors had a vested interest in the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieb and a co-author, Jan von der Osten-Sacken, also read through anonymised versions of all 95 reviews and labelled a conclusion as “spinned” when they felt it wasn’t consistent with the empirical results reported. Based on this, they claimed that reviews they’d identified earlier as having non-financial conflicts also tended to have biased conclusions. However, this link wasn’t statistically significant, so at best this tentative finding indicates something to be studied in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieb’s team emphasise they are not claiming that there is rampant fraud and deliberate misrepresentation. They suspect that “researchers may simply not be seeing the necessity of declaring non-financial interests, or be clear on what this includes”. So it’s incumbent on journals to outline more explicitly what constitutes a conflict of interest, and request and reveal them with more vigilance. Researchers themselves should take to heart the foundation on which the search for truth is built: to let go of your beliefs and be willing to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010606.long&quot;&gt;Conflicts of interest and spin in reviews of psychological therapies: a systematic review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Light-induced structural changes and the site of O=O bond formation in PSII caught by XFEL</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21400</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/73_4_HTihfo/nature21400</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Photosystem II (PSII) is a huge membrane-protein complex consisting of 20 different subunits with a total molecular mass of 350 kDa for a monomer. It catalyses light-driven water oxidation at its catalytic centre, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The structure of PSII has been analysed at 1.9 Å resolution by synchrotron radiation X-rays, which revealed that the OEC is a Mn4CaO5 cluster organized in an asymmetric, ‘distorted-chair’ form. This structure was further analysed with femtosecond X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL), providing the ‘radiation damage-free’ structure. The mechanism of O=O bond formation, however, remains obscure owing to the lack of intermediate-state structures. Here we describe the structural changes in PSII induced by two-flash illumination at room temperature at a resolution of 2.35 Å using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography with an XFEL provided by the SPring-8 ångström compact free-electron laser. An isomorphous difference Fourier map between the two-flash and dark-adapted states revealed two areas of apparent changes: around the QB/non-haem iron and the Mn4CaO5 cluster. The changes around the QB/non-haem iron region reflected the electron and proton transfers induced by the two-flash illumination. In the region around the OEC, a water molecule located 3.5 Å from the Mn4CaO5 cluster disappeared from the map upon two-flash illumination. This reduced the distance between another water molecule and the oxygen atom O4, suggesting that proton transfer also occurred. Importantly, the two-flash-minus-dark isomorphous difference Fourier map showed an apparent positive peak around O5, a unique μ4-oxo-bridge located in the quasi-centre of Mn1 and Mn4 (refs 4,5). This suggests the insertion of a new oxygen atom (O6) close to O5, providing an O=O distance of 1.5 Å between these two oxygen atoms. This provides a mechanism for the O=O bond formation consistent with that proposed previously.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Survival of tissue-resident memory T cells requires exogenous lipid uptake and metabolism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21379</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kIwwIMnAQeg/nature21379</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells persist indefinitely in epithelial barrier tissues and protect the host against pathogens. However, the biological pathways that enable the long-term survival of TRM cells are obscure. Here we show that mouse CD8+ TRM cells generated by viral infection of the skin differentially express high levels of several molecules that mediate lipid uptake and intracellular transport, including fatty-acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). We further show that T-cell-specific deficiency of Fabp4 and Fabp5 (Fabp4/Fabp5) impairs exogenous free fatty acid (FFA) uptake by CD8+ TRM cells and greatly reduces their long-term survival in vivo, while having no effect on the survival of central memory T (TCM) cells in lymph nodes. In vitro, CD8+ TRM cells, but not CD8+ TCM cells, demonstrated increased mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the presence of exogenous FFAs; this increase was not seen in Fabp4/Fabp5 double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells. The persistence of CD8+ TRM cells in the skin was strongly diminished by inhibition of mitochondrial FFA β-oxidation in vivo. Moreover, skin CD8+ TRM cells that lacked Fabp4/Fabp5 were less effective at protecting mice from cutaneous viral infection, and lung Fabp4/Fabp5 double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells generated by skin vaccinia virus (VACV) infection were less effective at protecting mice from a lethal pulmonary challenge with VACV. Consistent with the mouse data, increased FABP4 and FABP5 expression and enhanced extracellular FFA uptake were also demonstrated in human CD8+ TRM cells in normal and psoriatic skin. These results suggest that FABP4 and FABP5 have a critical role in the maintenance, longevity and function of CD8+ TRM cells, and suggest that CD8+ TRM cells use exogenous FFAs and their oxidative metabolism to persist in tissue and to mediate protective immunity.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The week at Retraction Watch featured a retraction of a state senator’s paper, and an editor busted for citation boosting. Here’s what was happening elsewhere: “Predatory journals are not desirable, it goes without saying, but the fact that they come about is a sign of a developing market, and a true market in scientific publishing services […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A peculiar new paper proposes the idea of &quot;connecting two spinal cords as a way of sharing information between two brains&quot;. The author is Portuguese psychiatrist Amílcar Silva-dos-Santos and the paper appears in Frontiers in Psychology.



Frontiers are a publisher with a troubled history of publishing dubious science. But this paper is unusual, even by Frontiers' standards, because it contains virtually no science at all.

In a nutshell, Silva-Dos-Santos suggests that it would be interest</description>

&lt;p&gt;True gender equality may be a work in progress, but since the Women’s Liberation Movement beginning in the 1950s and 60s, there has been a lot of positive change, at least in most industrialised nations: a shift towards women having more control over whether and when to have children, for example, and increased opportunities in education and careers, and less tolerance of sexism (though of course it hasn’t gone away). How might these cultural and social changes have influenced women, in terms of how much they act in stereotypically “feminine” ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10804-016-9243-8/fulltext.html?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by Constance Jones and her colleagues at California State and San Francisco State Universities in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Adult Development&lt;/em&gt; tried to find out by comparing two cohorts of women, one born in the 1920s and the other featuring “Baby Boomers” born in the 1950s. The findings support past work that’s shown how women tend to change through their lives, and they provide evidence for a generation effect: over time, at least in California, women seem to be becoming less stereotypically feminine – that is, less deferential, and more confident and ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19249&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 180 women born in the 1920s took the same California Psychological Inventory five times over as many decades, beginning when they were in their 30s and through into their 80s. The researchers were particularly interested in how they scored on the 32 items of the Inventory that measure femininity defined “as being gentle and warm, but also being dependent, and needing reassurance from others”, and how they scored on the 36 items measuring dominance, defined as “being confident, ambitious, assertive, and enterprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 190 women born in the 1950s (actually daughters of the older participants) answered the same questions about their own femininity and dominance, first in 1980s when they were in their 30s, then twice more in their 40s and 50s/60s (taking us up to 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones and her team found evidence of lifespan changes in both cohorts. Women in both groups tended to become less stereotypically feminine as they got older (with some return to more femininity later in life) and both groups showed signs of greater dominance with increasing age. Statistically speaking, the magnitude of change was modest in effect size. “[The] women appeared to drop constraining negative aspects of the feminine gender role and take on positive cross-gendered qualities with age,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing across the two cohorts, the women born in the second half of the twentieth century scored lower on femininity when they first completed the inventory in their 30s as compared with the femininity scores of the women born in the 1920s when they were the same age (a modest group difference in terms of effect size). “Most likely reacting to the Women’s Movement zeitgeist, [the younger cohort] entered young adulthood with less obligation to take on feminine gender constraints in the first place,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the rate of increase in dominance shown by the second generation women through their lives was more rapid than that shown by their mothers. Because of this difference in speed of change, the researchers said “we can expect the younger cohort women to be higher than the older cohort women in dominance when they reach later adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be fascinating to see if and how these trends have continued in Generation X and Millenials. If you reflect on your own family – for example, how you or your sisters compare in femininity and dominance (as defined in this study) with your mother – bear in mind the implications of the parallel changes in these traits through lives and across generations. A young woman today might not seem a lot more dominant and less feminine than her mother is today, but that might be because of the way her mother has changed through her life. The chances are that the young woman is more dominant and less feminine than her mother was at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has some issues, including a reliance on how participants rated themselves and missing data from some of the survey points, which meant the researchers sometimes had to extrapolate from the scores they did have. Also both cohort samples were fairly small, and perhaps the observed generational changes are unique to the Bay Area of California. That said, Jones and her team pointed out that it was “rare to be able to examine personality change across such as expansive portion of the lifespan (age 20s through the 80s) and to be able to tie two historically important cohorts together.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Lemur fig 5&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-5-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking a face out of a crowd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our closest relatives, primates have long been a focus of research into their behavior and evolution. As many primate species become threatened with extinction, research on wild populations has become even more important, being crucial to conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term studies, following primate social groups over many years, can be especially informative. However, a key requirement for such studies is to consistently and accurately identify different individuals: not always an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional way of identifying individuals is to capture them and attach a tag or collar. This has proven to be an effective technique on a number of successful long-term field studies. However it also comes with drawbacks. Capturing animals can be hard enough with birds or small mammals like rodents; for large primates, it usually involves darting them with a blow-gun or air rifle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is both expensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of individuals that can be tagged. Of even greater concern, the act of capture itself can be harmful to the animals, whether through damage caused during capture (anything from stress to broken bones), or by disrupting group dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to capturing and tagging is to identify individuals via natural variation in their features, such as scars or skin patterns. This does, however, require considerable skill on the part of observers. Even with extensive training, it is still inevitable that errors will occur in identification both within and between observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8581&quot; style=&quot;width: 2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lemur fig 1&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8581 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1442&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1990&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Examples of different lemur species, demonstrating the facial features that can allow individuals to be accurately identified.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;David Crouse, Rachel Jacobs, Stacey Tecot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really needed is a non-invasive identification method that relies less on human perception. The developing field of animal biometrics offers a potential solution, with automated recognition systems showing promise in a number of mammal species. New research, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-016-0011-9&quot;&gt;published today &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt;, describes the development of such an automated facial recognition system for lemurs: LemurFaceID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s that lemur?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the result of collaboration between a number of US-based scientists, led by lemur researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://rachellynjacobs.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stecot.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;Stacy Tecot&lt;/a&gt; and biometrics researchers David Crouse and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cse.msu.edu/~jain/&quot;&gt;Anil Jain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work takes advantage of a well-studied population of red-bellied lemurs. Like all lemurs, the red-bellied lemur is found only on the island of Madagascar. The study population, living in Ranomafana National Park, has been the subject of multiple research projects since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a substantial database of known individuals has been built up, based on variation in facial patterns. However, substantial training is required to identify individuals in this way, which led the researchers to develop this new system that can automatically match a photo of a lemur’s face to a database of known individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8582&quot; style=&quot;width: 1700px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lemur fig 2&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8582 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1129&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-2.png&quot; width=&quot;1690&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red bellied lemurs. The individual on the right is female, on the left a male, with distinctive white patch of skin around the eyes. Facial patterns are individually variable, allowing researchers to identify individuals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;J. Falinomenjanahary&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the researchers had access to 462 images of 80 red-bellied lemur individuals. LemurFaceID requires a researcher to manually locate the eyes in the picture, the critical aspect of this recognition system, as with most human facial recognition systems. Various other alterations are then made to the image (see below for a basic outline of the process) before LemurFaceID automatically compares and matches it to the database of known individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8584&quot; style=&quot;width: 4985px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Flowchart of how LemurFaceID works.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8584&quot; height=&quot;3430&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-6.png&quot; width=&quot;4975&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flowchart of how LemurFaceID works.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Crouse et al. 2017&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that LemurFaceID has a relatively high level of accuracy (98.7%) in ‘closed set’ mode – i.e. when only tested with pictures of known individuals already included in its database. Accuracy was lower in an ‘open-set’ mode when it was tested with pictures of lemurs not already included in the database. This suggests that, for now, LemurFaceID would be most useful for captive or well-studied wild populations (like this one) where all individuals are known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers are confident that the system can be further improved by the addition of larger datasets of photos and individuals, along with further field testing, eventually improving its ability to distinguish between known and novel individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing the potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a non-invasive method to recognise lemurs that does not require extensive training. The potential benefits of such a system are considerable. By reducing the difficulty and cost of long-term monitoring of wild lemur populations, the scope of such studies could be increased with more and better quality data generated in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have considerable benefit for our knowledge of the evolution of this unique primate radiation, endemic to just a single island, and help us learn more about their social systems. It would also enable improved monitoring of lemur population numbers and demographic structures, helping conservationists better model extinction risk; an important consideration when many lemur species (including the red-bellied lemur) are threatened by human encroachments into their habitat. It could even help fight the illegal pet-trade in lemurs taken from the wild, by allowing law enforcement and tourists to rapidly report sightings and determine the origin of captive lemurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8585&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example of processing carried out on lemur images.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8585&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-Fig8.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Example of processing carried out on lemur images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Crouse et al. 2017&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods could also be adapted to other primates or even other large mammal species with variable facial or skin patterns, such as bears, red pandas, or sloths. Already similar automated facial recognition systems have been developed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-5281-2013-49&quot;&gt;chimps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1802/20142284&quot;&gt;guenons&lt;/a&gt;. Such systems could even be combined with automated remote camera traps, increasingly used to monitor populations of hard-to-track wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers’ caution there is no “one size fits all” approach to automated animal facial recognition, it is clearly a technique that will play an ever larger part in our understanding of, and attempts to preserve, the large mammals of our world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>xcorr.net: An introduction to meta-analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://xcorr.net/?p=6788</guid>
	<link>https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading an excellent book on meta-analysis, Introduction to Meta Analysis by Borenstein et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-amazon&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts with the motivating example of streptokinase, a &lt;em&gt;blood clot buster.&lt;/em&gt; Early studies showed conflicting evidence of efficacy of the drug in preventing death following a heart attack. These early studies were small, and the main outcome was often not significantly different from zero; it took very large scale studies in 1986 and 1987 to confirm the protective effect of streptokinase, which could reduce deaths by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-6788&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book makes the convincing case that the protective role of streptokinase could have been confirmed &lt;em&gt;ten years prior&lt;/em&gt; by aggregating the information from early studies. Early results were not truly contradictory; the studies were simply underpowered for the effect of interest – the ratio of the survival rates in the experiment and control arms. As you can see in this forest plot, the error bars in the early studies were huge, and overlapped 0, but many more studies showed a protective effect than not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/hta101/a_images_hta101/04_image01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the effect could have been uncovered earlier is obvious from the plot on the right, which shows a cumulative meta-analysis; what happens when we aggregate all the studies up to a certain study? It’s clear from this result that the evidence was already overwhelming by 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good meta analysis, such as this one, can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aggregate disparate information from different studies in an easily digestable from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get precise estimates of effect sizes, allowing decisions to be centered around whether a treatment shows a &lt;em&gt;clinically&lt;/em&gt; significant effect, as opposed to a simply &lt;em&gt;statistically&lt;/em&gt; significant one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify points of agreement and disagreements between studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify factors that moderate effect size through subgroup analysis and meta-regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;guide the design of follow-up studies – for example, by identifying what is currently unclear in the extant data, or by furnishing an effect size estimate for power analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The mechanics of meta-analysis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a meta-analysis is to estimate an aggregate effect size. Now, different studies differ in substantive details – the target population, the randomization process, the practices of the institutions that perform the study – and so one cannot simply integrate data from different studies &lt;em&gt;as though&lt;/em&gt; they’re coming from the same study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, one assumes that the true underlying effect – on survival, blood pressure, choice probability, etc. – differs from study to study. Even if each study had an infinite number of subjects, there would still be measurable discrepancies between the measured effect sizes between studies. These differences in effect sizes would then reflect substantive differences between the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this &lt;em&gt;random effects&lt;/em&gt; model, bigger studies count more, but smaller studies are still informative about the range of effects that one would measure in real life. The mean effect size is just as interesting as the range of effect sizes. An heterogeneity statistic, $I^2$, can help one judge whether studies generally agree or disagree, and whether this has substantive implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify the source of heterogeneity, one can use subgroup analysis and meta-regression. In subgroup analysis, you slice the data along dimensions of interest, e.g. smokers vs. non-smokers, or different treatment arms. In meta-regression, you instead regress a continuous variable against the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches can be useful in identifying future directions of research, but they must be carefully interpreted, as they are correlational; even if each study was double-blinded, subgroup analysis and meta-regression will break randomization, and should not be interpreted causally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Philosophical issues&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book goes into considerable detail into the manual computation of random effects models using a spreadsheet program, but in all honesty, you’re better off skipping these chapters, going straight into R and &lt;code&gt;install.packages(&quot;meta&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. I’m using this package for an ongoing meta-analysis I’m running; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/phaco-meta&quot;&gt;you can take a peek at what the code looks like here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in the discussion chapters, on philosophical issues and interpretation and &lt;em&gt;gotchas&lt;/em&gt; that the book really shines. One chapter I really liked is on identifying publication bias. Studies can suffer from the &lt;em&gt;file drawer problem&lt;/em&gt;: studies with negative results never get published because of a lack of incentive to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some techniques that have been developed to deal with publication bias. The underlying model is that large studies get published no matter their result, because they require so much resources and collaboration and are guaranteed a publication slot.  However, smaller studies are much more prone to publication bias; who wants to publish a tiny study with negative results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Figure 5: Funnel plot analysis[4]&quot; class=&quot; aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.ijmm.org/articles/2014/32/3/images/IndianJMedMicrobiol_2014_32_3_229_136547_u6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; /&gt;A funnel plot showing no sign of publication bias [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2014;volume=32;issue=3;spage=229;epage=235;aulast=Pabalan&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/figure&gt;The funnel plot is a graphical tool to diagnose the presence of missing studies, which plots effect size on the x axis and study size on the y axis. Large studies are shown at the top, smaller studies at the bottom. Studies should be organized in an orderly funnel – more consistency for larger studies, and less so for the smaller studies. But if smaller studies are missing because of the file drawer problem, the funnel will be &lt;em&gt;asymmetric; &lt;/em&gt;small studies with null results will be missing from the results.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is to sort studies by descending size, and perform a cumulative meta-analysis; what happens if I analyze only the largest study? the two largest studies? the top 3? and so on. Mechanically, it’s the same analysis to the one that was applied to study when streptokinase could have been shown to be efficacious, but sorting by decreasing study size rather than date.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the analysis suffers from publication bias, the effect size estimate should drift as one adds smaller and smaller studies to the meta-analysis. Rather than try and correct for the bias, one can simply highlight the &lt;em&gt;sensitivity&lt;/em&gt; of the analysis to publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend picking up this book as a first-line reference. I just wish it had a better discussion of dealing with missing data. I’m running a meta-analysis on glaucoma treatments with Dr. Masis these days and it seems like every other cell in my worksheet is &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;. That’s unavoidable in a world where multiple researchers do independent studies without consulting each other; they’re going to measure slightly different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with missing data in a principled way, we can use multiple imputation, or go full Bayesian. Each of these is its own large area of research, and I’ll follow up this post with my experiences with this.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Feature weighting as a tool for clustered based imputation model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2017-02-16:/2017/02/16/feature-weighting-as-a-tool-for-clustered-based-imputation-model.html</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Imputation of missing attribute-values is an important data pre-processing
step. Missing of the attribute values are an inevitable problem in real-world
data collection. However, most of the data processing models don’t have any
mechanism to deal with missing values. One of the solutions to this problem is
to have an imputation step added in data pre-processing. Imputation model
relays on the initial prediction of the missing values and has no mechanism to
distinguish the observed and imputed values. But, the imputed values are only
as good as the assumption used to create them. In this research, we introduce
an unsupervised cluster-dependent feature weighing imputation model. This model
uses the feature weighing factor to rescaled the data to nullify the effect of
initial prediction of the missing attribute-values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get a great piece of news, who do you tell? Do you get on the phone to your best friend? Launch the news onto Facebook to sail the sea of Likes? Do you congratulate yourself in front of someone you know doesn’t enjoy the same fortune or ability? Or do you keep it to yourself? Let me share some good news with you: according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/jid/37/4/250/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published recently in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;, your answers to these questions may say something about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19218&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cara Palmer and her colleagues had 251 US undergrads take a personality questionnaire, then asked them to imagine they’d experienced a number positive events like getting a good grade or hosting a great party, and to say how likely it is that they would share this news in one of three ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way was to tell a good friend or family member about the news, to &lt;em&gt;capitalise&lt;/em&gt; on the event, squeezing the juice out of the good experience by revisiting it with an encouraging audience. The women in the sample more often than the men said that they would probably do this. The personality trait Agreeableness, and having more empathy, were also associated with capitalising on good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of sharing that the researchers asked the participants about was whether they would &lt;em&gt;brag &lt;/em&gt;about the event, enhancing their self-image by announcing their achievement to someone liable to be envious, like a classmate who struggled on the exam that they themselves had aced. Bragging is normally considered more prototypically masculine, but overall rates of hypothetical bragging were similar across genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Palmer’s team drilled into the data to find different clusters of responses, and found that only men showed a propensity to fall into a distinct “bragger” group whose other forms of hypothetical news sharing were unremarkable – 30 per cent of men fitted this description versus just five per cent of women. The women braggers, by contrast, tended to be big sharers all round, being more likely than average to say they would share their news in other ways too. Regardless of gender, braggers tended to be less agreeable and conscientious: this is consistent with the idea that to brag you have to be insensitive to the reactions of others and not careful enough to restrict your decisions to avert conflicts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final type of sharing that the researchers asked about was mass-sharing of events on social media. Palmer’s team expected to find gender effects here, as women spend more time on social sites like Facebook than men, and they often cite a major reason for using such sites is to mass-share information, but in this dataset there were no gender differences. In terms of personality, the researchers found that those who said they would mass-share were more likely to score high on narcissism (conversely, those participants who said they were least likely to share in any way tended to be less narcissistic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraversion played a small role in these findings: it was correlated with capitalising but otherwise unrelated to the sharing types or clusters. This is consistent with the familiar experience of being on the receiving end of good news stories from an extravert friend –  studies show they tend to experience more positive events to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing is generally a good thing, especially one-to-one capitalising that allows you to reflect on and process experiences. The positive psychology movement also suggests that acknowledging and noting good experiences is, at least in moderation, beneficial for our psychological health and wellbeing. Bragging, in contrast, can generate resentment and ostracise acquaintances, and is a behaviour better discouraged. This research suggests that male braggers may stand out more obviously, whereas women may brag as part of their share-heavy style where it blends in more – but may be no less corrosive. Next time you want to share something great that’s happened to you, have a think about what you are trying to get out of this – and whether your audience really need to hear it. Don’t let your good news be another’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/jid/37/4/250/&quot;&gt;How do people share their positive events? Individual differences in capitalizing, bragging, and mass-sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
