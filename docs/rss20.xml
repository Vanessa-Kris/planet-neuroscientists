&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidrobson.me/&quot;&gt;David Robson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to consider how old you feel. Not your actual, biological age – but your own subjective feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundant research during the past few decades have shown that this “subjective age” can be a powerful predictor of your health, including the risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/geronb/gby006/4838941?redirectedFrom=PDF&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986588&quot;&gt;diabetes and hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395617310233&quot;&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and hospitalisation for illness and injury, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1803.pdf&quot;&gt;even mortality&lt;/a&gt; – better than your actual age. In each case, the younger you feel, the healthier you are.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link probably goes in both directions. So while it’s true that ill-health may make you feel older, a higher subjective age could also limit your physical activity and increase feelings of vulnerability that make it hard to cope with stress – both of which could, independently, lead to illness. The result could even be a vicious cycle, where feelings of accelerated ageing lead you to become more inactive, and the resulting ill-health then further confirms your pessimistic views. And as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180712-the-age-you-feel-means-more-than-your-actual-birthdate&quot;&gt;I recently wrote for BBC Future&lt;/a&gt;, understanding this process could be essential for designing more effective health programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier has led much of the work examining this phenomenon, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617303598&quot;&gt;his latest paper&lt;/a&gt;, published with colleagues in the journal &lt;i&gt;Intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, extends this understanding by revealing a surprising link with IQ. According to this research, the more intelligent we are in our late teens and early 20s, the younger we will feel in our 70s – and this may also be reflected in various markers of biological ageing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34472&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan’s team’s analysis is based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which for many years has tracked thousands of men and women born between 1937 and 1940. In 1957, each member of the study took an IQ test, which Stephan then compared to their estimated subjective age, taken more than 50 years later in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with other studies, the average participant felt about 17 per cent younger in their 70s than their actual age – but the precise difference depended on their adolescent intelligence (those participants who’d had higher teen IQ felt even younger), a link that remained even when the analysis controlled for the influence of demographic factors.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After establishing this basic correlation, Stephan’s team also looked for other personal characteristics, such as education level and different personality traits, that might mediate the relationship. They found that greater “openness to experience”, which is associated with having&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a higher IQ, seemed to be important. Perhaps a higher IQ, which helps us to process complex information more easily, also increases our curiosity about the world, and it’s that sense of wonder and excitement that can make us feel more youthful.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having higher intelligence might also make it easier to cope with the challenges that come with age, so that we don’t feel so vulnerable to our changing circumstances. And people with higher IQ may also be better able to deconstruct the negative age stereotypes that might otherwise place limits on our behaviour and lead to greater feelings of vulnerability.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study chimes with others that have similarly linked a higher childhood IQ to various signs of biological ageing, including the length of our cells’ telomeres (the protective “caps” on the end of chromosomes that tend to shorten over the lifespan) and epigenetic markers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that lower subjective age appears to encourage healthier behaviours, these new findings could help to explain these earlier IQ-ageing correlations. But once again, we should be wary of oversimplifying these relationships. A higher IQ could easily enhance our health through other pathways, such as the socioeconomic advantage that comes with better education.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan’s paper can’t unpick all these mechanisms, but it could certainly provoke some fascinating future research on the ways our cognitive abilities influence the ageing process.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be particularly interested to see similar studies that look beyond the reasoning found on traditional intelligence tests. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/21/why-some-smart-people-make-foolish-decisions/&quot;&gt;Research Digest explored last year&lt;/a&gt;, our critical thinking skills (such as how well we are able to dispassionately evaluate an argument), are more predictive than our basic IQ of the likelihood we will experience many life events – from the small stresses such as losing your passport to getting divorced, falling into debt, or catching a sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might other measures of “good” thinking, prove to have an even closer link to the measures of subjective and biological ageing? It would be fascinating to see if these skills – which can be taught – could also help people cope with the challenges of old age, by reducing stressful mistakes and encouraging healthier behaviours, and by helping us to question age stereotypes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Stephan’s paper provides one more fascinating example of the far-reaching effects of our thinking and reasoning abilities, far beyond their obvious influence over our academic and professional success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617303598&quot;&gt;Higher IQ in adolescence is related to a younger subjective age in later life: Findings from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say that our close friends have become a part of us, we’re usually talking metaphorically. Yet prior research has shown there is a literal sense in which this is true. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202250220&quot;&gt;we’re slower at judging whether given personality traits apply to us or our friends&lt;/a&gt;, compared with when judging whether traits belong to us or someone we’re not close to – it’s as if our friends’ traits and our own have somehow become shared, which makes the judgment trickier. Similarly, in terms of brain activity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002339&quot;&gt;we respond to mistakes made by friends in a similar way to how we respond to our own mistakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a team led by Sarah Ketay at the University Hartford have shown how this absorption of friends into our self-concept can manifest at a visual level, affecting our ability to distinguish their faces from our own. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518788702&quot;&gt;Writing in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/a&gt;, Ketay’s team said “The present research supports the idea that close others are processed preferentially and may overlap with the self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34451&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial study with 24 female undergrads involved them looking at a series of photos of their own face interspersed with photos of a close female friend’s face: each time a face appeared on-screen they had to press a button as fast as possible to indicate whether it was their face or their friend’s. In another condition, the challenge was similar but this time they had to distinguish between their own face and the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity, such as Reese Witherspoon. All the faces had neutral expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ reaction times were slower in the friend condition than the celebrity condition suggesting they found it more difficult to distinguish their own face from their friend’s face, than from a celebrity’s face. Further analysis confirmed this wasn’t due to any differences in similarity of the friend’s/celebrity’s faces compared with their own, nor due to any lack of familiarity with the celebrity faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study with more female undergrads was similar, but this time the researchers used morphing to blend the participants’ faces either with the faces of a close female friend or with the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity. Again the challenge was to indicate as fast as possible whether the face on-screen was their own or someone else’s. This time the participants were slower to make the self-other judgment when their face was morphed with their friend’s than when it was morphed with a celebrity’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample sizes were small (though the study was not underpowered) and exclusively female, so a replication attempt of these findings would certainly be welcome. However, the results are novel: “No previous studies have considered the possibility that … self-other overlap may extend to facial processing,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002339&quot;&gt;Seeing you in me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518788702&quot;&gt;Preliminary evidence for perceptual overlap between self and close others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our culture we like to speculate about the effects of different parenting styles on children. A lot of this debate is wasted breath. Twin studies – that compare similarities in outcomes between genetically identical and non-identical twins raised by their biological or adopted parents – have already shown us that parental influence is far more modest than we usually assume. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618784890&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; goes further, using the twin approach to reveal how it is mistaken to see the parent-child dynamic as a one-way relationship. “Given the current evidence … it is more accurate to conceptualise parenting as a transactional process in which both parents and children exert simultaneous and continuous influence on each other,” write Mona Ayoub at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34446&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayoub’s team used data from the Texas Twin Project, including parents’ ratings of their parenting style (specifically, their warmth and stress levels in relation to each child), and the children’s ratings of their own personality traits based on a kids’ version of the Big Five personality test. In all there were 497 identical twin pairs in the study, 480 same-sex non-identical twin pairs, and 434 opposite-sex twins, and their average age was 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic underlying the researchers’ approach was that if children affect their parents’ parenting style via their own gene-linked traits, then, on average, the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of identical twins should be more similar than the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of non-identical twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what the researchers found. Twenty-seven per cent of the variance in parents’ levels of warmth, and forty-five per cent of the variance in their parental stress levels, was attributable to genetic influences originating in their children. A significant portion of this genetic influence was related to the children’s personality traits: kids who scored higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness tended to have parents who parented with greater warmth, and kids with lower agreeableness had parents who parented with more stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data back up what many mothers and fathers already know through experience – being a paragon of patient parenting is not much effort when your little darling is an angel, it is much trickier when they are a brat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children’s personality traits explained about half of the association between children’s genes and their parents’ behaviour, suggesting other gene-linked traits in the children also have an influence, such as, the researchers suggested, depression and “externalising behaviours”, which means things like aggression and disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was also able to look for the influence of non-shared environmental factors on the parents’ behaviour and the children’s personality traits – these are environmental (non-gene linked) factors that affect one twin but not the other, contributing to different parenting styles toward each twin in the same family. The data can’t specify what these factors are, but an illness that affects one twin but not the other would be an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though less significant than children’s genetic effects, the researchers found that non-shared environmental factors both increased parents’ stress levels and reduced children’s conscientiousness and emotional stability (it’s not clear if such environmental factors affect parental stress, which then has an adverse effect on their children’s personality, or vice versa, or both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayoub and her colleagues highlighted the practical implications of their findings: “parenting interventions may be more efficacious if both parents and children are treated, such that the intervention is tailored to the unique qualities of both parties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study is that it only provides a snapshot of the dynamics between parents and children. It’s likely that the effect of children’s personalities on their parents’ nurturing style is just one aspect of an unfolding dynamic, as parenting style then feeds back and affects the child (albeit more modestly than we often assume). “Longitudinal designs that assess child personality and parenting throughout development will be useful,” the researchers said, “especially because parenting can take different meanings across different developmental stages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618784890&quot;&gt;Genetic and Environmental Associations Between Child Personality and Parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>In a slightly depressing new paper, two researchers describe how they tried to get access to the data behind 111 of the most cited psychology and psychiatry papers published in the past decade. The researchers, Tom E. Hardwicke and John P. A. Ioannidis of Stanford, wanted to place the data into a 'Data Ark' to ensure its continued preservation for science. Unfortunately, in most cases, the data was not made available.



The paper is called Populating the Data Ark and it's out now in PLoS ON</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Child-Resistant Packaging Service Now on Science Exchange</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1686</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/08/child-resistant-packaging-service-now-on-science-exchange/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the creation of commercial packaging, safety can make or break a brand. Custom child-resistant (CR) packaging is one of the most sought after needs in the chemical and pharma industries. CR packaging is used to reduce the risk of children ingesting hazardous substances.To maintain the branding with added child resistant protection, some products underscore the need for custom packaging solutions. Examples of such products would be laundry detergent pod and recreational cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Developing CR packaging, however, can be an arduous task due to the intricate nature of possible materials used in the manufacturing process. To illustrate, most plastic closures are made of a material called polypropylene that is commonly used in plastic hinges. Due to the molecular structure of polypropylene, it is a very difficult material to prototype. Substitutes for polypropylene have their own set of prototyping challenges. As for other options, creating a closure for polyethylene bags or paperboard boxes is equally complicated. These materials lack rigidity, making mechanical locking systems tricky to develop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another critical barrier holding back CR packaging is its stringent certification requirement. Such products require a testing process that determines if the packaging follows the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) standards. The criteria of the testing process are strict and guarantee that small children, for example, are not able to open the package. The testing process adds at least several weeks to the product timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working with a reputable company that has a track record of developing innovative and certified CR mechanisms using sophisticated materials can give manufacturers a competitive edge, accelerating product development while lowering the risk of disastrous harm to consumers. That’s where Science Exchange provider &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/creative-mechanisms-inc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Creative Mechanism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; comes in. They specialize in the development of innovative mechanical solutions as well as maintaining a high degree of know-how in product prototyping. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/creative-mechanisms-inc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contact the provider to learn more about their groundbreaking CR packaging solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You may think of people with high self-control as having enviable reserves of willpower, but recent findings suggest this isn’t the case. Instead it seems the strong-willed are canny folk, adept at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/23/whether-you-snack-or-not-is-more-about-the-presence-of-temptation-than-your-willpower/&quot;&gt;avoiding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/18/is-willpower-overrated/&quot;&gt;temptation&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2018.1495666&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt; builds on this picture, showing that people high in self-control tend to experience less intense visceral states, like fatigue, hunger and stress (states that are known to encourage impulsive behaviour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings make sense: after all, it is much easier to be in control of your decisions if you are organised enough to ensure your animalistic needs rarely become overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34427&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Baldwin’s team exploited five years’ worth of relevant data from their lab, taking in studies that had measured trait self-control (rated through agreement with statements like “I have hard time breaking bad habits” and “I am able to work effectively toward long-term goals”) and that involved one-shot self-reports of states like hunger, fatigue, daily stress, and symptoms of the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ended up with data from over 5,500 college students, mostly women, collected in 25 studies. In many cases, they also had information on how much sleep the participants had had the previous night and the amount of time since they had last eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were very consistent: higher trait self-control correlated with less intense experience of all the measured visceral states, from hunger to cold symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, amount of sleep the previous night, and time since last eating, partly mediated these associations, suggesting that people with high self-control experience less hunger and less fatigue to some extent because they get more sleep and don’t go so long without eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin and her colleagues said their results “are consistent with prior findings that high trait self-control facilitates structuring one’s life in order to avoid negative consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associations uncovered in this research were modest is size, but they remained statistically significant regardless of the time of day, or the time in the semester, that the participants had reported their states. Also, the researchers pointed out that while modest in size, the effects they observed would quickly accumulate. Take, for example, the correlation between higher self-control and getting more sleep the preceding night: “On any given night we would expect a person low in trait self-control to sleep about 20 minutes less than a person high in trait self-control,” the researchers explained. “Over the span of a week, this adds up to a two-hour difference in sleep duration – an accumulation of sleep debt that may have consequences for health and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the methodology of this research can’t prove that having higher self-control leads to experiencing milder visceral states (via better organized sleep and eating behaviors), the data are certainly consistent with that picture. Longitudinal research that follows people over time will be able to confirm this account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliance on college students is another short-coming. But perhaps more problematic is that these findings still leave open the question of what it is about high self-control individuals that allows them, more than others, to better plan their lives so that they experience less stress and milder visceral states. If it isn’t deep reserves of willpower, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging picture is that high self-control is associated with having a pervasive inclination for orderliness, planning and thinking ahead, which sounds very much like trait conscientiousness (and personality research has shown that high &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180221-the-hidden-side-to-your-personality&quot;&gt;conscientiousness too is associated with living more healthily and experiencing less stress&lt;/a&gt;). So, where then does conscientiousness come from? There is no simple, complete answer as yet, but we do know the trait is partly genetically inherited and that it is fostered through having meaningful social roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2018.1495666&quot;&gt;Higher trait self-control is associated with less intense visceral states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching, it has often been said, is the one profession that creates all other professions. Therefore it is so important that we learn how to do it right. The ways that teachers learn from each other is likely to be an important part of this, especially how they discern each other’s expertise and whether&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;they are inclined to seek advice and help from the most able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by James Spillane at Northwestern University has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373718785764?journalCode=epaa&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis&lt;/i&gt; that looks into these teacher behaviours. The researchers employed a mixed-method approach that spanned five years and involved staff from fourteen different primary schools in the US. This included surveys and interviews to explore how maths teachers conceptualised expert teaching, and then an analysis of student test scores along with teachers’ self-reported interactions with their colleagues, to assess if expert teachers behave differently from their peers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34401&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the study focused on finding out what information teachers draw on to form their opinion of which of their colleagues is an expert. With schools nowadays awash with data to track student progress, one obvious way to assess which teachers are most expert is to compare their class test scores. However, results from this study suggest that those at the chalkface tend not to use this metric.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 90 per cent of staff referred to something other than student test scores, with common answers including their colleagues’ “instructional practice”, which incorporated: how their peers questioned students; the organisation and flow of their lessons; and their ability to generate student engagement, enthusiasm and excitement for the subject. Other factors included: their peers’ “knowledge and enthusiasm for teaching their subject”, which also included the ability to explain their subject to their peers; as well as their “formal position and formal training”,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;which covered their role in the school and which professional development they had previously undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the majority of teachers not use student test scores as a key factor when weighing up teaching expertise? The researchers suggested that “teachers do not trust student test scores as valid measures of teacher performance in general” or, if they do, that “student test scores may not be easily remembered or accessed as teachers make decisions about whom to seek for advice, especially if such decisions are made quickly during the work day”. Essentially, weighing up teaching expertise was seen as something that you can sense, as opposed to being measurable by objective numerical data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the study looked at which teachers were most likely to give or seek advice from their colleagues. The researchers found that the best teachers, as measured by those who had a higher percentage of students who met the minimum requirement to pass their class, and whose classes had higher than average test scores, were no more likely to be sought out by their colleagues for their advice. On the other hand, these expert teachers were the ones who were actually more likely to seek advice from their peers the following year. It seems that the better the teacher performed, the more likely they were to go out and obtain feedback on how to be even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding that the most able are not particularly sought after for their advice and are instead more likely to seek it from others is perhaps unsurprising. Other research, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/studies/18-the-one-about-the-dunning-kruger-effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;, has found that the least able tend to have an inflated view of their abilities, which would presumably lead to them seeking out less feedback. After all, why would one seek out advice if they think there is little room for development? As for the expert teachers in this study, the researchers speculate that their advice-seeking tendencies may be explained as “they represent a group of teachers who are constantly striving to improve by seeking out advice and information from others”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the teachers studied in this research were from primary schools, which typically put less emphasis on test results. Likewise, they were selected from a school district in America that did not have a large emphasis on teacher accountability for student test results. It is possible that in other circumstances teachers may measure expertise differently, and be more likely to seek out those whose students consistently got the best test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, this study does have some interesting potential implications for educators. First, any policy makers relying solely on student test scores to measure teacher effectiveness may be met with scepticism amongst school staff. Second, and perhaps most importantly, schools should actively encourage their staff to view asking for help and advice as a sign of strength and not of weakness. This would result in schools utilising their expert teachers more effectively, which would likely boost staff morale, abilities and test scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admitting mistakes, seeking help, apologising first, confessing one’s romantic feelings – all these kind of situations involve intentional expressions of vulnerability, in which we may fear being rejected or being judged negatively, yet we grit our teeth and go ahead anyway. According to a team of psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-34832-002&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contrary to our worst fears, having the courage to show our vulnerability in these ways will often be rewarded. That’s because there is an intriguing mismatch in the way we take a more negative view of our own vulnerability than we do of other people’s – the researchers call this “the beautiful mess effect”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34404&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Bruk and her colleagues at the University of Mannheim were inspired in part by Brené Brown’s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/0241257409/&quot;&gt;Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in which she argues, based on interviews she’s conducted and other qualitative evidence, that “we love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we are afraid to let them see it in us … Vulnerability is courage in you and inadequacy in me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find some experimental evidence to back up this idea, and to test a possible explanation, Bruk and her team conducted seven studies with hundreds of participants. The format for many was that the participants were asked to imagine scenarios in which either they or another person displayed intentional vulnerability – such as confessing romantic love or admitting to a mistake – and then they either rated their own vulnerability (e.g. how strongly they agreed they had shown courage or weakness), or the other person’s vulnerability, respectively.  Time and again, and across many different contexts, participants perceived their own vulnerability more negatively and less positively than other people’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, asking people to imagine hypothetical scenarios is always going to lack realism. For another study, the researchers contrived matters so that participants either expected to display vulnerability themselves in a real-life situation (improvising a song in front of a jury) or they expected someone else to display that vulnerability in front of them (that is, the participant would be a member of the jury). In fact, the performance didn’t go ahead, but participants agreed it was an act of vulnerability and either rated themselves (if they were to be the singer) or they rated the other person – again, participants rated other people’s vulnerability much more positively than they rated their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruk and her team think that a key mechanism explaining this contrast in perspectives is to do with the “construal level” – they found evidence that when we think about our own vulnerability we do so very concretely (i.e. with a low construal level) whereas when we think about others’ vulnerability we do so more abstractly (i.e. with a high construal level).  Previous research on so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory&quot;&gt;construal level theory&lt;/a&gt;” has already shown that a higher, more abstract construal level is associated with a more positive, risk-friendly perspective, so it follows that viewing the vulnerability of others with this mindset would lead to more positive impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue their findings are important given earlier research showing the benefits of expressing vulnerability: self-disclosure can build trust, seeking help can boost learning, admitting mistakes can foster forgiveness, and confessing one’s romantic feelings can lead to new relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even when examples of showing vulnerability might sometimes feel more like weakness from the inside, our findings indicate, that, to others, these acts might look more like courage from the outside,” Bruk and her colleagues concluded. “Given the discussed positive consequences of showing vulnerability for the relationship quality, health, or job performance, it might, indeed, be beneficial to try to overcome one’s fears and to choose to see the beauty in the mess of vulnerable situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4916-2&quot;&gt;Genomic make-up of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent trend in domestication is a selection of traits that closely relate to an animal’s wild ancestors.  The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog (CWD), a cross between the Carpathian wolf and the German Shepard, is an example of this type of selective breeding.  A study by Caniglia et al. published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;performed a genome-wide analysis of CWD to compare its genome with the parental population (Carpathian wolves and German Shepherds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genome-wide analysis of 170k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms was performed in 12 unrelated CWD and 12 unrelated Carpathian wolves.  Genotypes from these individuals were then compared to each other as well as genotypes of 355 dogs from 30 breeds. CWD genomes were distinct from Carpathian wolves and German Shepherds, but there were also genetic similarities.  Within the CWD genome over 300 genes were more associated with wolf ancestry and over than 2000 genes were more associated with dog ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, specific gene analysis found that the genes associated with wolf ancestry related to morphological phenotypes such as a narrow face, short ears, and a pointed chin while the dog-related genes were associated with communication and behavior such as brain development, sociality and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent meta-analysis by Laws et al. published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;sought to determine the effectiveness of CBTp on functioning, distress, and quality of life in people with schizophrenia.  A total of 37 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBTp showed mild effectiveness for functioning in people with schizophrenia, but this effect was not long lasting.  No significant benefit of CBTp was found for distress or quality of life. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CBTp may not be an effective treatment for non-symptomatic outcomes in people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 12,372 14-17-year olds from Germany, Greece, Iceland, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain answered questionnaires related to socio-demographic variables and cyberbullying.  Approximately 22% of adolescents experienced cyberbullying with the highest rates in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest rates in Spain (13.3%).  Cyberbullying was also associated with higher rates of internalizing problems, which include social withdrawal and anxiety, as well as externalizing problems, such as aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parasites can greatly impact the health of animals, and factors such as temperature, group size, and diet can influence parasite infection.  A study by Hokan et al. published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; examined how sleeping site impacts parasite infection by comparing two nocturnal lemurs: the Milne-Edwards sportive lemur and the Western woolly lemur. Since both of these species have similar diets, live in the same habitat, are of similar size, and live in pairs, the authors were able to specifically analyze the effect of sleeping site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sleeping sites of twenty-six sportive lemurs and 22 woolly lemurs were recorded and feces was collected to analyze infection intensity and parasite species.  Researchers found that sportive lemur sleep sites exclusively sleep in tree holes and will use the same sites repeatedly. In contrast woolly lemurs sleep on branches and vary their sleeping sites. Fecal analysis found that the probability of sportive lemurs shedding parasite eggs was three times higher than woolly lemurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that repeated use of tree holes as a sleeping site can increase parasite exposure and infection.&lt;/p&gt;

The internal suicide debate hypothesis assumes that upon a suicidal crisis, individuals weigh reasons for living (e.g. family) versus reasons for dying (e.g. hopelessness) in their decision to commit suicide. A recent study by Brüdern et al. published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; studied reasons for living (RFL) and reasons for dying (RFD) in predicting future depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in suicide attempters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty suicide attempters admitted to the emergency department were provided questionnaires to measure depression, suicidal ideation, RFL, and RFD. The number of RFL did not predict future depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, but more RFD at initial admission predicted greater levels of depression and suicidal ideation for up to 2 years as well as another suicide attempt 1 year after initial assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Evelyne Decullier &amp;amp; Hervé Maisonneuve have been studying retractions for a long time. They’ve looked at how long retractions take to show up in PubMed, and five years ago they published a paper on the quality of retraction notices — and how well they were disseminated — in 2008. Now, they’ve repeated that analysis for … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/01/have-retraction-notices-improved-over-time/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Have retraction notices improved over time?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: “Synthesizing excitement: a new way your brain makes glutamate” by Samuel Rose</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19625</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/43hzgWWQpX8/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/08/sun-image-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30507-5&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; details a new way that the brain synthesizes glutamate, originating from sun exposure, no less. The research raises the question, &lt;em&gt;do we really know how the brain makes one of its most important neurotransmitters&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do so few non-neuroscientists know what glutamate is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found myself among non-neuroscientist friends discussing MSG. In case you’re unfamiliar, MSG is a delicious food additive that was commonly used in Chinese-American restaurants until regulators became concerned that the ingredient caused symptoms like nausea, headaches, and flushing when overconsumed. The evidence linking MSG to these symptoms is weak and a double-blind placebo-controlled study found no evidence for the so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I chimed in that the logic behind MSG syndrome didn’t even make sense to me since MSG is just glutamate salt. I said “&lt;em&gt;your body knows how to regulate glutamate since it’s probably the most important neurotransmitter in your brain&lt;/em&gt;”. I was met with blank stares. That’s when I realized that glutamate doesn’t have a particularly good publicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair to glutamate’s hypothetical marketing team, the job of selling glutamate to the public hasn’t always been easy. First, glutamate wasn’t truly established as a neurotransmitter until the 1980s, decades after more widely known neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin. Indeed, the 1950s, 60s, and 70s were a period of neurotransmitter mania. Dopamine loss was shown to cause Parkinson’s disease. The original antidepressant medications were shown to alter brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels. A link between schizophrenia and dopamine was established. This era culminated in the concept of neurochemical imbalances, the idea that psychiatric illnesses are caused by improper neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Consequently, neurotransmitters got tidy functional descriptions like “dopamine is rewarding” that were cemented into the popular imagination of the brain. Glutamate, partly because it missed this era, but also because it’s too ubiquitous to all brain functions, has never been pinned with a  neat functional description that the public could easily digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nobel prizes were handed out for work on norepinephrine and dopamine, neuroscientists debated if glutamate even served a specialized function in the brain, at all. Glutamate was already known as an essential amino acid, a building block of proteins. Glutamate was also known to be a component of the Krebs cycle, the sequence of reactions responsible for producing cellular energy in the form of ATP. So every cell in our body, not just neurons, has a lot of glutamate floating around, participating in many non-neurotransmission things. You could say that glutamate was hiding in plain sight from mid-century neuroscientists. It was abundant, ubiquitous, and busy serving other functions. No single experiment proved that glutamate was a transmitter. It took decades of incremental progress to establish glutamate’s neurotransmitter bona fides. Drugs that looked a lot like glutamate seemed to have profound effects on neurons in a dish. Different types of glutamate receptors were discovered and their contributions to neuronal function were delineated through incremental progress.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; By the 1980s, overwhelming experimental evidence pointed to glutamate as not only a true neurotransmitter, but the brain’s most common messenger in neuron-to-neuron communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19626&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/08/Sam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19626&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/08/Sam-300x226.jpg&quot; width=&quot;419&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pubmed search results for “glutamate neurotransmitter” vs. “serotonin neurotransmitter” or “dopamine neurotransmitter”, by year. Despite being the brain’s principle excitatory transmitter, research into glutamate neurotransmission didn’t gain traction until the 1980s, well after dopamine and serotonin.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the things that happen within the few nanometers of a glutamatergic synapse are the obsession of whole fields of neuroscience. That being said, glutamate, itself, is rarely placed at the center of the narrative.  In contrast to the 50s-70s, today’s neuroscience casts circuits (ensembles of connected neurons), rather than transmitters, as the central characters in the brain. Today we are told that circuits are the conduit for how we learn, think, and feel. Even though most of these circuits require glutamate neurotransmission, glutamate itself is not the star of the show. Instead, it’s cast as a small piece of the bigger puzzle that is the neural circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we really know how glutamate is made?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question often asked about neurotransmitters is, how do they get made? In the 50s-70s, neurotransmitter origin stories were the intensely studied. Biochemical maps of dopamine and serotonin synthesis were drawn into text books and are still a popular quiz subject in introductory neuroscience courses. How your brain’s glutamate gets made, though, has never quite had a satisfying answer. The most recognized mechanism for brain glutamate synthesis is actually not synthesis at all but recycling. Specialized brain cells called astrocytes take a breakdown product of glutamate, glutamine, and reconvert it to glutamate before shuttling it back to neurons. So glutamate comes from old glutamate, which begs the question where does the original glutamate come from? To this question, the answer seems to be a shrug. Perhaps it comes from the Krebs cycle or from broken down proteins or from diet. A study published in the May issue of &lt;em&gt;Cell &lt;/em&gt;introduces a new idea, what if it comes from the sun?&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors from The University of Science and Technology of China used a novel, sensitive way to measure chemicals within single neurons. With this technique, the authors found a handful of chemicals that have never been measured before in neurons, one of which is something called urocanic acid. Though no one’s seen it in the brain before now, urocanic acid has an interesting role in the skin, where it is thought to act like a natural sunscreen by absorbing UV rays. In fact, urocanic acid levels in the skin actually increase with prolonged sun exposure. So, the authors wondered if brain urocanic acid has anything to do with this skin urocanic acid system. They exposed mice (after a quick buzz cut) to UV-B rays, a type of UV ray emitted by the sun. Surprisingly, urocanic acid increased &lt;em&gt;inside neurons&lt;/em&gt; after a few hours of UV-B exposure to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, exposure to UV-B elevates urocanic acid in the skin and bloodstream, which gets into your brain and elevates the levels of urocanic acid inside neurons. What does this have to do with glutamate? In the liver, there’s an enzyme that can convert urocanic acid to glutamate. Up until now, no one really considered whether this enzyme is in the brain and active. The authors probed for it, found it, and showed that this enzyme is responsive to changes in urocanic acid. So along with increasing urocanic acid, UV-B exposure actually increases glutamate levels nearly &lt;em&gt;3-fold&lt;/em&gt; (!) inside neurons. The last real question the authors had to answer is whether or not this increase in glutamate affects brain functions. The authors presented two pieces of evidence suggesting that it does. First, they saw stronger, more robust, synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with learning and memory, in mice exposed to UV-B. Last, they assessed two different learning paradigms in live mice, following UV-B exposure. They showed that mice exposed to UV-B were better at both motor learning (behaviors like balance and coordination) and recognition memory (behaviors like learning and recalling new objects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again, so how does the brain make glutamate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, utilizing a new way to detect trace chemicals within neurons, stumbled into a novel way the mammalian brain makes one of its most important transmitters. Since mice are nocturnal, it’s a bit peculiar that UV-B rays produce such profound, glutamate-elevating effects. We don’t really know if humans get a sun-triggered boost in glutamate to the same degree as the mice in these experiments, who are experiencing UV-B rays for the first time. Though another question that one might propose is whether diurnal mammals, because they’re outside during daylight, produce more neuronal glutamate than nocturnal mammals like mice. One can’t help but think about the evolutionary trade-off between the safety of a nocturnal lifestyle and the boost in brain capacity provided by sun exposure. Perhaps nocturnal mammals like mice get by on subsistence levels of glutamate, derived from the Krebs cycle. Sun exposure, on the other hand, unlocks a potent driver of glutamate synthesis, boosting, perhaps even tripling, glutamate levels and neuronal signaling capacity in diurnal mammals like us. While these are merely suggestions at this point, it’s intriguing to think that such fundamental aspects of glutamate neurotransmission are still unknown. That should be expected, though, since glutamate – despite being one of the single most important chemicals in the brain – has never really been cast in a dynamic role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10420&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dr. Gongping Liu&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10420&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/GongPing-Liu-250x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Gongping Liu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is now open to submissions. Can you speak about the reason for an open access journal in chemical engineering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical engineering is a field that combines engineering concepts with core scientific principles to develop real world solutions to the benefit of humanity. For example, research into desalination and water purification membranes is of vital importance for the future of a sustainable water supply across the planet. Improving the processing of cheap and efficient materials for affordable solar cells could be the solution to our future energy crisis. Chemical engineering is becoming a focus of scientists and engineers worldwide. BMC has launched the new open access journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; to make the latest developments in the field available to more researchers, particularly those who do not have access to paid databases currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As one of the journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s Section Editors, what is your vision for the journal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to grow &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; into a chemical engineering journal with global impact and internationally renowned in the next three to five years. We hope to devote our efforts to make &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; one of the top chemical engineering journals in the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which types of articles are suitable for submission to &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; has a broad scope; it welcomes papers in basic research and applied research in chemical engineering, such as reaction engineering, separation and purification processes, transport phenomena, process design, sustainable chemical and biochemical processes. Please refer to our detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines&quot;&gt;submission guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, for more instructions on how to prepare your submission, including style and formatting rules for all article types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very promising chemical engineering journal, on which I aspire to publish my own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I determine if my article is a good fit for &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you read through the scope of &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering &lt;/em&gt;which is divided into the following 6 sections: process design, optimization and intensification; reaction engineering and catalysis; transport phenomena; separation and purification processes; plant design, management and control; sustainable chemical and biochemical processes.  Also, you can browse the papers that have been published in this journal. We also have experienced editors and peer reviewers who will ascertain what should be published in the journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared with other journals in the field, what are the differences in positioning of &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMC is a pioneer of open access publishing. In line with the BMC Series ethos, all content in the journal will be open access. We encourage authors to make data associated with their manuscripts accessible online. At the same time, this journal will have an expedited review process, which will enable the latest cutting-edge research to publish as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe what &lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; means to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very promising chemical engineering journal, in which I aspire to publish my own research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, this is the first time I am acting as Section Editor of an international research journal. I hope to contribute my best to its growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gongping Liu &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gongping Liu received his Bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering at Nanjing University of Technology and went on to complete his PhD there in 2013 on mixed-matrix membranes and vapor separation. Following completion of his PhD, Dr. Liu joined Nanjing Tech University as a lecturer, and undertook a post-doctoral position at Georgia Tech working on hollow fiber membranes and gas separation during 2015-2017. He then took up an Associate Professor position at Nanjing University of Technology where his current research interests lie in the area of two-dimensional-materials membranes and mixed-matrix membranes for molecular separations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Liu has published over 60 papers in Nature Materials, Angewandte Chemie, ACS Nano, Advanced Functional Materials, Chemical Society Reviews, Journal of Membrane Science and AIChE Journal with over 2500 citations. He has received the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) Young Membrane Scientist Award in 2018 and the International Forum on Advanced Materials Young Scientist Award in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that we prefer desirable objects – and people – that are physically closer to us has been around for decades. All other things being equal, a potentially dangerous animal that’s close is known to seem scarier than one that’s further away, and it’s been suggested that, in a mirror effect, a nearby desirable person or object is more enticing or attractive than the same one positioned at some distance.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But although this propinquity effect “continues to be a popular topic in introductory social psychology courses, there are surprisingly few works that offer compelling experimental evidence that distance itself influences affective reaction to an object,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218784903&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;i&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/i&gt;, that plugs that gap. Their main finding: men tend to prefer women who are physically closer to them.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34398&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from South Korea and Singapore, and led by Ji-eun Shin, ran a series of studies to investigate, focusing their attention mostly on male judgements of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one, a group of male participants read lines from a modern musical version of Romeo and Juliet with an unfamiliar woman (actually a confederate helping the researchers) who was sitting either 80 centimetres or 150 centimetres away. Overall, those in the close condition reported afterwards that they liked the woman more. A deeper analysis of the data showed that this held only for men who were single, not for those in romantic relationships.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, images of just the faces of eight women, who were matched for physical attractiveness, were presented in pairs, separately to each eye, of another group of male and female participants, with one face appearing to be slightly closer than the other. Both men and women reported liking the faces that appeared closer, and this effect was stronger for men who reported being less satisfied with their current social relationships.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate study, single men watched a video clip of a woman (rated earlier by others as being “mildly attractive”) who stood either 60 cm or 150 cm away from the camera, and who gazed directly into the lens. Again, the participants reported liking the woman more when she was closer, and they estimated that they’d have greater success in asking her out on a date – in other words, she seemed more accessible. This effect was greater for men who’d scored higher on a questionnaire measuring their feelings of loneliness. (The researchers don’t mention the sexual orientation of these volunteers; it seems to be assumed that they were heterosexual.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results support the general idea that proximity amplifies liking. And the researchers also present preliminary data suggesting that people like other desirable objects – including hamburgers and wrapped presents – more when they are physically closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closer hamburger might seem more appealing because it would require less physical effort to acquire than a hamburger that’s further away. But when it comes to interactions with other people, there’s clearly more going on.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, while strangers on public transport generally try to sit as far away from each other as they can, lovers “sit tight”. If someone is standing close to you at a party or in a bar, this may signal that they’re keen to interact – either to chat as a potential friend, or as a potential sexual partner. Especially for a lonely, single person, someone who seems to be sending this&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“accessibility” signal may then appear more desirable than someone who’s positioned at the other side of the room. “From an actor’s standpoint, it would require less psychological and physical effort to befriend a person who seems more approachable and socially receptive (conveyed by proximity),” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused mainly on male attitudes towards women, because, they argue, men are less choosy about who they consider desirable for sex, and more likely to interpret a woman who is standing near to them as showing signs of sexual interest – so they felt a proximity effect was more likely to be apparent for men.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new evidence for the “propinquity effect” is welcome, but mysteries remain about why it occurs and clearly more studies are needed on how it affects women’s feelings, and testing how&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;it plays out in other cultures.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And in fact, publishers had begun to take advantage of the new digital network a decade before open access became a thing. Elsevier, for instance, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/sciencedirect.htm&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt; its online database of electronic journals ScienceDirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; eight years prior to BOAI. But publishers had assumed they would simply port the traditional subscription model to the online environment and carry on much as before, all be it a subscription model re-imagined as the now infamous &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep11/The-Big-Deal-Not-Price-But-Cost.shtml&quot;&gt;Big Deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, as the name suggests, what was radical about the BOAI was not its recognition that journals could now be put online, but the assumption that this could be done without the imposition of paywalls. In retrospect, we can see that this simple idea has ended up calling into question practically every aspect of traditional scholarly publishing, not excluding traditional peer review and the need for legacy publishers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Yet …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet for all its revolutionary potential, and the significant mindshare that open access has acquired over the past 16 years, some of the key &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read&quot;&gt;aspirations articulated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by BOAI have yet to be realised. And they may never be. Yes, today more research is freely accessible. But leaving aside the fact that the openness of that content &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/uaw27/&quot;&gt;is fragile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the truly revolutionary potential of making it open has not yet been exploited. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, for instance, OA has yet to solve &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144706/&quot;&gt;the affordability problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that BOAI promised it would, and in pursuit of which goal most librarians joined the OA movement in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More importantly, OA has failed to create the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisaged by BOAI. Let’s recall: the promise was that removing access barriers would allow the world to “accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich … and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reality today, however, is that paywalls are simply being replaced by publication walls, a development that threatens to disenfranchise those in the global South even more thoroughly than paywalls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These failings are a product of the fact that the strategies adopted and promoted by OA advocates have too often had unintended consequences. Above all, they advocated for the use of pay-to-publish gold OA. In doing so they enabled legacy publishers to co-opt open access, and so lock themselves and their high profits into the new environment, not least by introducing overpriced &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal&quot;&gt;hybrid OA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pay-to-publish model also gave rise to a plague of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open-access_publishing&quot;&gt;predatory publishers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the accompanying tide of fake science now threatens to &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/07/new-international-investigation-tackles-fake-science-and-its-poisonous-effects/&quot;&gt;corrupt the scientific record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nub of the problem is that OA advocates too often fail to think through their ideas and strategies, with the result that their interventions often worsen rather than improve the situation. It does not help that they are susceptible to groupthink and tend to flock around any idea that has superficial appeal. The way that dissident voices are challenged and policed on Twitter is indicative of this tendency. Moreover, OA advocates will often cling to a faulty idea long after it has become clear that it is flawed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And while there were plenty of warnings about likely unintended consequences, these were ignored or poo-pooed. In 2004, for instance, the world’s largest and most experienced publisher Elsevier &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-submits-evidence-on-scientific-publishing-to-committee-of-uk-mps&quot;&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: “By introducing an author-pays model, Open Access risks undermining public trust in the integrity and quality of scientific publications that has been established over hundreds of years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsevier added, “Because the number of articles published will drive revenues, Open Access publishers will continually be under pressure to increase output, potentially at the expense of quality.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsevier is of course not a disinterested party. Nevertheless, its point was a valid one and should have been listened to since it is also an obvious one. (Ironically, as soon as it realised that gold OA would allow it to increase its profits Elsevier quickly distanced itself from its warnings, thus proving the point it had made!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the most knowledgeable and far-sighted commentator has been publishing consultant &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/author/jesposito/&quot;&gt;Joseph Esposito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. True, Esposito is not a disinterested party either, and he has a habit whenever a change to the &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt; is mooted of muttering darkly “be careful what you wish for” (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://liblicense.crl.edu/ListArchives/0610/msg00029.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JosephJEsposito/status/1020025202607120384?s=19&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/02/24/inadvertent-innovation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Nevertheless, his warnings have generally been on the money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2004, for instance, Esposito &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1163/1083&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that in an OA environment, “the overall cost of research publications will rise, though the costs will be borne by different players, primarily authors and their proxies.” This has proved accurate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the same vein, in 2014 Esposito predicted that open access would be additive rather than substitutive, and so further increase the costs of scholarly communication. As he put it, “revenue from OA will be additive to the revenue from traditional journals.”  That is today’s reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in 2105 Esposito &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/14/return-of-the-big-brands/&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that open access would be co-opted by legacy publishers. Few would now deny that that too is today’s reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For open access advocates, this is all hugely frustrating and the cause of a lot of hand-wringing. The uncomfortable truth is that almost every initiative, idea or proposal introduced by the OA movement is rapidly derailed, subverted, or co-opted by publishers for their own benefit, or leads to undesirable developments like predatory publishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Too gloomy a view?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But is this to take too gloomy a view? While many of Esposito’s predictions may be today’s reality, it does not mean that they will be tomorrow’s. After all, we are in the middle of a revolution, and perforce seeing through a glass darkly. We may simply be witnessing the inevitable teething problems that any largescale social change can expect to experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To put my cards on the table: I am a sceptic by nature and so Esposito’s views resonate more with me than the perpetual Pollyannaism of many OA advocates. Nevertheless, I can see that it may just be that the research community is going to have to wade through a lot more mud before it reaches the promised land. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I assume, however, that whether the vision of BOAI is ever fully realised will to a great extent depend on whether those who support, promote and implement open access learn from experience and adapt and change their strategies as a result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here there are encouraging signs. Conscious that the institutional repository movement &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/09/q-with-cnis-clifford-lynch-time-to-re_22.html&quot;&gt;has failed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, for instance, the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coar-repositories.org/&quot;&gt;Confederation of Open Access Repositories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has developed a new strategy focused on creating what it calls a “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/advocacy-leadership/open-science-and-sustainable-development/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Knowledge Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;New determination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More interestingly, in Europe we are seeing a new determination to insist that publishers start offering big deals that include a clear transition path to an all-OA environment. These deals, those pushing for them assert, must be fairly priced and they must consist of a package that includes both access to existing paywalled content &lt;i&gt;plus&lt;/i&gt; the ability for researchers to publish papers OA on a constantly increasing basis. The Association of Universities in the Netherlands (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB&quot;&gt;VSNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;), for instance, has been flexing its consortial muscle to that end and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2018/3/79107/no-new-agreement-with-royal-society-of-chemistry-and-a-new-agreement-with-springer&quot;&gt;turning down deals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; it does not feel meet its requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile in Germany, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/&quot;&gt;Project Deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; is insisting on what it calls “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/bold-open-access-push-germany-could-change-future-academic-publishing&quot;&gt;Publish and Read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;” contracts that make even greater demands of publishers. This has led to a long-standing faceoff between Elsevier and the German research community. And after Sweden followed Germany’s lead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; earlier this year Elsevier &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05754-1&quot;&gt;cut off access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to its electronic journals in both countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What has focused European minds is a fast-approaching deadline. In 2016, the EC made &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/28/eu-ministers-2020-target-free-access-scientific-papers&quot;&gt;a rash promise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that by 2020 all European publicly-funded research would be freely available. Two years out, it has become apparent that Europe will need to take dramatic action if it wants to fulfil its promise – or pay legacy publishers ever larger wads of public money in order to do so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One response has been the EC’s announcement that it plans to &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=3418&quot;&gt;build its own publishing platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More significantly, hard hitter &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/team/robert-jan-smits_e&quot;&gt;Robert-Jan Smits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (“&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing&quot;&gt;one of Europe’s most powerful figures in research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”) has been appointed Senior Advisor on Open Access within the European Political Strategy Centre at the European Commission. His task is to ensure that the 2020 goal is met.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To that end, Smits is currently working on what has been dubbed &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/making-open-access-a-reality-by-2020&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Strikingly, the signals are that Plan S could see legacy publishers excluded from the solution proposed, or assigned a significantly curtailed role. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A similar message is coming from Project Deal. In May, for instance, Gerard Meijer, director of the German Fritz-Haber Institute and member of Project Deal &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceguide.nl/2018/05/open-access-negotiators-prepare-for-a-future-without-publishers/&quot;&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that academic publishers may not be included in its future plans. This may be necessary, he said, because “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;If we keep moving at this pace, we’ll never reach our goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of this may be little more than sabre rattling (we don’t know), but we can surely expect it to focus minds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One problem with Europe’s more aggressive stance is that it is seeing it double down on an anti-democratic and authoritarian trend already evident in its push for OA. We have seen, for instance, ever more demanding and oppressive OA mandates imposed on European researchers – a development at its most extreme in the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/02/open-access-and-research-excellence.html&quot;&gt;OA policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced in 2014 by the (former) Higher Education Funding Council for England (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;HEFCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are now also noises being made to the effect that European researchers may have to give up publishing with legacy publishers and begin using “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05191-0&quot;&gt;alternative platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” (presumably platforms like the one planned by the EC). And it has been suggested that researchers who do not make their work OA could be &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing&quot;&gt;fined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As such, Plan S could end up alienating not just publishers, but the people who actually produce the research in question, even as they are told that they will be the main beneficiaries of open access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Librarians could also find themselves being sidelined. Smits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;suggested, for instance, that librarians are acting as a brake on progress. As he &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/open-access-scientific-publications-must-become-reality-2020-robert-jan-smits_en.html&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, “They want to preserve the money and power they have to finance the subscriptions to the prestigious journals. They fear that if they don’t have this money anymore, their role will be less important.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since they pride themselves on being the premier OA advocates and leaders of the movement this will feel like a punch in the face for librarians. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, the increasingly robust stance Europe is taking in its war with publishers &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; speed up the transition to OA. But there must be concern that it will cause collateral damage, with researchers and librarians the most likely potential victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Back in the USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What we learn from this is that the most high-profile OA activity today is taking place in Europe. But what about the country that gave us the ground-breaking 2004 &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm&quot;&gt;NIH Public Access Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the 2008 &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/&quot;&gt;Harvard OA policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;? What is the state of play in the US today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, we can see new OA policies regularly rolled out, and these are invariably Harvard-style policies.&lt;a name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (The Harvard policy model, we could note, is unlike the top-down compulsory ones being imposed on researchers in Europe. Rather, it involves faculty voluntarily agreeing to adopt policies that invariably include a no-questions-asked waiver element).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can also see a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crossref.org/blog/preprints-growth-rate-ten-times-higher-than-journal-articles/&quot;&gt;re-invigorated preprint movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gathering pace in the US, in part as a result of the advocacy and technology of the Virginia-based &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science&quot;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, but also, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/preprints/&quot;&gt;PeerJ Preprints&lt;/a&gt; etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, the long-standing attempts to have OA legislation like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act&quot;&gt;FASTR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act&quot;&gt;FRPAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; enacted continue. (With little success to date). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What we are not seeing in the US, however, is the same determination to take on publishers. This is doubtless in part because academic culture is different in the US, but also because it would be difficult to organise. As Roger Schonfeld has &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/06/18/will-european-contagion-spread&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the US university system is not centralised in the way it tends to be in Europe. As such, he says, there is “no national-level common negotiating posture” for dealing with publishers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, there is clearly the same desire to move forward with open access, if by different means. And it would seem that the University of California (UC) is keen to take &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/&quot;&gt;a leadership role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in this, judging at least by the range of OA activities and initiatives it is involved in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, UC Libraries have been taking part in &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2009/01/22/uc-libraries-and-springer-sign-pilot-agreement-for-open-access-journal-publishing/&quot;&gt;OA pilots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since at least 2009, and since &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.ucsf.edu/open-access/policy/&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the University has introduced a series of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/&quot;&gt;open access policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then in 2015 &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/&quot;&gt;UC Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; launched the OA journal &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collabra.org/&quot;&gt;Collabra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Now &lt;i&gt;Collabra: Psychology&lt;/i&gt;) and an open access monograph publisher called &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luminosoa.org/&quot;&gt;Luminos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (some background &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-oa-interviews-alison-mudditt.html?m=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A year later (2016), the California Digital Library (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdlib.org/&quot;&gt;CDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) took part in &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://icis.ucdavis.edu/?page_id=286&quot;&gt;a joint study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; designed to estimate what the institutional costs would be if subscription journals were converted&lt;i&gt; en masse&lt;/i&gt; to an entirely APC business model. This was preparatory to proposing a “global flip” strategy in which a largescale conversion of subscription journals to pay-to-publish would be engineered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The US study came in the wake of a similar exercise undertaken by the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/&quot;&gt;Max Planck Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Max Planck concluded that there is already enough money in the system to pay for a large-scale transformation to OA and published its findings in a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2148961:7/component/escidoc:2149096/MPDL_OA-Transition_White_Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in April 2015. This became the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/learn_more/&quot;&gt;foundational document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the 2016 &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/&quot;&gt;OA2020 Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. UC followed up by overseeing the launch of a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.us/&quot;&gt;US version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of OA2020.

What is the endpoint being worked towards? What, in short, is the University’s current thinking on open access? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who better to put these questions to than &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.library.ucla.edu/content/virginia-steel&quot;&gt;Virginia Steel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the Norman and Armena Powell University Librarian at UCLA, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sparcopen.org/people/virginia-steel/&quot;&gt;Chair of the SPARC Steering Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Nuanced and undogmatic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast to many OA advocates in Europe, Steel’s views on open access are nuanced and undogmatic. For this reason, perhaps, she seems to be wary of “big idea” solutions like the global flip. As she puts it, “Succeeding with OA will require multiple models that will vary depending on disciplinary needs and the cultures and scholarly communications models of those disciplines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also appears to be more independently minded than many OA advocates, and not shy to challenge and question proposals she has doubts about – as evidenced by her decision in 2016 to write &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/Ginny-Steel_open-letter_OA2020-PIF_October-2016_0.pdf&quot;&gt;an open letter to the academic community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; setting out her concerns about the OA2020 Initiative and the notion of a “global flip”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steel’s approach is doubtless partly a product of the more democratic academic culture evident in the US. As a result, discussions about OA tend to major on voluntarism, persuasion and academic freedom, not compulsion, confrontation and punishment, as we see in Europe today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explaining the reasoning behind her more consensual approach Steel says, “Incentivising adherence to OA is better than compelling faculty to comply – the carrot will be better received than the stick – and it’s likely that more faculty will adopt OA practices sooner rather than later if they have a positive reason to do this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nor does Steel believe we can rush the transition to OA. “[T]urning the scholarly publication system upside down will probably take several decades,” she says, adding that convincing researchers to get on board “requires continued effort to explain, cajole, and convince”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The process cannot be hurried, she suggests, not just because it will require a lot of persuasion, but because there is still no consensus on many aspects of open access. As she puts it, “Making content openly available … will take time and discussion since there isn’t consensus on, say, whether or not content should be available for reuse by commercial publishers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This last point is an important one. It reminds us that there has never been consensus within the OA movement. It is for this reason that funders, universities and governments in Europe have adopted a top-down compulsory approach. The danger of this approach, however, is that it will diminish and erode important academic values, alienate key stakeholders, and maybe even prove counterproductive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other hand, the more &lt;i&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/i&gt; approach we see in the US might mean that by the time a consensus is reached, and by the time researchers have been persuaded in sufficient numbers of the merits of embracing OA, legacy publishers will have so fully embedded themselves into the OA environment, and indeed across the entire research workflow, that it will prove impossible to stand up to them, or even to contemplate doing without their services, whatever they might charge for those services. Such an outcome would mean that any hope of resolving the affordability problem would have to be abandoned, as would any hope of creating the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisage by BOAI.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In conclusion, the vision articulated at BOAI in 2002 has yet to be realised, and there must be doubts that it will be. For sure, we are seeing more research made open access, but it is often &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/uaw27/&quot;&gt;a fragile openness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the problem of affordability remains. Most disappointingly, the possibility of COAR’s “sustainable knowledge commons” ever becoming reality looks increasingly unlikely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It may be that I take too sceptical a view. but whatever happens, it is unclear to me that the European approach of confrontation and compulsion will prove any more successful than the US emphasis on persuasion and consensus building.

In fact, sitting in the middle of the OA revolution as we are, we might even be tempted to think that the outcome will depend as much on luck as on schemes, strategies and plans. Like Pierre Bezukhov wandering around the chaos of the Battle of Borodino in &lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt;, we might have to conclude that the actions of leaders, and of plans and policies, are far less effective than we like to think! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The interview with Virginia Steel is available in a pdf file &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardpoynder.co.uk/Interview_ginny_steel.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr align=&quot;left&quot; size=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;33%&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ftn1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoFootnoteText&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_ftn1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; “[M]ore documents are freely available in unsustainable sources and/or in violation of their copyright, than through sustainable and legal ways.” &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/uaw27/&quot;&gt;https://osf.io/uaw27/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ftn2&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoFootnoteText&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_ftn2&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoFootnoteReference&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Additional_resources&quot;&gt;73 universities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have introduced a Harvard-style OA policy to date, mostly institutions in the US. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Some rather jaw-dropping corrections for the French martyr saint of research integrity, Catherine Jessus, head of biology branch at the French CNRS, professor of developmental biology at Sorbonne University in Paris. Jessus is the feared CNRS executive whose case divided French academics and even media into loyal Stalinists and enemies of the people, after Sorbonne … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2018/08/01/catherine-jessus-case-journals-hide-behind-sorbonne-cope-to-avoid-retractions/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Catherine Jessus case: journals hide behind Sorbonne &amp;amp; COPE to avoid retractions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meta-nav&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;What does Mathematics have to do with Brain Biology? This is the question that NeuroMat's director, Antonio Galves, asks on his first post as a contributor to the &quot;Science &amp;amp; Mathematics&quot; blog of the Brazilian newspaper &lt;em&gt;O Globo&lt;/em&gt;. This post, originally in Portuguese, is brought here in English.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Science Exchange, the &lt;i&gt;leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;amp;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;™&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;, announces a collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2Flabs%2Faum-biotech-llc-philadelphia&amp;amp;esheet=51845295&amp;amp;newsitemid=20180731005356&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=AUM+BioTech&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=51f1a975784701a96bb036f3cfd7de4e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AUM BioTech&lt;/a&gt;, an emerging Philadelphia-based startup, to advance genetic research and significantly cut short drug discovery and development time. Science Exchange will now offer AUM BioTech’s self-delivering, next-generation RNA silencing products and alternatives to conventional CRISPR, siRNA and shRNA approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of this alliance, Science Exchange users will get instant access to AUM BioTech’s 300,000-plus customized and cutting-edge RNA silencing products targeting thousands of genetic targets powered by proprietary FANA technology, a technology platform composed of antisense oligonucleotide (AON) chemistries. These products can be used to target messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding (lncRNA) for a broad spectrum of genetic studies. They can also be used to target viral, fungal and bacterial RNA. AUM BioTech’s FANA antisense oligonucleotides (FANA ASOs) can be self-delivered both in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models without the use of any conjugates, carriers or formulations and can be used for basic and translational research. Such products will significantly benefit the biomedical scientific community working on difficult-to-transfect primary cells, including, but not limited to B-Cells, T-cells, macrophages, neuronal cells and primary cells from diseased donors. It is also important to mention that researchers working with animal models can use FANAs for their preclinical studies via multiple routes of administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With FANA, our goal is to shorten the drug discovery and development time and help bring clinical compounds to market much faster,” said Veenu Aishwarya, founder and CEO of AUM BioTech. “This strategic alliance with Science Exchange will grant its users on-demand access to our FANA technology and help them reduce the time and effort needed to understand the function of genes and their link to diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Political and business leaders who change their moral stance are perceived not as brave, but hypocritical and ineffective</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators considered President Obama’s reversal on same-sex marriage an act of courage. But this isn’t how the public usually perceives moral mind-changers, according to a team led by Tamar Kreps at the University of Utah. &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25112-001&quot;&gt;Their findings&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; suggest that leaders who shift from a moral stance don’t appear brave – they just look like hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34380&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted 15 studies, of which I’ll focus on one example that illustrates the core approach. Nearly 800 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk read scenarios where a member of the US Congress took a stance on either the death penalty or same-sex marriage. In some cases, their stance was pragmatic, indicated in their statement through phrases like “it’s a matter of not having to invest in the cost of changing government systems”. In other cases the justification for the stance was moral – “it’s a matter of justice.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants rated their initial feelings about the politician and then learned that he or she had since changed their tune, again making a statement based on either pragmatic or moral reasons. For example, a statement might read “It’s still a moral issue for me…I’ve realized, though, that we can never be 100 per cent certain that the convicted party is guilty, and truly defending justice means never taking the risk of killing an innocent victim.” Finally, participants rated the politicians again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When their initial stance was moral rather than pragmatic, the political leaders suffered costs and gained no benefits after changing their moral mind. Participants rated them as less effective, less worthy of support and more hypocritical, with the intensity of hypocrisy driving the other two negative judgments. Even those participants who agreed with moral mind-changers’ new position saw them as hypocritical, although slightly less so than other participants. At the same time, moral mind changers were seen as no more courageous, effective, or worthy of support, compared to the congress men and women who changed their initial pragmatically grounded position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kreps’s team found this same effect in various scenarios, including a manager deciding whether to take on an environmentally friendly supply system, politicians considering immigration reform, and business leaders considering whether to use sex to sell their products. One study used stimuli that more closely resembled real life through “attack ads” accusing an opponent of flip-flopping. Although not all of the 15 studies produced significant effects, a meta-analysis across all the data, involving nearly 6,000 participants, suggested a strong level of support for the core findings (a few non-significant studies were entirely to be expected given the size of the effect was modest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that abandoning a moral position will almost certainly cost you. Changing a key belief may put you at odds with friends and family and be seized on by your enemies, casting you as a commitment-breaker – as dishonest or inauthentic for sacrificing what you had said was a sacred cow (and all the more so if changing one’s moral position for pragmatic reasons, according to the studies that looked at this reason for change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one final study provided a “glimmer of hope” for evolving moral leaders. When participants heard that the leader’s moral shift was triggered by a transformative event, such as spending time with a death row inmate, they remained critical in terms of hypocrisy, but simultaneously rated them as more courageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the leadership literature to date has suggested there are only benefits to expressing moral positions, making this one of the first studies to show a potential downside, and – if leaders have an instinct for the effects shown here – it could explain why they are often keen to hold back from taking moral positions. Kreps and her colleagues conclude that “moral talk is not cheap – those who deviate from their initial moral views pay a price…and leaders may do well to avoid it in the absence of true, enduring conviction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25112-001&quot;&gt;Hypocritical flip-flop, or courageous evolution? When leaders change their moral minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>We’ve covered a number of stories about scientific whistleblowers here at Retraction Watch, so readers will likely be familiar with what often happens to them: Their motives are questioned, they are ostracized or pushed out of labs, or even accused of misconduct themselves. But there’s more to it, says Kathy Ahern in a recent paper … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/07/30/how-institutions-gaslight-whistleblowers-and-what-can-be-done/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;How institutions gaslight whistleblowers — and what can be done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallibility of eye-witness memory has been well-documented by psychologists, including how alcohol intoxication undermines witness accuracy &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3129&quot;&gt;still further&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, psychological research into the foibles of human memory and the implications this has for legal proceedings is arguably one of the best examples of the discipline making a practical contribution to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://annelies.vredeveldt.com&quot;&gt;Annelies Vredeveldt&lt;/a&gt; at VU University Amsterdam and her team explain in their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3414?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, there is a striking gap in the literature: “despite the frequency with which people use cannabis, there is almost no research examining its effects on eye-witness memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34354&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab research suggests that cannabis intoxication affects memory, including reducing the accuracy of recall and increasing the propensity for false memories. To test what this might mean in the context of cannabis affecting eye-witness memory (which has been studied just once before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9526721&quot;&gt;20 years ago&lt;/a&gt;), the researchers recruited and tested 55 sober participants entering coffee shops in Amsterdam (where cannabis is smoked and consumed in other ways) and compared their performance with 63 participants tested under the influence of cannabis who were recruited upon leaving a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers played all the participants a two-minute video of a staged shop robbery; gave them a two-minute filler task that involved Sudoku; and then two memory tests. The first test asked them to describe everything they could remember of the crime. The second asked them to look at a six-person police line up and say whether the robber was present or not, and to say how confident they were in their judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants under the influence of cannabis provided fewer accurate details of the crime, especially relating to descriptions of the people involved. This could have important real-life implications. “Arguably person descriptors are the most forensically relevant information in a place investigation, as it may lead the police to a suspect or contribute to the evidence incriminating or exonerating a suspect,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the line-ups, the cannabis intoxicated participants performed just as accurately as the sober participants, both at correctly identifying the suspect if he was present, or correctly noting his absence if he wasn’t there. What’s more, the intoxicated participants were more confident in their judgments, and there was a stronger correlation between their confidence and accuracy. The researchers surmised this greater insight could be due to the known effect of cannabis on increasing introspection and internal focus. This finding too could have real-life implications since it’s known that jurors and judges are influenced by witnesses’ confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study breaks new ground, but it’s not without some issues – for instance, the realism of recruiting coffee-shop patrons came at the expense of experimental control. There was no random allocation to conditions, for example, and the researchers didn’t have an accurate measure of their participants’ levels of intoxication. Vredeveldt and her team recommend that future research strive for greater experimental control, and they said it would be useful to find out whether the adverse effects of cannabis on recall dissipate once a witness sobers up.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: 7 principles of neuroscience every coach should know</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=1741</guid>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/7-principles-neuroscience-every-coach-know/</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5618 size-large&quot; height=&quot;618&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/brain-3535300_1920-1024x618.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coaching the brain with neuroscience in mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the mid-1990s when I was an undergrad, the core text of my neuroscience curriculum was &lt;i&gt;‘Principles of Neural Science’&lt;/i&gt; by Eric Kandel, James Schwartz and Thomas Jessell. Kandel won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on memory storage in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years before his Nobel, Kandel wrote a paper &lt;a class=&quot;broken_link&quot; href=&quot;http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=172780&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;A new intellectual framework for psychiatry’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The paper explained how neuroscience can provide new view of mental health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bipr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/7-Principles-of-Brain-based-Psychotherapy05.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Following on from Kandel’s paper&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the Yale School of Medicine proposed seven principles of brain-based therapy for psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists. The principles have been &lt;a class=&quot;broken_link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201005/what-coaches-can-learn-neuroscience-research&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;translated&lt;/a&gt; into&lt;strong&gt; practical applications for health &amp;amp; wellness, business, and life coaches. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most fundamental principle is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All mental processes, even the most complex psychological processes, derive from the operation of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insofar as psychotherapy or counseling is effective . . . it presumably does so through learning, by producing changes in gene expression that alter the strength of synaptic connections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, experience and environment influence brain development and functioning. &lt;strong&gt;This concept is now established in neuroscience and is often referred to as &lt;em&gt;neuroplasticity.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plenty of neuroscience research supports the idea that our brains remain adaptable (&lt;a class=&quot;broken_link&quot; href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/tag/neuroplasticity/&quot;&gt;or plastic&lt;/a&gt;) throughout our lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does neuroscience have to do with health, life or business coaching?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer: EVERYTHING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 5&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you’re a coach you can facilitate change in:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking (beliefs and attitudes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotions (more mindfulness and resilience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;behaviour (new healthy habits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coaching builds the psychological skills needed to support lasting change such as:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mindfulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resilience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and wellness coaching, in particular, are emerging as powerful interventions to help people initiate and maintain sustainable change (and yes, there is research to back this up! &lt;a href=&quot;http://trenchhealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Coaching-Am-Journal-Physical-Medicine-Dec-2011.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Check out a list of RCTs in table 2 of this paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of Kandel, Cappas and colleagues thoughts on how neuroscience can be applied to therapy and coaching…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seven principles of neuroscience &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; coach should know.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Both nature and nurture win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both genetics and the environment interact in the brain to shape our brains and influence behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy or coaching can be thought of as a strategic and purposeful ‘environmental tool’ to facilitate change and may be an effective means of shaping neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Experience transforms the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The areas of our brain associated with emotions and memories such as the pre-frontal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus are not hard-wired (they are ‘plastic’). Circuits in our brain change in response to experiences, not just during development, after injury, or during learning and memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  Memories are imperfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our memories are not a perfect account of what happened. Memories can be reconstructed at the time when we recall them depending on how we retrieve the memory.  For example, a question, photograph or a particular scent can interact with a memory resulting in it being modified as it is recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increasing life experience we weave narratives into their memories.  Autobiographical memories that tell the story of our lives are always undergoing revision precisely because our sense of self is too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciously or not, we use imagination to reinvent our past, and with it, our present and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Emotion underlies memory formation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories, emotions, and feelings are interconnected neural processes. The amygdala, which plays a role in emotional arousal, mediate neurotransmitters essential for memory consolidation. Emotional arousal has the capacity to activate the amygdala, which in turn modulates the storage of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Relationships are the foundation for change &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic relationship has the capacity to help clients modify neural systems and enhance emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships in adulthood have the power to elicit positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Imagining and doing are the same (to the brain).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental imagery or visualisation not only activates the same brain regions as the actual behaviour but also can speed up the learning of a new skill. Envisioning a different life may as successfully invoke change as the actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. We don’t always know what our brain is ‘thinking’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconscious processes exert great influence on our thoughts, feelings, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain can process nonverbal and unconscious information, and information processed unconsciously can still influence therapeutic and other relationships. It’s possible to react to unconscious perceptions without consciously understanding the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[hr]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;display: inline !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Cappas et al note that this list is not exhaustive. This blog post should serve as a jumping-off point for considering coaching through a neuroscience lens. Psychologists, therapists and coaches face the challenge of understanding and treating the whole person with biological, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. Its possible knowledge of the brain and mind can enhance this practice, and begin to inform new strategies consistent with neuroscience principles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Meditation-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world with so much buzz around us, it can be difficult to unplug from work and not think about the never-ending list of things to do. Stress accumulates…. If you can relate to these statements (let’s be honest, most of us will), you might search for ways to de-stress, and people are becoming increasingly aware of using mindfulness to unwind from the perpetual to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness, in the form of meditation practice, has been around for thousands of years, originating when Buddhism emerged in India. Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the leaders of merging mindfulness with science without the religious aspect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/clipsy.bpg016&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;describes mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; as focusing on the present moment with awareness and acceptance without judging. As mindfulness increased in popularity, it has emerged as a fruitful topic for investigation in the fields of neuroscience and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in the function and structure of the brain have been found in long-term meditation practitioners, such as changes in brain activity within areas associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.08.024&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social and emotional behavior&lt;/a&gt;, and increased volume of the brain in regions involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.12.061&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory, emotion regulation, and higher-order functioning&lt;/a&gt;. Even just a short-term mindfulness-meditation intervention &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2015.12.001&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in elementary school students&lt;/a&gt; can lead to lowered social anxiety, aggression, and cortisol levels (related to lower stress levels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Lama &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=4&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBso32upnbAhXkJMAKHV0YCxcQFgg2MAM&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%2Fabout%2FHealing_Emotions.html%3Fid%3Dc8gGAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZwXFMsEfLzmnrx9ZlUkkd&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emphasized&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with Western practitioners how compassion is related to the release of suffering. This philosophy has been transferred to mindfulness training and has been shown to aid in freeing the body from mental and physical stress and “self”, as has historically been shown by meditators being able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://magic-magic-tricks.knoji.com/how-to-lie-on-a-bed-of-nails-the-old-east-indian-trick/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rest on a bed of nails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How mindfulness improves cognitive abilities and mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarizing the effects of mindfulness training across many studies in adults, we see an overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2013.05.005&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decrease in anxiety, depression, and stress&lt;/a&gt; in clinical and non-clinical groups. These effects were, importantly, similar to those seen following other forms of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or pharmacological treatments. The mindfulness findings were further extended to a youth-only sample, where mindfulness was found to be particularly effective for&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-013-0260-4&quot;&gt; treating &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-013-0260-4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Mindfulness interventions therefore appear to be moderately effective in a wide variety of age groups and populations. These effects could be explained by mindfulness improving ‘cognitive control’, a broad term referring to higher-order cognitive skills, such as attention shifting, cognitive flexibility, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness focuses on attention and our ability to regulate our emotions, as the goal is to stay focused in the present moment and notice any thoughts or emotions that you might experience in that specific moment. Our ability to maintain this cognitive control can be influenced by behavioral and psychological problems in childhood and adolescence. This raises the question of whether training in cognitive control in early childhood can help prevent later behavioral and psychological issues. While we don’t yet know the answer to this question, it has been shown that ten hours of mindfulness training in 4-5 year old children can lead to significant improvements in cognitive control (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-017-0770-6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;). Studies following up these children as they develop will help us to understand how long these effects persist for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are still being researched. The ability to ignore physical pain just by focusing on external or internal stimuli requires the engagement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awg102&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;frontal brain regions&lt;/a&gt; that are also involved in cognitive control. Since there are several clinical populations who have difficulties with cognitive control (i.e., dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, eating disorders), mindfulness can potentially be an option for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/clipsy.bpg015&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;additional therapies&lt;/a&gt; to normalize cognitive control abilities, and to improve overall functioning and outcomes for these populations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://brainsciencepodcast.libsyn.com/bs-147-eve-marders-life-in-neuroscience</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;BS 147 is a discussion of the new biography &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2L7KP7I&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons from the Lobster: Eve Marder's Work in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Charlotte Nassim. This is an intellectual biography of one of neuroscientists least know pioneers. Dr. Marder was interviewed on this podcast back in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/interview-with-neuroscience-pioneer-eve-marder-phd-bsp-56.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BSP 56&lt;/a&gt;, which is also now free to download.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this episode I take you through some of Dr. Marder's key discoveries. Her work is unique because even as a graduate student she was challenging long held assumptions in her field. Although Nassim never mentions it, I strongly believe that Marder deserves a Nobel Prize and I explain why in this episode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This episode is more technical than usual and will be of special interest to students and working neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For complete show notes and transcripts please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainsciencepodcast.com&quot;&gt;http://brainsciencepodcast.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please visit our sponsors at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/ginger&quot;&gt;http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/ginger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://babbel.com&quot;&gt;http://babbel.com&lt;/a&gt;.

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Celebrating 20 years since Watts &amp;amp; Strogatz&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sJGQv3QR0559qeWA0rQ5GA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: pixabay,com&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 4th 2018 marked twenty years since Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz published their epochal paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.squarespace.com/static/5436e695e4b07f1e91b30155/t/54452561e4b08d9eb2170909/1413817697054/collective-dynamics-of-small-world-networks.pdf&quot;&gt;“Collective Dynamics of Small-World Networks’&lt;/a&gt;’ in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. It is my favourite paper of all time. Elegantly written, the weightless prose outlined a staggeringly simple idea, yet hid a staggering depth of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that simple idea changed the lives of thousands of scientists, creating a whole new field of research. Research into how people are connected, how disease spreads, how rumours start, how music and fashion changes, how to stop power grids from browning out, or the internet from collapsing. Which means this paper likely changed your life too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with crickets. The chirpy buggers. Steve Strogatz was and is fascinated by anything that synchronises. And crickets sure do love to synchronise their chirps, the irritating insect. So he set his graduate student Duncan Watts the task of working out how a bunch of crickets in a field could synchronise together, how they listen to each other and subtly adjust the timing of their chirps to match the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts ran into a problem: how to represent the way the crickets listened to each other. If you just assumed that crickets listened to their neighbours, then they’d never synchronise, for as the chirping aligned in one little group on one side of the field, it wouldn’t synchronise with the chirps on the other side. You could assume that every cricket had telepathic knowledge of every other cricket so that they were all linked. But crickets are not, to our knowledge, telepaths. Actually, now he came to think about it, there were lots of ways in which crickets could listen to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Watts started thinking about representing the crickets in a way he could play with. Make each cricket a node, and the link between a pair of nodes is then a pair of crickets that could hear each other. Great. What then was the best pattern of links for synchronising the cricket’s chirping?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, presumably something where one cricket could hear many other crickets in its group (and they could hear each other), yet any cricket was only a few links from any other. That way each group could synchronise locally, yet transmit that synchronisation to all other groups quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was that pattern of links? It wasn’t a regular pattern, for that would have crickets far apart; and it wasn’t a random pattern, for that would not have each cricket hearing many other crickets in its group. It was as though the pattern of links needed to be between regular and random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was between regular and random? Contemplating this problem, Watts recalled the urban legend of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation&quot;&gt;six degrees of separation&lt;/a&gt; — that there was a short chain of five acquaintances between any randomly chosen person and the President of the USA (this used to be considered a good thing). This had to be a clue. People sit in their local groups of friends, yet according to legend there is just a few links of acquaintance joining widely differing people. Social networks seem neither regular nor random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Watts asked his boss, Strogatz: “hey boss, what’s between regular and random?” The reply: “no one knows. But it’s a cool problem. So let’s find out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their famous model boiled down the answer to its bare essentials. It tuned a single network between regular and random to reveal what was “in between”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the regular end. Take a ring of nodes, and add to each the same number of links. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WlHkB-PXG4Glhriwk5gnLQ.png&quot; /&gt;A regular network, made by a ring of nodes. Nodes close together are inter-linked; but to get to the other side of the ring means crossing many, many links&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a regular network, in which each node sits in a group, as its neighbours also tend to be each others’ neighbours. But to get one from side of the ring to the other takes many, many jumps across many, many links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s skip to the random end. We do this by re-wiring the regular network. Randomly select a link sticking out of one node, and re-wire that link to any randomly chosen other node. Do that to every link, and the end result is a random network: it takes now just a few links to get from any node to any other, but the neighbourhoods of tightly inter-linked nodes have been destroyed. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JCTUx3H_xBwrP2Xgr65b1g.png&quot; /&gt;A random network on a ring of nodes. The nodes are still laid out in a ring, but now almost every link has been rewired: so we can cross the ring quickly, but neighbouring nodes are no longer inter-linked&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts and Strogatz’ breakthrough was to realise that something special would happen if you rewired just a handful of links. Re-wire just a few and, suddenly, the average number of links between any two nodes becomes tiny. Yet all nodes are still heavily linked into their local groups. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cs5s6ZrURb7qUL5KEhKFTQ.png&quot; /&gt;A small-world network on a ring of nodes. With just a handful of rewired links, it takes now on average about two links to cross from one side to the other. Yet neighbouring nodes are still interlinked.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dang that looked like a network of society, a network of groups of friends linked by acquaintances. Where you might be linked to anyone else by a short chain of friends, giving you the sensation that it was a small world, after all. And lo, they called it: the small-world network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w6wkTJlEZDTcl63iKTeZZA.png&quot; /&gt;The whole model: take a ring of nodes, connect locally with a few links each, and set a probability (p) of rewiring each link. With p=0, the network is regular; with p=1, the network is random. But when p is just a bit more than 0, a small-world network results.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every real-world network they tested turned out to be a small-world. The network of appearances in the same films by actors. The power grid network of the Western USA. The nervous system of the tiny worm C Elegans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that basically anything we can describe as a network is a small-world. The network of social interactions between dolphins in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. The internet. The Marvel Comic universe. Train networks in India. The protein interactions of yeast. Roget’s Thesaurus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this simple idea launched a thousand careers. For if we’d missed such a simple idea about the world until 1998, what else had we missed about the world? What else could networks tell us? Researchers rushed in from all walks of life in academia, from pure maths, through statistical mechanics, on to computer science, across molecular biology, genetics, and neuroscience, to ecology, literary theory, and even palaeontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all found in networks the lodestone they’d been searching for, a unifying idea to describe their data. And so networks now became the foundation of research into how diseases spread, how genes interact, how social networks function, how social media can be hijacked for nefarious ends, how to protect power grids and the internet from attack, and how to search through any network. All of which has changed the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredibly much of this work was anticipated in Watts and Strogatz’ paper. They spent much of its length explaining this small-world model of a network clearly, so that everyone could understand it. And everyone did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But towards the end it suddenly shifted gear to get into the deep implications: what does this small-world mean for how the system behaves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The “dynamics” of the paper’s title. To get an idea of how deep this final section, Watts &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6768.html&quot;&gt;wrote a boo&lt;/a&gt;k in 1999 that was essentially the full version of the paper. Each sentence in the final paragraph of results in the paper was one long chapter in the book. Ouch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For surely something tuned between regular and random would not behave the same as either a regular or random network. And indeed, the results were rich and deep and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They first tackled the dynamics of how viruses spread. If we want to know how an infectious disease — the flu, say — spreads, then we need to know how people come into contact. And Watts and Strogatz now had on their hands the very best model of contacts between people. So they simulated a simple model of how infections spread between people by contact: choose a small number of initially infected people, choose how infectious the disease is — how likely a person is to catch it after being in contact with an infected person — and watch the infection spread across the links. As you might suspect, on their small-world networks infectious diseases spreads very easily, much more easily than in the standard models used by epidemiologists. This paragraph of the paper launched a whole new way of thinking about the spread of disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tackled cellular automata — simple systems where each node dumbly obeys a simple rule based on what its neighbours are doing. But on a small-world network its neighbours are both near and far: this led to some mind-bendingly complicated dynamics from simple rules. They tackled games, where nodes represent players co-operating or competing for rewards, like the famous Prisoner’s Dilemma. Both of these kick-started research programmes into the deep lessons of simple dynamics on complex networks. Ecology, the study of how species interact, was revolutionised by the study of these simple dynamics, as ecologists set about applying these lesson using their networks, networks representing who eats or co-operates with who.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally they tackled synchrony, closing the loop on where they’d started, a nod to the cricket problem that kicked it all off. They made each node into an independent little oscillator, and watched what happened as they tuned the network from regular to random. Just as Watts had guessed at the start, they found that just a few rewired links were enough to cause synchrony across an entire network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A result they presciently predicted would have great implications for neuroscience. And indeed the whole of what we now call “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/netn&quot;&gt;network neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;” was born of this paper, thanks to the early work of, amongst others, Olaf Sporns, Ed Bullmore, Sophie Achard, Dani Bassett, and Marcus Kaiser. (Like Pooh Bear, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002051&quot;&gt;also had&lt;/a&gt; a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16615219&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific papers are universally dull, dry affairs. They report new results in precise language, with little scope for flair. We scientists read them, assimilate their message — and if expert in the area may take a close, eyebrow-arched look at their methods, results and interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not jump up and down in excitement when reading. We do not then rush off to tell all our friends about the paper we just read. About how much we &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it. Watts and Strogatz’ small-world paper evoked these reactions. Twenty years later people still remember the sensation of reading it for the first time. The fervour it created was remarkable, has lasted for two decades, and shows no sign of dying out. It created “network science”. It’s extraordinary legacy has touched the lives of millions, perhaps billions of people. How can one little paper have spread so far, have such an extraordinary impact? Well it is a small world, after all…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

	<title>BMC Series blog: Can you learn how to be empathic? A new nursing education intervention says yes</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/07/27/can-you-learn-how-to-be-empathic-a-new-nursing-education-intervention-says-yes/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/nursing-carer-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Manitoba, Canada, worked towards the development of a promising &lt;em&gt;Heart Heath Whispering&lt;/em&gt; intervention, seen as needed to fill a gap in nursing health promotion education, as they state:  ‘Training opportunities to foster confidence and skills in empathetic counselling are needed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the high cost and low quality of life associated with chronic illness, an effective counselling system that could help people to change their health risk behaviors could represent a useful upstream approach to prevent illness instead of treating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43744/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health risk behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, such as smoking, binge eating or lack of exercise, are often tied to very personal situations and stressful variables, which can be difficult to face in counselling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly clear if we consider the example of family carers, a big segment of the population that tends to engage in health risk behaviors, due to high expectations and stressors associated with facing both caregiving and employment challenges. Unfortunately, carers often report a feeling of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755722311001621?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not being heard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691710000468?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;or understood by care providers&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter were perceived as not concerned for their wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, nurses describe a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2296-11-41&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lack of motivation to counsel&lt;/a&gt;, due either to clients’ resistance or to lack of empathy, patience or time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors explain that only ‘when nursing students make it a priority to perspective-take, empathically listen, and discern the carer’s unique circumstances’ is the carer bolstered to take ownership for his or her own health risk behaviors. Moreover, ‘the capacity of nurses to demonstrate clinical empathy is best achieved at the student level, while their attitudes and skills are being formed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students receiving the training reported that perspective-taking enhanced their ‘exploring skills’ and made them feel greater clinical empathy ….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the authors developed the &lt;em&gt;Heart Health Whispering&lt;/em&gt; intervention, ‘a novel person-centered approach for counselling and health promotion.’ Through video-tagging sessions between nursing students and carer actors, they tested how nursing students could learn clinical empathy, especially through self-evaluation and perspective-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective-taking&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Perspective-taking&lt;/a&gt; is a teachable component which, in this context, aims to sensitizes the clinicians to be aware of their own thoughts and feelings regarding risk behaviors, to control them in order to enter ‘in the client’s shoes,’ and to seek validation of his/her inferences of the client’s viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training clinical empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-018-0291-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In this pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to learn clinical empathy was tested in nursing students either receiving or not perspective-taking instructions and training, taking into account both students’ and carer actors’ perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students receiving the training reported that perspective-taking enhanced their ‘exploring skills’ and made them feel greater clinical empathy, highlighting the potential importance of introducing such training, once standardized, into educational curricula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their recorded dialogue with the carer actor, students of both groups demonstrated empathy, even if one group did not receive a preparation training of perspective-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, carers rating of the students empathy was higher than the students’ self-assessment and, even more unexpected, carers found the students who did not receive the training more empathic than the others, who seemed sometimes ‘not delving enough’, ‘inauthentic’ or ‘paternalistic.’ It is possible that the trained students ‘were struggling with practicing their new skills resulting in poorer performance than students’ of the other group, who likely were less distracted and just focused on their previously acquired skills, the authors suggest in their discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carers and students were able to see their recorded dialogue, and this afterwards ‘video analysis’ encouraged self-awareness in the students, who referred to this practice as ‘eye-opening’ and ‘a good way to learn.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that the results of this pilot study ‘appeared promising and warrant further testing.’ The &lt;em&gt;Heart Heath Whispering&lt;/em&gt; intervention ‘has implications for ongoing empirical work to … bolster clinician clinical empathy so as to avoid “jumping ahead of the patient” when engaging in therapeutic conversations on carer self-care.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is great potential value of such a technique, which gives the students the opportunity to self-evaluate and practice in taking the patients’ perspective, as the long-term goal is to alter health risk behavior choices of family carers  and promoting health care by increasing counselors’ communication skills and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have proposed an explanation for why Ouija board users feel as though a spirit is moving the planchette (an ornate pointer) and spelling out messages. It is based on the idea that two (or more) living users unwittingly take turns at controlling the planchette, cooperating implicitly to create a message that starts out random but becomes more predictable as the number of meaningful options decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that meaningful responses from the Ouija board are an emergent property of interacting predictive minds that increasingly impose structure on initially random events in the sessions,” Marc Andersen at Aarhus University and his colleagues explain in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11097-018-9585-8&quot;&gt;open-access paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34347&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers travelled to a Ouija board conference and rigged up pairs of board users with eye-tracking equipment. This is the first time the Ouija board practice has been studied outside of a psych lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40 participants’ eye movements were recorded in two conditions as they worked in pairs: when using the Ouija board in the usual way for 10 minutes, and in a “voluntary” condition in which they spelt out the letters and words given to them by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andersen and his colleagues were interested in predictive eye movements in which the participant glanced to a letter ahead of the planchette landing on it (which would suggest the board user knew where the planchette was headed, presumably often as a result of their planned purposeful movement of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, individual participants made many more predictive eye movements in the voluntary condition – they knew where they and their partner were moving the planchette and frequently glanced ahead to the appropriate letter. These predictive eye movements were much rarer (38 per cent lower) when using the Ouija board in the usual way. Much of our sense of ownership over our own actions comes from the fact that our brain predicts the consequences of them, so it follows that when participants were less able to predict the movement of the planchette in the usual Ouija condition, they felt less ownership over those movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two key details in the Ouija board condition further help to explain how these apparently less purposeful movements create meaningful messages: first, when looking to see whether at least one participant in a pair made a predictive eye movement, the rates of prediction were just as high as for individuals in the voluntary condition (i.e. for any given move of the planchette, at least one person usually knew where it was going); second, rates of prediction increased in the Ouija board condition, but not the voluntary condition, presumably as the participants became increasingly aware of the diminishing number of meaningful options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, part of the explanation for the spooky sensation of the Ouija board controlling itself to write a comprehensible message is that participants are effectively taking turns: they underestimate their own contribution, and at the same time their partner’s purposeful movement gives the sense of the planchette moving of its own accord (such an account is consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/301/5630/187&quot;&gt;prior research&lt;/a&gt; showing how we tend to underestimate the force of our own movements compared with others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, overlaid on this are the participants’ beliefs, which appear to have a retrospective effect on their (lack of) sense of control  – the researchers found that the participants who believed more strongly that Ouija boards can be used to communicate with ghosts and spirits were more likely to say afterwards that they felt the planchette had moved on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11097-018-9585-8&quot;&gt;Predictive minds in Ouija board sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, my wife and I were window shopping in the Brighton lanes when we decided to enter a posh perfume store to take a closer sniff. A smiling sales woman approached and, to our delight, offered us each a complimentary glass of sparking wine and some nibbles. Soon though, our glee turned to discomfort: could we really just walk out having enjoyed the freebies? Conspiring like thieves, we decided that although we wouldn’t buy anything (not that we could have afforded to), we had better stay and look interested a while longer; we even dropped a false hint to the woman at our likely return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a team of researchers led by &lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text given-name&quot;&gt;Xiling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Xiong&lt;/span&gt; at Zhejiang University in China, my wife and I&lt;/span&gt; were suffering from an acute bout of reciprocation anxiety. In their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487017304877&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Xiong and his colleagues propose that this is not just a state, but a trait – a specific kind of social anxiety – that some of us are more prone to than others, and what’s more, they’ve created a new questionnaire to measure it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34325&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Reciprocity Anxiety Scale comprises eleven items that respondents must rate their (dis)agreement with on a five-point scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_34326&quot; style=&quot;width: 1292px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-07-24 16.33.48.png&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-34326&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;34326&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screenshot 2018-07-24 16.33.48&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/screenshot-2018-07-24-16-33-48.png?w=845?w=845&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/screenshot-2018-07-24-16-33-48.png?w=845?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/screenshot-2018-07-24-16-33-48.png?w=845&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1292,1098&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/26/does-receiving-favours-and-freebies-make-you-uncomfortable-maybe-you-have-reciprocity-anxiety/screenshot-2018-07-24-16-33-48/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/screenshot-2018-07-24-16-33-48.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;From &lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487017304877&quot;&gt;Xiong et al 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale taps two related components of reciprocity anxiety: &lt;em&gt;avoidance&lt;/em&gt;, both of receiving favours/help/compliments and of feeling the need to reciprocate these things (factor 1) and &lt;em&gt;distress&lt;/em&gt;, not only about not being able to reciprocate, but also at what others will think if you don’t (factor 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;The researchers believe reciprocity anxiety is likely to be greater the bigger a favour and the more public its receipt. They think it’s a trait that companies should take an interest in – while loyalty schemes, vouchers and other freebies have obvious appeal to many customers, results from two initial studies suggested that these marketing strategies are actually likely to deter others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Xiong and his team first asked hundreds of volunteers to complete the new scale and then to imagine a scenario in which a shop cashier offered a 20 per cent discount voucher off the whole purchase and any further purchases (and that she wants you to use it), and another in which a waiter as a favour gave a free money-off coupon before recommending a pricey desert. Higher scorers in reciprocity anxiety were more likely to say they would refuse the discount voucher in the shop, and that they would feel obliged to order the expensive pudding at the restaurant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, volunteers imagined a shop attendant offering them a free drink and plate full of snacks. Afterwards, high scorers in reciprocity anxiety scored lower for customer satisfaction and they said they would be less willing to visit the store again and less willing to spread a good word about the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reciprocity works to establish a psychological bond” between customer and firm, the researchers said, but the discomfort it causes can backfire among those high in reciprocity anxiety, especially if they feel the benefits reflect badly on them or that they will struggle to reciprocate (around 18 per cent of people tested in these new studies scored highly in the trait; age and gender were unrelated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Xiong’s team suggest that it may in future be possible to detect customers’ levels of reciprocity anxiety through their “behavioural residue” (such as through their choice of language and social media habits) and then firms could target marketing strategies appropriately. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;The new scale needs more testing, including looking at whether it can predict actual behaviour, not just people’s responses to hypotheticals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;It’s easy to be sceptical when psychologists propose another new trait (many will feel this is just a manifestation of social anxiety), but it strikes me as an interesting concept to explore further, including in non-commercial contexts. For example, I wonder how it might impact the ways that people manage their friendships and other relationships – perhaps high scorers in reciprocity anxiety are inclined to turn down invitations, seek help or receive other friendly favours, putting them at risk of loneliness and isolation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And yet however one defines it, it is clearly casting the research community in a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndr.de/der_ndr/presse/More-than-5000-German-scientists-have-published-papers-in-pseudo-scientific-journals,fakescience178.html&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/07/19/la-france-fait-partie-des-gros-contributeurs-aux-revues-scientifiques-douteuses_5333431_1650684.html&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-indias-fake-research-paper-shops-pay-publish-profit-5265402/&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Hugely controversial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever the truth (and likely predatory publishing is some mix of the above) the topic is a hugely controversial one and engenders bitter disputes. For instance, the person who coined the term predatory publisher –  &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Beall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – has been the recipient of a constant stream of verbal attacks and legal threats, not least because he created the foundational blacklist of what he calls “potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers”. Beall also regularly publishes articles (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/525/514&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in which he maintains that predatory publishing is a direct consequence of open access, and that OA has as a result &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.4open-sciences.org/articles/fopen/abs/2018/01/fopen180001s/fopen180001s.html&quot;&gt;thrown scholarly publishing into “crisis mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many were not surprised, therefore, when last year Beall’s site &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/&quot;&gt;disappeared overnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And shortly afterwards he &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;left his post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the University of Colorado without explanation (that I am aware of). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;b&gt;Update 22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;nd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt; July&lt;/b&gt;: On the same day I posted this an interview with Beall was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Indian Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in which he offered &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jeffrey-beall-american-librarian-predatory-publishers-threaten-scientific-integrity-are-embarrassment-to-india-5266858/&quot;&gt;his explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; as to why he left his job.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To add to the confusion, as concern grew, and both blacklists (e.g. Beall’s list, now &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;Cabells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and whitelists (e.g. the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) began to appear, a new problem emerged: even if an OA publisher tries to be honest and straightforward and has the papers submitted to it assessed in a diligent manner, it may at any point (and for whatever reason) be deemed by the community to be predatory. As a result, all those researchers who have published with it can expect to suffer reputational damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given these complexities, I plan to use the term predatory publishing in this article in a very specific way. I will be referring to those OA publishers who clearly and deliberately trick researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;– essentially, by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;failing to provide the promised (or even a meaningful) service and/or deceiving them about the nature of that service, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;simply in order to extract money from them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will not name any publishers, or journals, but simply refer to some of the deceptive practices they engage in that I know take place. I know they take place because I am regularly contacted by the victims of such unethical behaviour, and these victims share with me the details of what has happened to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, for instance, the publishers/journals I am talking about often do not inform authors at the point of submission that they will be charged an APC if their paper is accepted. And they often tell them (or imply) that the papers they publish are properly peer-reviewed where in reality they are not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s true, there are also some dishonest researchers who deliberately seek out predatory publishers in order to bulk up their CVs. Nevertheless, I have been contacted by a sufficiently large number of scholars who have been tricked by unscrupulous OA publishers that I am confident there is a serious problem out there. And it leads me to believe that a great many of the researchers who publish in these journals are hapless victims of a scam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my view, predatory publishing (or whatever you choose to call it) is a serious problem and a solution will eventually have to be found. Here, however, I am concerned primarily with the victims of predatory publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The consequences can be serious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When authors fall victim to a predatory publisher the consequences can be serious. Not only will they be conned into handing over (usually public) money for a service that is never (or very inadequately) provided, but (more seriously for them) their reputation (and likely their career) may be negatively impacted as a result. Unsurprisingly, therefore, victims of predatory publishers experience a great deal of anguish, anger and resentment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What surprises me is that while no one can agree on what predatory publishing is, or how prevalent or damaging it is, there nevertheless appears to be a consensus that if anyone falls victim to one of these publishers they have only themselves to blame. In other words, it is viewed as an individual failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, I view predatory publishing as a community problem. And, as such, I believe the community has a responsibility to come up with a solution for those researchers who become victims. After all, as I &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/09/predatory-publishing-modest-proposal.html&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; three years ago, predatory publishing could not exist without the co-operation of the research community – e.g. by universities and funders encouraging researchers to engage in pay-to-publish gold OA, and by (often senior) researchers agreeing to join the editorial boards of journals they know little or nothing about, in which they are unlikely ever to publish themselves, and for which they will probably never do any reviewing or editorial work. (Yes, I know, some researchers say they are listed on EBs without having opted-in, but many clearly do volunteer, if only because it adds another line to their CVs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To my mind, the community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s apparent lack of concern for the victims of predatory publishing represents a moral failure on its part. Certainly, that was the conclusion I reached recently when – during the same week – I was contacted by two different researchers from two different continents (neither, by the way, were from the global South, which is commonly said to be where most victims of predatory publishing are based).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In both cases, the researchers (and their co-authors) had inadvertently submitted papers to predatory publishers. As a result, both had quickly discovered that if you mistakenly submit a paper to a predatory publisher it can be difficult to extricate yourself from what is inevitably a distressing situation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is difficult because the victims of a predatory publisher are likely to discover what has happened only after their paper has been published, or when they receive an invoice (for sometimes thousands of dollars) with a demand that they pay up ASAP. The realisation that they have been conned will, of course, make them angry. But the more distressing moment comes when they realise that their name and reputation are now forever linked to a predatory publisher – unless they can persuade the publisher to take their paper down again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first researcher who contacted me realised something had gone wrong when the manuscript that he and his co-authors had submitted was returned to them with no peer review reports attached and no suggested changes. There was, however, a note to say that it had been accepted, and could they please pay the attached invoice. They later learned that the paper had already been published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quickly realising what had happened, and desperate to recover the situation, the authors agreed to pay the publisher the journal’s full APC (over $2,000) – not for publishing their paper, but for taking it down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even then, they discovered that several copies of the paper had been posted on the publisher’s site and one was still publicly available. In addition, copies (with the publisher’s name attached) were proliferating across the Web, including on a number of paper sharing sites (Oh the joys of CC BY!). They had emailed me in the hope that I could offer some advice, and perhaps approach the publisher on their behalf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second author who contacted me had likewise realised that he and his co-authors had submitted their latest paper to a predatory journal. And even though they refused to pay the publication fee, their paper was published. In addition, they discovered that the publisher was seeking to get it indexed on &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/&quot;&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Since the journal in question is listed in PubMed, as are a number of the publisher’s other journals, this was a real possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately, after I became involved the first paper was fully removed from the publisher’s web site, and the second one had a retraction notice attached to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, I know these things go on because over the past 7 years I have had many researchers like these contact me with tales of the nefarious deeds that predatory publishers engage in. Interestingly, sometimes they turn to me only after their university’s counsel has failed to resolve the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have always been happy to try and help, but I have also always been aware that even though I am often able to resolve the situation, I cannot provide a scalable solution. It is a time-consuming process and I am just one person working on their own. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is one reason why I believe a community solution is essential, but it is certainly not the most compelling one. The more important reason is that since it is the wider research community that has created the monster that predatory publishing has become the community has a responsibility to help the victims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Aside from the fact that many members of this community are willing to sit on the editorial boards of predatory journals, the community supports and promotes the pay-to-publish business model that created the conditions for predatory publishing. And when the problem became apparent the community either denied there was a problem or simply sat on its hands and allowed the problem to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But who should organise a community solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One organisation that could surely play a useful role is the Committee on Publication Ethics (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). This is an organisation, after all, that says it is “committed to educate and support editors, publishers and those involved in publication ethics with the aim of moving the culture of publishing towards one where ethical practices becomes the norm, part of the publishing culture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As it happens I discovered last year that in 2016 COPE published a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/case/withdrawal-accepted-manuscript-predatory-journal&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; exemplifying the kind of deceptive practices predatory publishers engage in, and in which it mooted a solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The COPE case study points out that because, as a rule, predatory publishers do not ask for copyright to be assigned to them, authors are able to demand that their paper is taken down. Once they have done that, the case study adds, they can then resubmit the paper to a “legitimate journal” with an editorial note explaining what had happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPE goes on to explain how the author highlighted in the case study wrote to the predatory journal that had tricked her to say, “Immediately remove my article from your website. If you do not do so immediately, I will take legal action”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the publisher asked for the name of the article and the journal in which it had been published, the author provided the information and repeated that she would proceed with legal action if the article was not removed from the journal’s website by a given date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The case study concludes by saying that the author, “will now proceed with submission to a legitimate journal, and the editor of the legitimate journal is comfortable that duplicate publication is no longer a problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leaving aside the fact that predatory publishers are routinely robbing the public purse, this might, at first sight, seem a practical solution for victims. After all, the sole objective of a predatory publisher is to make money, not “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/career-advice-article/tips-to-avoid-predatory-journals-and-conferences/&quot;&gt;to advance knowledge and share new scientific and research findings following an established and rigorous peer review process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. Having been paid an APC, the publisher will have achieved that objective. And if an author refuses to pay up the publisher can hold the paper hostage until a withdrawal fee is paid. Ironically, the worse the publisher’s reputation the more leverage it has in demanding a high withdrawal fee since the more desperate researchers will be to dissociate themselves from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, having a predatory publisher take down a captured paper only solves half the problem for the victim; in order to recover the situation the author also needs to find an alternative journal willing to republish it. The case study might seem to imply that this is a formality. But is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Curious to find out, I suggested to one of the researchers who contacted me that he try the method proposed in the COPE case study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;“Your current submission cannot be considered further”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks later the author reported back to say that he had sent his paper to a widely recognised OA publisher, and had received the following reply: “Unfortunately, once a paper has been formally published anywhere, even in a predatory journal without the author’s agreement, it still counts as a double submission and therefore your current submission cannot be considered further by us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the problem may have been that the author contacted the legitimate journal before his paper had been removed from the predatory journal. Nevertheless, if the editor who replied had read the COPE case study (and accepted its argument) a more helpful reply would surely have gone along the lines of, “I am sorry to hear that this has happened to you. Can I suggest you ask the predatory publisher to take down your paper? Once that has been done I would be happy to consider sending it out for review.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, I emailed the editor and copied in COPE. I referred to the case study and asked whether the publisher of the journal was a member of COPE. I also asked why the editor seemed unwilling to help authors who have fallen victim to a predatory publisher (in contrast to the publisher in the COPE case study).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The editor replied that the publisher he represented was indeed a member of COPE and “follows COPE guidelines in dealing with cases of publication ethics.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added, however, “the COPE advice to which you refer was given at a COPE forum in response to a specific case submitted by a member and reflects the discussion at that forum. This advice is not necessarily applicable to other cases, as stated on COPE’s website”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, this did not seem to be a very helpful response. Sadly, however, when COPE replied it simply echoed the journal editor. “The intention behind posting Forum case discussions is to provide a guide on how to manage a similar case, but we do note that advice on a specific case may not necessarily be applicable to other, even similar, cases. COPE attempts to reflect all of the discussion of that case when we post Forum case discussions online which, quite often, present and explore opposing opinions and viewpoints. We’d advise anyone reflecting on records of cases discussed at COPE Forum to consider all the points of discussion noted to see whether it is applicable to their own case.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Personally, I could see no difference between the situation I had contacted COPE about and the situation described in the case study, but it is possible I am not privy to all the facts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I responded by asking to be pointed to COPE’s advice to editors and publishers on how to deal with situations like the one discussed in the case study. To this COPE replied, “COPE is a founding partner and active participant of the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkchecksubmit.org/&quot;&gt;Think.Check.Submit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; campaign and we actively support and promote that initiative when responding to the conversation around predatory publishing.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, that did not answer my question. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPE also sent me a copy of a report it had published and helpfully highlighted for me areas in the report that discussed predatory publishing. Again, however, this was a discussion of the issues of predatory publishing, not practical advice to editors and publishers on what to do when a victim approaches them looking for a legitimate home for their paper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What continues to puzzle me,” I replied, “is that COPE appears to have no published policy or advice for editors or journals on what to do when a researcher finds him/herself in the position outlined in your case study (which you say is not advice). I am sure the Think. Check. Submit idea is a good one, but it is of no use whatsoever for researchers who have been (for whatever reason) entrapped by a predatory publisher.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I added, “Does COPE really not intend to publish specific advice on what editors/ journals/ publishers should do in this situation, which I know is very common because many authors contact me who find themselves in it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also copied the journal editor into the email and informed him that I had been in contact with the predatory publisher, who said he was going to take down the paper from his site. Would the editor be willing to reconsider the paper once it had been taken down?, I asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Beginning the dialogue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The editor replied, “I am unable to discuss individual manuscripts with anyone who is not an author on the manuscript, therefore I cannot comment on the specifics of this case. However, in light of this information, we will be reaching out to the authors to investigate further.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shortly afterwards, the author who had asked for my help emailed me to say that the publisher had agreed to reconsider a revised submission of his paper “on a semi-urgent basis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Separately, COPE emailed me to say, “COPE recently held its biannual meeting where this issue was raised and discussed further. It has been agreed to consider what advice COPE can provide in these circumstances and we are beginning the dialogue with our members to decide how best to approach the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is hard not to feel that such a dialogue should have begun long ago, but better late than never perhaps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With luck, COPE will eventually fashion a solution, or at least &lt;i&gt;publish some advice&lt;/i&gt; for editors and journals, if only to encourage them to treat the victims of predatory publishing with more sympathy than they currently experience.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From a selfish point of view, it would certainly be useful if every time a researcher contacted me for assistance and/or advice I could point them to the COPE web site for the help they need. If nothing else this could avoid my having to spend my time emailing publishers on behalf of individuals whom (so far as I can see) no one else currently seems willing to help. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A community solution would also be timely as I am finding it increasingly difficult to get the attention of predatory publishers – I assume because they are having to put more and more effort into handling complaints from their victims!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What frustrates me is that people are happy to rail against predatory publishers, to argue over whether blacklists or whitelists are preferable, or to dismiss predatory publishing as no more than an anti-OA slur, but they continue to insist that the victims are the authors of their own fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, my view is that the wider research community should not be leaving these people hanging in the wind but helping them. After all, it is a wind that the community set in motion the day it embraced and promoted pay-to-publish gold OA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also find it somewhat high-minded and hypocritical for publishers to parrot &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;Think.Check.Submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; every time the topic of predatory publishing comes up. How many researchers know about this initiative? Of those who do, how many can say that using it prevented them from being stung, or that its advice is as useful as claimed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting, for instance, that the Think.Check.Submit site says that one sign of a journal’s legitimacy is if it is “indexed in services that you use”. As I noted, one of the journals I was approached about recently is listed in PubMed. Indeed, it would appear that other predatory journals are still listed in PubMed too, as may be the case with DOAJ (despite it having &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/open-access-index-delists-thousands-of-journals-1.19871&quot;&gt;delisted thousands of predatory journals from its service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2016). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As further evidence of how difficult it is to navigate the world of predatory publishing, we could note that the University Grants Commission (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ugc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;UGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in India has &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journosdiary.com/2017/09/05/india-ugc-white-list-predatory-journals/&quot;&gt;struggled to weed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predatory journals from its whitelist of approved journals.

As such, it is a half-solution at best. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clearly more needs to be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The COPE case study suggests one possible way forward. However, its solution requires more work than should surely be necessary. More importantly, it requires the co-operation of the scammers, making it a morally suspect solution, and a somewhat fragile one at that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surely there is a better way? I think so. Earlier this year, for instance, it was &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AJOLinfo/status/1001751743099785216?s=19&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Twitter that papers captured by predatory journals “could be published a second time in [a] legitimate journal once [a] scam [has been] proven, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crossref.org/&quot;&gt;CrossRef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could consider changing the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doi.org/&quot;&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the legit later one.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The appeal of this approach is that there would be no need to go through the time-consuming and painful process of persuading predatory publishers to take down papers, or in fact to engage with them at all. As I understand it, the idea is that an appeal would be made to, say, CrossRef or COPE, and if that appeal was successful the paper could be republished in a legitimate journal, at which point the article DOI would be re-assigned to the version published in the latter version. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Such a solution would be another timely development since both the research community and publishers are currently grappling with the issue of versioning in the online environment, particularly as the preprint movement gathers pace (see &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/biorxiv-a-postprint-server-944359ac65d4&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for instance, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/the-preprint-dilemma-good-for-science-bad-for-the-public-a-discussion-paper-for-the-scientific-community&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The point is that there is only ever one “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;version of record&lt;/span&gt;” (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/questions/article-versions/&quot;&gt;VoR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and (as I understand it) this is signalled by means of its DOI. In the case of predatory publishing, therefore, presumably the DOI could (as suggested on Twitter) be re-assigned to the VoR and the predatory publisher’s version left to fester. Perhaps the DOI assigned to the predatory version could even be deactivated or turned off in some way, leaving it to wallow in relative obscurity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I am no expert in these matters and no doubt more thought would need to be given to the matter by wiser heads than mine. Either way, the DOI, CrossRef and COPE would seem to me to be essential partners in any solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let us hope that COPE will indeed take this forward and finally begin to offer hope to those isolated and lonely individuals who discover they have been conned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These people are the collateral damage of the pay-to-publish business model devised and promulgated by influential publishers like PLOS and BMC and subsequently endorsed and promoted by the research community. It’s time for the community to hold out a helping hand to the victims of predatory pubishing. If it cannot do this I do not think it can justifiably call itself a community any longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Unconventional Connections: How Inhibition Hones Cortical Selectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11076</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/unconventional-connections-how-inhibition-hones-cortical-selectivity/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience discover a fundamentally new role for inhibition in the visual cortex, refining how neurons encode object motion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains do a remarkable job of encoding visual information about the world around us, providing an almost instantaneous report about rapidly changing conditions that is critical for guiding our behavior. Integral to the brain’s encoding mechanism is the presence of neurons that respond selectively to specific visual features, generating electrical activity that reliably signals properties such as the orientation of edges, their position in space, and their direction of motion. By using new tools to probe the principles of connectivity that neural circuits use to generate selective responses, scientists at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience are gaining a host of new insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural circuits build response selectivity poses an enormous challenge since a single neuron receives thousands of synaptic inputs derived from other neurons and these inputs can differ in their response properties and how they can affect the neuron. Some inputs are excitatory, making the neuron more likely to generate an electrical signal, while others are inhibitory, reducing the likelihood that the neuron generates a signal. Somehow a neuron integrates all of these excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to generate responses that are selective, a mysterious ‘input/output transform’ that has been the subject of intense research interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that there are some simple rules that govern excitatory and inhibitory functional connections. A prominent rule that has emerged for excitatory connections is the notion “like connects with like.” For example, in the visual cortex, neurons that respond selectively to a particular direction of motion are thought to receive their excitatory inputs from other neurons that respond selectively to the same direction of motion. An equally important rule has been postulated for inhibitory inputs: the idea that the properties of the inhibitory inputs a neuron receives match the properties of its excitatory inputs. Because of the “matching rule”, inhibitory inputs are thought to adjust the strength of the excitatory inputs, but not to alter the selectivity conveyed to the neuron by its excitatory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 510px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Figure-1-final.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Figure-1-final.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Cartoon model of co-tuning (top) and differential tuning (bottom) of excitation (G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and inhibition (G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) for direction. Subthreshold direction selectivity is inherited from synaptic conductances when co-tuned. Differential tuning of excitation and inhibition can preferentially suppress excitation and enhance subthreshold selectivity. With differential tuning, inhibition can be either bidirectional or oppositely tunned for direction relative to excitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a recent publication in Nature, researchers in David Fitzpatrick’s Lab, Daniel Wilson, Ph.D., and Benjamin Scholl, Ph.D., have accumulated multiple lines of evidence that challenge both of these principles, providing a new perspective on how circuits in visual cortex employ excitation and inhibition to generate neuronal responses that are selective for an object’s direction of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPFI researchers first needed a better picture of the direction selectivity supplied by a neuron’s excitatory synaptic inputs. To do this they used in vivo two-photon microscopy to characterize the direction selectivity of individual excitatory synaptic inputs onto the dendrites of a neuron, comparing this with the neuron’s overall direction preference. Surprisingly, what they discovered goes against the grain of traditional thinking. Although, many of the synapses aligned with the overall directional preference of the neuron, a large number were found to respond best to the opposite (null) direction of motion, a pattern of connectivity that contrasts sharply with “like connects with like” rule. They also noticed a conspicuous mismatch between the strength of a neuron’s direction selectivity, and that predicted by its excitatory synaptic inputs. The degree of direction selectivity that the neurons exhibited was significantly greater than what would have been expected from such a broad range of excitatory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further probe the factor(s) responsible for this puzzling difference between the neuron’s excitatory inputs and its output, they turned to a different set of experiments using in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. This technique makes it possible to measure the total sum of synaptic inputs contributing to a neuron’s response and to compare the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. The results for the excitatory inputs were consistent with the two-photon imaging data confirming a significant amount of excitatory input for both the preferred and the null direction of motion. The results for inhibition provided the team with another challenge to traditional thinking and a potential explanation for the puzzling input/output difference: In fact, the tuning of the inhibitory inputs did not match the excitatory inputs. For many neurons the strength of inhibition was greatest for the null direction of motion, suggesting that excitatory synaptic inputs to the null direction were being selectively dampened through inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings predict that cortical inhibitory neurons make a substantial number of synaptic inputs to excitatory neurons that prefer the opposite direction of motion. The researchers applied two novel approaches to examine this question, first charting the anatomical connections of functionally defined inhibitory neurons, and then using optogenetics (selectively activating inhibitory neurons with light) to map the source of inhibitory inputs to single excitatory neurons. In tandem, these techniques confirmed that inhibitory connections to excitatory neurons often originated from neurons that preferred the opposite direction of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond disentangling the mechanism responsible for direction selectivity, these discoveries emphasize the flexible ways in which neural circuits can integrate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to build the variety of selective response properties critical for neural coding. Like doesn’t always connect with like and excitation doesn’t always match inhibition, but you can count on brain circuits to have evolved the combination of inputs necessary to ensure high levels of functional performance.&lt;/p&gt;
