&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has stood in the supermarket aisle trying to remember their shopping list might have wished for a larger brain. But when it comes to memory, bigger isn’t always better. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;published in &lt;i&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that young children whose cerebral cortex is thinner in certain areas also tend to have better working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36374&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of previous brain imaging studies already found that working memory – which we use for remembering and manipulating pieces of information over short timescales – involves a network of brain areas in both the frontal and parietal cortices.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of these studies examined adults and older children, and few researchers have investigated younger children aged 4 to 6. At this age, children’s working memory usually improves drastically, so it’s important to understand what is going on in the brain, especially if this could help children with learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Morgan Botdorf and Tracy Riggins from the University of Maryland scanned the brains of 189 healthy children with no known learning difficulties aged between 4 and 8. An impressive 186 of the children remained still enough during the scan to provide usable data.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate session outside of the MRI scanner, the researchers also assessed the kids’ working memory using the forward digit span task, which measures how many digits a child can hold in their memory.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botdorf and Riggins then looked at how performance on this test was related to the thickness of four brain areas known to be important in working memory: the superior frontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. They found that in all four regions, children with &lt;i&gt;thinner&lt;/i&gt; grey matter tended to be able to hold more numbers in memory – they had what psychologists call “a higher digit span”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this result might seem counter-intuitive, it is not completely unexpected that a thinner cortex in these areas is related to better memory. During development, connections between neurons are “pruned”, restructuring and streamlining the brain in a way that is thought to improve memory and cognition, and the study authors suggest that this process is taking place in their participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether these key brain regions were thinner in the older children – and if so, whether this could help explain why older children generally have better working memory. One region did seem to be involved in the effects of aging on working memory: older children had a thinner anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn was related to having a higher digit span. The researchers suggest that in young children, the anterior cingulate cortex “may be developing particularly rapidly” and so have an important role in the cognitive changes that occur in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from age, a number of other factors could influence the thickness of cortical areas. Previous research has implicated genetics and lifestyle factors like vitamin consumption and stress, for example, though the researchers note that the evidence for these is often sketchy. “A ripe avenue for future research would be to focus on identifying specific factors that impact the structure of the cortex, particularly during early childhood,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of what causes cortical thinning, researchers could begin to figure out how to intervene to facilitate these changes and improve working memory in children at risk of memory impairments. This is an important consideration as working memory is strongly related to educational achievement at school, and so the new study is a step in the right direction.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the new research is that it only looked at children’s ability to store verbal information, not other important functions of working memory, such as remembering visual information. It remains to be seen whether these other aspects of memory are also related to the thickness of young children’s grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;When less is more: Thinner fronto-parietal cortices are associated with better forward digit span performance during early childhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Fotolia_79987031_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10813&quot; style=&quot;width: 1010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10813&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Fotolia_79987031_Subscription_Yearly_XXL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;BMI (body mass index) is used to determine whether a person is a healthy body weight. But it has flaws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;© Sherry Young / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I remember, people told me to always exercise and eat well to stay fit and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts in both the public and private sector to promote the consumption of healthier foods and motivate people to be more physically active, obesity remains a major concern worldwide. There are currently about 2 billion people overweight, of which 650 million are obese, indicating that obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight&quot;&gt;WHO, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being overweight or obese is highly discouraged, as it is a major risk factor of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and heart failure amongst many other pathologies. Obesity would also have an immediate impact on your mental health and amount to a reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know that obesity is also a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, at the GUTS laboratory we wanted to investigate the impact of obesity and body composition on survival after cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you measure obesity and body composition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are generally considered obese when they have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30. You can calculate your own BMI by dividing your weight in kg by the square of your height in meters (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A healthy BMI should be between 20-24.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. People with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem with BMI scales is that they do not distinguish between fat and muscle mass and do not accurately reflect the lipid content and inflammation occurring in the fat tissue. People with a high muscle mass and low fat mass, a condition often linked to a healthy lifestyle, may therefore have the same BMI as people with almost no muscle but with a high amount of fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10811&quot; style=&quot;width: 871px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10811&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;861&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image provided by authors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, some other techniques are currently available that give a much better estimation of your body composition including computed tomography (CT)-scans. CT-scans can not only provide you with information on the amount of whole-body fat and muscle mass, but they can also give you some qualitative information on your body tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the influence of BMI and body composition on survival in cancer patients, we performed detailed body composition analyses on CT scans of 217 patients with advanced colorectal cancer that do not respond to chemotherapy. Much to our surprise, we found that in this patient population, obese patients had a better survival than non-obese patients. Obesity is a known risk factor for colon cancer incidence, so why would it be beneficial in our study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation could be a different role of obesity depending on the stage of the disease.  Where the adverse metabolic and inflammatory status linked to obesity takes precedence in the acquisition of colorectal cancer and the early stages of the disease, a larger amount of energy stored in your fat tissue becomes increasingly important and beneficial in an advanced stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is also supported by our more detailed body composition data showing that not only a high amount of muscle mass but also fat mass is beneficial in a late stage of the disease. We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival. Whether the prognostic impact of adipose tissue density in our study is mediated by malnutrition, the role of inflammation, and/or an altered function of the fat cells, is currently being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our study shows that beyond the analysis of specific tumor mutations, which is often the only element used for personalized treatment, we should also take into account the physical state and the patient’s body composition in patient’s treatment decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: What is the most effective intervention for ensuring weight recording in pregnancy?</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-641963334-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why focus on healthy weight gain in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gestational weight gain (GWG) outside of guidelines is linked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586887&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative health consequences&lt;/a&gt; for both the mother and her baby. Pregnant women who gain weight in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32813/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, also adopted for use in Australia (where we did our study), have the lowest risk of pregnancy and birth-related complications. Women who gain more are more likely to experience high blood pressure and diabetes in pregnancy, longer hospital stays after birth, and Cesarean sections. They are also more likely to have trouble losing weight after the baby is born and to have difficulty breastfeeding. Women who do not gain enough weight are more likely to deliver their baby early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less than a third of pregnant women gain the right amount.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of over 1 million pregnant women, linked above, 47% had GWG greater than and 23% had GWG less than IOM recommendations. With the service changes made in our hospital’s antenatal care processes, we have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1747-0080.12475&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document significant reduction in excess GWG&lt;/a&gt; (decreasing from 57.3% to 32.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we support women’s healthy weight gain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10803&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10803&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-494561744-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Stethoscope with financial statement [credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;In pregnancy, weighing as a stand-alone intervention does not reduce excessive GWG. However, approaches that include dietary advice and physical activity, supported by ongoing weight monitoring, can prevent excessive GWG. Routine weighing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13790&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acceptable&lt;/a&gt; to women and has not been shown to increase anxiety or distress. It is also a valuable opportunity to act and counsel women to support a healthy pregnancy. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13511&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many services do not regularly weigh pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, often due to historical routines and beliefs .&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you build it (properly), they will come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut instinct says that if you tell people what to do they will do it – disseminate guidelines, deliver training, display posters – but evidence shows otherwise. Just as telling someone they need to exercise regularly for good health rarely results in a long-term change in routine, similarly, a more nuanced and tailored approach is required to facilitate sustainable changes in healthcare delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-1-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Implementation Science&lt;/a&gt; – the field of scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine care. The approach we took in our large tertiary maternity service follows the recommended steps to develop effective health care interventions. In this case, we wanted behaviors of health professionals, teams, and the organization to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who needs to do what, differently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What barriers and enablers need to be addressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which intervention components (behavior change techniques and modes of delivery) could help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can behavior change be measured and understood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a body of work that synthesized data from the literature, clinical observations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-13-117&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216325&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;surveys &lt;/a&gt;(i.e. theory, evidence, and practical issues), we followed this four-step approach to select the most appropriate components of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mcn.12266&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our implementation intervention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements of a system-wide intervention to improve GWG guideline adherence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10804&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10804&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/IMG_2774-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early steps in our work resulted in a number of service and system changes, informed by our use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-38&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theoretical domains framework&lt;/a&gt; (TDF). This allowed us to sort and categorize the barriers we faced to achieving best GWG practice. The domains from the TDF relevant to our maternity service included: &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Skills&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Social and professional role/identity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Beliefs about capabilities&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Environmental context and resources.&lt;/em&gt; This led to us increasing dietitian time in clinic (including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-131&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dietitian-led early antenatal workshop&lt;/a&gt;), development of GWG resources for maternity staff to use (including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellness.mater.org.au/Our-Services/Nutrition-and-Dietetics/Outpatients/The-Mater-Personalised-Pregnancy-Weight-Tracker-©&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weight tracker&lt;/a&gt;), and staff training around GWG. Our changes were small but targeted – made within service capacity and with reorientation of existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed better compliance with individual guideline elements but overall adherence did not improve. The focus of this research related to the same identified gaps, and strategies were implemented in stages including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staff in-services training outlining and incorporating the evidence into practice via voiceover PowerPoint presentation (2014),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obtaining scales for each antenatal clinic room (2014), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removal of a default ‘skip’ option from the e-health record where weight is recorded, to promote mandatory entries (September 2016).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is more effective for ensuring weight recording in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2162-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; assessed the cumulative influence of these interventions on staff’s compliance to recording of antenatal weights. Using routinely collected data across the same periods of our interventions allowed us to easily compare staff’s documentation of women’s weights at antenatal visits to measure how each intervention affected practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three 15-month cohorts (from April 2014 to December 2017), there were approximately 39,000 pregnancies. The proportion of women who had a weight recorded at each visit per cohort differed significantly between cohorts, from 4.2% (baseline) to 18.9% (scales and in-services) to 61.8% (medical record prompts) (p &amp;lt;0.001). Improvements were observed across the entire service, in all models of care and with all professional groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think global, act local.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance on memory to follow recommended practices from guidelines less-consistently elicits behavior change compared to routine structural changes to facilitate their implementation. Our interventions showed greater improvements than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001096.pub2/full&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously documented for reminder systems&lt;/a&gt; (usually only ~4%), perhaps through being uniquely tailored to the local barriers. Simple system changes appear to be most effective for sustainable outcomes in this instance of antenatal weight recording. This reflects findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publish.csiro.au/AH/AH17255&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent eHealth review&lt;/a&gt; that highlighted substantial improvements in accuracy and completeness of clinical information as well as guideline adherence when electronic medical records are integrated into workflow processes (used at the point of care). Future guideline implementation projects should look beyond education sessions to harnessing systems and technology which will support their desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5822 size-large&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-old-lady-3503684_1920-1024x683.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Cholesterol Can Positively Impact Women’s Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics bear out the folk wisdom that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1018115&quot;&gt;women live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;. However, living longer doesn’t necessarily equate to living better. All too often, dementia robs older women of what could be the happiest time of their lives. And while medical science continues to try to solve the problem of dementia, to date, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease represents approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dementia.org.au/about-dementia/types-of-dementia/alzheimers-disease&quot;&gt;60-80% of all dementia cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it is just one of approximately 50 known causes of dementia. Yet, we’ve hardly even scratched the surface on treating Alzheimer’s, let alone those many other lesser-known causes. Nearly two-thirds of those suffering from dementia are women, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/how-good-cholesterol-can-keep-women-s-brains-healthy&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; have only performed a handful of studies to study how the disease progresses in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, two&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9887-z&quot;&gt; recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9970-5&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/medicine-and-radiology-research/royal-melbourne-hospital/healthy-ageing-program/womens-healthy-ageing-project&quot;&gt;Women’s Healthy Ageing Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne are now bringing to light not only how dementia develops in women, but also how women can delay or prevent it. Much of the research points to two systems of the body — the cardiovascular (heart) and nervous systems (brain) — and how they work in tandem to either slow down or speed up the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grey and White Matter and Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of brain matter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18117.htm&quot;&gt;white matter and grey matter. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered the amount of grey matter a woman has at age 60 can serve as a reliable predictor of her memory ability at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that one sure sign of dementia in older adults is a decrease in grey matter volume. What’s new about the research at the University of Melbourne, however, is how to potentially &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; this decline in grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the cardiovascular comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains require a lot of blood, and proper circulation is critical to ensuring our brains receive not only the rich oxygen blood provides but also valuable nutrients and fats the brain needs to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Role Does Cholesterol Play in Brain Health?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple rule when it comes to heart health and brain health is:  ‘what’s good for your heart is good for your brain’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia Australia recommends five steps to reduce your risk of dementia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainmatters.org.au/5-simple-steps/step-1-look-after-your-heart&quot;&gt;‘Look after your heart’&lt;/a&gt; is rule number one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bad:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When women develop a high level of LDL, or ‘bad’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides&quot;&gt;cholesterol,&lt;/a&gt; it clog blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the brain. Starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients causes grey matter mass to decline. White matter also sustains damage from lack of adequate blood flow, meaning the different parts of the brain no longer “talk” to each other the way they previously did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, predictably, is a drastic decline in cognitive function, including the ability to remember learned information and the ability to form new memories. When allowed to continue unchecked, dementia develops at a much faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The good:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, women with normal levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol, called HDL which carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver showed less &lt;em&gt;white matter&lt;/em&gt; damage in their brain a decade later when they conducted late-life brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women’s Healthy Ageing Project researchers point out that maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol impacts on the structure of the brain directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk of developing dementia, or to stave it off as long as possible, it’s critical to talk to your doctor about getting your cholesterol under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest strategies to target major cardiovascular risk factors at midlife might also be effective in reducing the development of brain lesions and late life cognitive decline,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says Professor Szoeke, one of the lead researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And while our findings relate to women, we know healthy lifestyles are important for men to maintain their brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, and the art of feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HzbzdAVc7_sjhnhsEzUu-Q.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep success story of modern neuroscience is the theory that dopamine neurons signal a prediction error, the error between what reward you expected and what you got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its success runs deep. It has been supported by converging evidence from the firing of neurons, the release of dopamine, and the blood-flow seen in fMRI. That evidence has been gathered across diverse species, from humans, monkeys, rats, and bees. There is even causal evidence that forcing dopamine neurons to fire sends error signals in the brain, effects we can see in the behaviour of the animals whose dopamine neurons are being toyed with. The theory bridges data from the scale of human behaviour down to the level of single neurons. Unlike many theories for the brain, this one is properly computational, and makes multiple, non-trivial predictions that have turned out to be true. Dopamine and errors in predictions are intimately intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this intimate link raises a bigger but rarely articulated question. It’s perfectly possible to build a brain that learns from errors without any explicit representation of that error in the brain. So why does the brain have an error signal for rewards at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand that question, first we need to know a little about the prediction error theory itself. The theory says that dopamine neurons fire to unexpectedly good things. If I suddenly tap you on the shoulder and hand you a sweet, your dopamine neurons go ping! for the sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I keep tapping you on the shoulder, and keep giving you a sweet, your dopamine neurons stop going ping for the sweet — getting a sweet is great but it is no longer unexpected (and frankly you’d rather I respected your personal space a bit more). Instead, the dopamine neurons go ping! for the tap itself. This is the clever bit: the neuron goes ping! because the tap on the shoulder now reliably predicts a sweet is coming (a good thing), but it’s unexpected because you don’t know when the tap is coming — so the tap on the shoulder becomes the unexpectedly good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory also says that dopamine neurons, like people, are deeply upset by their routines being violated. Having established this relationship of trust — me repeatedly tapping you on the shoulder and you at least getting a series of sweets out of this violation of social norms — what happens if I tap you on the shoulder and then don’t give you a sweet? Your dopamine neurons then shut down completely, stop firing at all for a brief period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, dopamine neurons send a rapid signal that covers all three possible errors in predicting a reward: that the reward was better than expected (a positive error); that the reward was exactly as expected (no error); or that the reward was less than expected (a negative error). We can label all this using one of those torturous compound nouns beloved of scientists: dopamine neurons send a reward prediction error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This correspondence between dopamine and “reward prediction error” has its roots in the branch of AI called reinforcement learning (well, technically, it’s a branch of machine learning, but as everything is now labelled AI, including a FitBit which I’m pretty sure is just an accelerometer with a strap, then AI it is). Reinforcement learning is the accumulation of algorithms for how something can learn from being told only how wrong or right its own predictions were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the classic algorithms of reinforcement learning have an explicit signal for the error in predicting how valuable a choice will be (where the roll call of algorithms include bandits, Temporal Difference learning, Q learning, SARSA, or Actor-Critic). This is the signal between the predicted value of what happens next, and the actual value of what happens next — where value is measured by the expected amount of future reward. The magic of reinforcement learning is that by simply minimising this error between the predicted and actual value of each next thing in the world, an artificial agent can learn remarkably complex sequences of events, like navigating across a world, or how to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is the computational part of the dopamine theory: that the rapid responses of dopamine neurons just are the prediction error of reinforcement learning algorithms. That they are the error between the predicted and actual value of what happens next. And that they are used to learn. The key to this theory is not just that the dopamine neurons signal the difference between what reward you got and what you expected. It is that they also transfer that signal to unexpected things that predict reward, exactly as reinforcement learning algorithms say they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that dopamine neuron are only encoding this prediction error. There are many nuances to what dopamine neurons themselves may be interested in, a super-set of things beyond prediction errors. And indeed errors in predicting reward are but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817301587?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;a sub-set of the possible errors in predictions about the world&lt;/a&gt; that could exist in the brain (a story for next time). But that dopamine neurons encode an error in predicting reward seems a well-established part of what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And this proposed correspondence between the rapid response of dopamine neurons and a prediction error is true of more elaborate reinforcement learning algorithms too, such as the exciting revival and extension of Peter Dayan’s “successor representation” idea by Sam Gershman, Ida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8#auth-1&quot;&gt;Momennejad&lt;/a&gt;, Kim Stachenfeld and colleagues. In the successor representation account, there is not one simple error between what you predicted and what you got, but a whole vector of errors about predictions for changes to different features of the world — one of which is reward. &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1645&quot;&gt;A recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from Gershman and colleagues shows how thinking of the rapid dopamine neuron response as the sum of those errors can explain some perplexing recent findings about dopamine neurons sending rapid signals to changes in the world that aren’t reward.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was no need for this correspondence twixt neuron and theoretical error signal to exist. The algorithms of reinforcement learning are based on observations of animal behaviour. And they can be very successful: animals, including humans, often really do behave like they are using a prediction error in reward to learn about the world. But just because we can describe behaviour using an error in prediction about reward, it does not follow that there has to be such an explicit error signal in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For it is perfectly possible to construct a system that learns about the world using feedback that does not have an explicit signal for the error in its predictions. One example of these systems is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000049&quot;&gt;a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt;, one that learns about the probabilities of things in the future, rather than certainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1560&quot;&gt;Such a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt; might represent the uncertainty about what the value of taking action A will be. This uncertainty will encoded by a probability distribution — which we might write P(value|action A) — for the possible values of taking action A. For example, there might be a high probability that taking action A will have a low value, and a low probability it will have a high value; or vice-versa; or something far more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We plonk our poor Bayesian agent in the dullest world imaginable. Its entire life consists of choosing which of three levers it should pull in order to win a coin, over and over again. As the chances of winning a coin are different between the three levers, so the agent has to work out which to pull in order to get the most coins in the long run. Three levers, so three possible actions, so three corresponding probability distributions for the value of each lever. Each round the agent picks a lever based on those probability distributions — perhaps it tends to pick the one which currently gives the highest probability of the largest reward — and watches for the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coin or not, the agent uses the outcome to update its probability distribution. A coin is evidence that the lever is good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a high value; no coin is evidence that the lever is no good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a low value. Either way, the agent now has more information about the action it chose, regardless of whether it was a good outcome or a bad outcome. The probability distribution for that action is updated to reflect that information by changing the parameters of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no error signal. The agent is learning from feedback about the world, and can use its learning to make decisions, but has no prediction error signal. Sure, we could construct one — by computing the difference between the probability distributions before and after the coin arrived — but we don’t need one. The error signal is implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is behaviour, not yet the brain. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2004.10.007&quot;&gt;many believe&lt;/a&gt; the brain represents the world using probability distributions; and there are plausible theories for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3495&quot;&gt;how to represent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.01.003&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; probability distributions using neurons. These boil down adjusting the firing of the population of neurons representing a probability distribution. And you do that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004485&quot;&gt;by adjusting the strengths of the inputs&lt;/a&gt; to those neurons (whether those inputs be from within the population or outside it). So the brain just needs a signal about whether or not a reward occurred, and use that to adjust connections. No complicated signal about the error in predictions is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a brain could learn from reinforcement with or without an explicit signal for errors in predicting that reinforcement. But the brain does have an explicit error signal encoded by dopamine neurons. What does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it tells us three interesting ideas for how the brain works. I think — fully prepared to be wrong about this, and for there to be a water-tight argument for why you can’t build a brain without an explicit signal for errors in predicting reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first idea is that the existence of an explicit error signal implies the existence of a simple representation of the world in the brain. A so-named “model-free” representation that does not represent every possible outcome of an action, and likely does not use probability either. A quickly accessible look-up table of the values of actions, that is used to choose actions when time is pressing or the world is unchanging. We already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2011.02.009&quot;&gt;some good ideas&lt;/a&gt; of where such representations live in the brain. And all forms of such simple representations we know about require an explicit signal for the error between actual and predicted values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second idea is that what is one concept in reinforcement learning is actually two processes in the brain. The one concept in reinforcement learning is that you use the error in your prediction to change your estimate of an action’s value. Why is this two processes in the brain? Because the brain might want to separately control short-term and long-term changes in the estimates of an action’s value. And having an explicit error signal carried by dopamine lets it do both with one signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get long-term changes we could adjust our estimate of an action’s value by changing up or down the strength of connections onto neurons representing that action. Adjusting our estimate of value in this way changes long-term behaviour. And the rapid dopamine signal is indeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002034&quot;&gt;thought to control&lt;/a&gt; whether and in which direction some connections in the brain are allowed to change their strengths. Here you need the sign of the error signal to tell the connections which direction to change in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the brain doesn’t necessarily want each and every bit of feedback it gets to change a connection between neurons. For that locks it into a path from which it might be difficult to recover. Indeed, when we try and change the strengths of these connections ourselves, by stimulating the inputs to a neuron, some of them can prove remarkably difficult to shift. Which raises the possibility that, in the short-term, the brain may want to hedge its bets, by changing its estimates of an action’s value without changing any connection strengths. And it can do this by instead changing how responsive neurons are to their inputs. If you make the neuron for action A more likely to fire, then you’ve increased its predicted value; and vice-versa. Guess which transmitter in the brain has many hundreds of papers showing it changes the responsiveness of neurons that control action? Yep, dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, the argument here is that the explicit error signal exists to allow the brain to control changes of predicted value on two time-scales. And do that using one error signal coded by dopamine: to both allow changing connection strengths in the long-term, and change how responsive neurons are in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third idea is that an explicit error signal in the brain is evolutionary happenstance. Building a system to learn from feedback is easier with an explicit error signal than with representations of probabilities across a group of neurons. Ancient animals likely had a neuron or two that spritzes dopamine, or something similar, as part of their control of movement. We can find plenty of invertebrates with a just a few thousand neurons in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0136-08.2008&quot;&gt;dopamine alters movement &lt;/a&gt;by changing the ways neurons respond to their inputs. With this dopamine system in place, perhaps the path of least resistance for evolution was to co-opt this broadcast signal to change the coupling between neurons following an error. Which seems potentially easier than, from the same crude beginnings, first evolving a distributed system for representing information that does not require an explicit error signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributions of theory to neuroscience are as much about showing what the brain doesn’t or can’t do, as what it can do. Yes, if we allow any arbitrary idea, this space is practically infinite: theories showing that the brain doesn’t use strawberry jelly as a neurotransmitter, or doesn’t compute using the back of an envelope and a blunt pencil are not useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here we find an explicit error signal in the brain, and that rules out a whole class of ways of doing learning from feedback, and rules some in. The reward prediction error theory of dopamine tells us as much by what it doesn’t do, as what does. In the garden of forking paths, we should be glad of some help — and few garden paths are more forking complicated than the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are few subjects where a larger gap exists between public opinion and expert opinion than people’s opinions on foods, like corn or wheat, that have been genetically manipulated to, for example, increase crop yields or bolster pest-resistance. Experts generally view so-called GM foods as totally safe to consume, while the public is suspicious of them — and this divide is massive. One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/11/amid-debate-over-labeling-gm-foods-most-americans-believe-theyre-unsafe/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; found that just 37 per cent of the American public believed GM foods are safe to eat, compared with 88 per cent of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (public attitudes are similarly negative in the UK, with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/02/21/many-britain-remain-sceptical-gm-foods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2014 poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; finding that 40 per cent of adults felt the government should not promote GM foods, compared with 22 per cent in favour, and the rest unsure). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unlike some subjects where this divide between layperson and expert opinion is heavily mediated by politics, such as climate change caused by human activity — in the U.S. and elsewhere, conservatives are far less likely to believe in it than are liberals and climate scientists — the GM-food divide doesn’t really have a political dimension: Liberals, centrists, and conservatives are all about equally likely to have what are, from the point of view of experts, unfounded fears about the safety of GM foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To better understand the source of these fears, a team led by Philip M. Fernbach, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, surveyed nationally representative samples in America, Germany and France, and other online participants, about their views on both GM foods and climate change, tested their knowledge on these subjects by asking them to answer factual questions, and also asked them to gauge their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;perceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; level of knowledge on those subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The headline finding from the study, published as a letter in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, is neatly summed up by its title: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3&quot;&gt;“Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; That is, on average, the more vehemently a given respondent said they were opposed to GM foods, the fewer questions about the subject they answered accurately, and the higher they rated their own knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36339&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This can be seen as a subject-specific version of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, or people’s tendency to be ignorant about their own ignorance. The finding held across the samples in different countries (though in France, the zoomed-out finding that supporters of GM foods knew more about the subject than opponents wasn’t statistically significant, as it was elsewhere):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These are dispiriting findings. The people who know the least think they know the most, and suffice it to say some of them are likely taking an active part in spreading overblown fears about GM foods, worsening the problem. (One possible explanation for the results is that people with the strongest opposition to GM foods are concerned about matters unrelated to scientific knowledge, such as being opposed for moral reasons. However, the researchers looked into this and found that “73% of respondents cited food safety/health concerns as their reason for opposition…Extreme opponents were actually more likely to cite food safety/health concerns than moderates and the main results replicate when we restrict analysis to the subset of participants citing food safety/health concerns.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Things get even more interesting upon examining Fernbach et al’s findings with regard to anthropogenic climate change, knowledge, and perceived knowledge. Because there, while the researchers found the same general pattern, it wasn’t statistically significant: “Contrary to GM foods and gene therapy we found no significant effects of knowledge—objective or self-assessed—on extremity of climate change attitudes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Why might that be? The researchers think it’s because climate change has become politicised whereas GM foods have not. “The null effect [for climate change] has been attributed to ‘cultural cognition,’” the authors write, referring to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culturalcognition.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;concept most commonly associated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dan Kahan of Yale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. “When an issue becomes polarized, people’s attitudes reflect affiliation with their ideological group and not individual knowledge. That is, individuals subscribe to whatever their in-group believes, regardless of how much they know about the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moreover, on this and other politicised topics, extreme ideology might sap people’s ability to truly integrate new information, and recognise the merit of counter-arguments, in a manner that nudges their beliefs. While the “traditional view in the public understanding of scientific literature is that public attitudes that run counter to the scientific consensus reflect a knowledge deficit,” in reality this view, itself, appears to be inaccurate, at least when it comes to politically charged issues: As people get more knowledgeable, their beliefs on such controversies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;don’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;necessarily change in the predictable manner one would expect if there were a direct tie between knowledge and belief unmediated by ideology. That might be because strong ideological beliefs cause people to simply filter and interpret new information in a manner which reinforces those beliefs. “Okay, based on this research it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;does &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;look like the planet is warming, but that’s part of a natural cycle that has nothing to do with humans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As Fernbach and his colleagues note at the end of their paper, even for less-politicised issues like GM foods, their findings suggest that improving public awareness of basic scientific consequences might be more complex than previously realised, since those holding onto the most severe forms of misinformation are also least likely to seek out more facts or be open to hearing the other side. “This suggests that a prerequisite to changing people’s views through education may be getting them to first appreciate the gaps in their knowledge.” Which is a whole other task — and a very important one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3&quot;&gt;Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Provides Feedback on the Implementation of Plan S</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8423</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/DZ2jXvoUwQw/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We welcome Plan S as a ‘decisive step towards the realisation of full open access’&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in particular the push it provides towards realization of a research process based on the principles of open science. This is fully aligned with our mission to bring scientists together to share work as rapidly and widely as possible, to advance science faster and to benefit society as a whole. Our publications have operated in line with the core principles outlined in Plan S since the launch of our first journal, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, in 2003. We recognize that wide adoption of support for Plan S may bring additional competition within the open access publishing space. We welcome this evolution as a positive change in research culture, resulting in greater availability of information, growing inclusion in the scientific process and increasing the speed of discovery and innovation.  Below is our response to the call for public feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feedback Questions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Is there anything unclear or are there any issues that have not been addressed by the guidance document?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While welcoming Plan S, its principles and stated intentions, there are some points where we believe additional clarification would be beneficial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A. Changing research assessment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are glad to see emphasis on changing research assessment and commitment to the principles of DORA as part of Plan S. We believe this is critical to enabling change in publication behaviours, allowing the value of research outputs to be assessed on their merits rather than through an aggregated metric based on publication venue. However, we note that although the original publication of Plan S states that members of cOalition S ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;commit to fundamentally revise the incentive and reward system of science, using the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) as a starting point’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the implementation guidance states only that ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;cOAlition S members intend to sign DORA and implement those requirements in their policies.’ We ask cOalition S to provide clarity regarding the steps that will be taken to drive the ‘fundamental change’ indicated in the original publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;B. Transformative agreements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While recognizing the need for a route for subscription journals to transition away from publication behind paywalls, we believe that without stringent guidelines and compliance checks, ‘transformative deals’ may have significant unintended consequences, reducing choice and narrowing the market. As identified by Adam Tickell in his 2015 review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the need for ‘OA policy to offer greater choice to research producers’ remains, and we believe this should be a primary consideration for cOalition S in considering the future shape of the research and innovation market, particularly as it relates to the assessment and communication of research findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘Transformative agreements’ offer advantage to the largest players and to publishers with substantial subscriptions business, as smaller publishers have to ‘wait in line’ to enter negotiations while those, including but not limited to PLOS, without legacy subscription businesses cannot participate. We acknowledge that the intention of cOalition S members is that ‘transformative agreements’ should not decrease the amount of money available in the system to fund publishing in other compliant venues, however, we believe this is the likely outcome as limited institutional and library publication budgets become tied into large ‘read and publish’/’publish and read’ (RAP/PAR) deals. This perpetuates the dominance of the ‘big deal’ in the market, which in its rebranded ‘publish and read’ form, has the potential to become the status quo rather than a step towards transformation, much as hybrid journals have become the status quo in relation to open access. Moreover, the transition of subscription ‘big deals’ into ‘RAP/PAR’ deals risks locking the high cost of subscriptions into an open access future, if deals so far are anything to judge by. We would like to see a ‘clear and time-specified commitment to a full Open Access transition’ as outlined in the implementation guidelines, be a central requirement for all journals covered by a ‘transformative agreement’ in order to be considered compliant with Plan S. We also ask for greater clarity on the allowed start and end dates for these agreements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;C. Deposition in open repositories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While we understand that this is a recommendation rather than a mandatory criterion for compliance with Plan S, we believe that the proposal that there be ‘direct deposition of publications by the publisher into Plan S compliant author designated or centralised Open Access repositories’ has the potential to add cost and complexity to compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Currently, we and many other publishers syndicate our published articles to PMC/Europe PMC. The process of direct deposition to each repository is not without cost, requiring both staff and technical resources to set up and to run. These costs will increase should it become necessary to deposit to a range of ‘author designated’ repositories. This is especially the case given the importance of equitable treatment of publications from researchers in different disciplines and/or geographical regions, particularly as cOalition S grows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We encourage cOalition S to reconsider this recommendation and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;propose deposition in a small number of recognized repositories or dispatch services, to facilitate compliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;D. Publication costs and APC caps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the published guidance, cOalition S calls for ‘full transparency and monitoring of Open Access publication costs and fees’ and indicates the potential for ‘standardisation of fees and/or APC caps’. We understand that the cOalition has revised this position and intends to call for transparency but not to introduce set caps. We welcome this change of approach which we would like to see reflected in the next iteration of the written guidance. We believe that requiring transparency will allow funders, or others paying the costs of publication, to assess the value of their payments while minimizing the opportunity to give rise to unintended consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In considering potential unintended consequences, there is a useful parallel with the introduction of tuition fees at universities in England. Since tuition fees were introduced in 1998, they have been capped by the UK government. According to a House of Commons Library briefing paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, each time that the cap has been raised, almost all English HEIs have increased their fees to the maximum allowed level. When it was announced that the cap would increase to £9,000 from 2012, Lord Willetts, then Minister for Universities and Science, said that the maximum fee would be charged only in ‘exceptional circumstances’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and it was anticipated that this would ‘create a market in fees’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. This market did not emerge and in fact, nearly all HEIs set their fees at the maximum allowed rate. We believe that there is significant potential for an analogous situation to emerge in relation to APCs. Rather than creating a market where publishers set APCs at the lowest level that covers their costs sustainably, it is more likely that caps would encourage APCs to be set at the maximum allowed level even if this is substantially higher than the publisher’s costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Additionally, the cost associated with the publication of an individual article is highly variable dependent on publication venue. The level of editorial activity, including building relationships with, and providing support to, authors, referees and academic editors is a significant contributor to cost but generates substantial value for the research community. The level of selectivity of the journal or platform is also an influencing factor, as more selective publications incur additional costs through assessing articles that do not go on to be published in that venue. While we recognize and support the need to change the measure of selectivity from one focused on journal impact factors, we believe that the ability to differentiate levels of selectivity based on appropriate and meaningful criteria should continue, where selective  journals and platforms can demonstrate their value through community engagement and cost transparency. We believe that this will support a thriving research and innovation ecosystem more effectively than moving to a ‘one size fits all’ approach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Are there other mechanisms or requirements funders should consider to foster full and immediate Open Access of research outputs? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We believe that diversity and equality of opportunity, including for new entrants to the market, should be retained and encouraged to ensure to a thriving and diverse research and innovation ecosystem. Referring to part (B) of our answer to Question 1, we encourage cOalition S to consider this opportunity to move from ‘big deal’-style arrangements as rapidly as possible to avoid further consolidation around the largest players in the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Focusing on regulation of existing business models, both transformative agreements and APCs, may have the unintended consequence of creating barriers to the diversification in the market. We applaud the the support indicated in the implementation guidance for ‘a diversity of models and non-APC based outlets’ and encourage cOalition S to ensure equal emphasis on the development of new business models, alongside consideration of established approaches. We believe this is vital in order to maintain choice for researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling good in an emotional sense helps to foster better physical health – at least that’s what’s been found in studies in the West. But “feeling good” doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing in all cultures. In the US, people tend to report that being excited and experiencing other so-called “high arousal positive (HAP) states” is what makes them feel good. Many people in Japan, however, place greater value on the opposite extreme, viewing calm, quiet “low arousal positive (LAP) states” as more pleasant and desirable. So, does this mean that engaging more often in stimulating activities – like a fitness work-out or a party – will make for better health in US citizens, while for people in Japan, engaging in more calming activities – like taking frequent baths – will have more of a beneficial effect? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-03288-001.pdf&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Emotion&lt;/i&gt;, which explores this question, reveals some clear cultural variations – though not all of them are as the researchers predicted. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36337&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magali Clobert at Stanford University and her colleagues analysed survey data collected at two time points from 640 Americans and 382 Japanese people. The sample from the US was slightly more educated and slightly older than the Japanese, but as the authors note, “both samples come from an industrialized and modern society, are well-educated, and are middle-aged.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the participants’ initial scores on a variety of surveys measuring their experience of HAP and LAP emotional states, as well as how often the participants engaged in behaviours or practices that could feasibly generate these states, such as going to a party, having a good fitness work-out or amusing people (all of which should lead to HAP feelings) and reading, taking a relaxing bath, praying, meditating or seeing beautiful scenery (which should lead to LAP feelings). They also reported on how psychologically and physically well they felt. Clobert and her colleagues then looked at biological data (including blood cholesterol levels, body mass index, and the inflammatory marker IL-6), which had been collected several months later. At this second time point, the participants also gave ratings for aspects of life satisfaction, sleep, subjective physical health, HAP and LAP behaviours, and psychological wellbeing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that HAP feelings predicted better physical health more in the United States than they did in Japan. For example, experiencing more HAP feelings at the first time point predicted both a subsequently lower BMI and lower inflammation in the US – but not in Japan. Engaging in more HAP-related activities also predicted fewer later ill-health symptoms and conditions, fewer sleep problems and less pain in the US – but not in Japan. “Among Japanese, HAP feelings did not predict most of the health outcomes, and this was particularly evident for biological and physical health,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also consistent with the researchers’ predictions, engaging in more LAP-related behaviours was associated with subsequent better health for people in Japan more than in the US – such as fewer sleep problems and less pain. However, against expectations, experiencing more LAP feelings was actually a stronger predictor of better psychological well-being in the US than in Japan (though paradoxically more LAP feelings also marginally predicted greater inflammation in the US participants).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers titled their paper: &lt;i&gt;‘Feeling excited or taking a bath: do distinct pathways underlie the positive affect-health link in the US and Japan?&lt;/i&gt;’ As they themselves note, their work suggests that the answer is “a partial ‘yes’” – the findings suggest that cultural attitudes to what is and is not a desirable emotional state, and related behaviours, can influence health, and deserve more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clobert and her colleagues conclude, “Positive feelings may be more beneficial to health in cultural contexts that value those states, especially for feeling HAP states. By comparing cultures that differ systematically in terms of how they understand, value, and construe emotion, we may be able to determine why positive affect is so important for health in many U.S. settings, and determine to what extent positive affect matters for physical, biological, and mental functioning in other settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000531&quot;&gt;Feeling excited or taking a bath: Do distinct pathways underlie the positive affect–health link in the U.S. and Japan?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurately or not we are able to judge the size of our own bodies and specific body parts is an important topic in clinical psychology because a distorted body image is thought to play part in eating disorders, body dysmorphia and other related conditions. However, research has until now been limited in always involving one- or two-dimensional judgments, with volunteers asked to estimated the length of various body parts, for instance, or asked to judge which of various 2-dimensional visual depictions of their body is most accurate. In reality, of course, we don’t just have a sense of how our body looks in two dimensions from the outside but also how it feels from the inside, including how much space it occupies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218303496?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; is the first to examine how accurately people of healthy weight can estimate the volume of their entire body and specific body parts. Renata Sadibolova at Goldsmiths, University of London, and her colleagues write that “these findings … highlight the importance of studying the perceptual distortions ‘at the baseline’, i.e., in healthy population, given their potential to further elucidate the nature of perceptual distortions in clinical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36307&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 40 young men and women (average BMI 24) and asked them to wear a black smock to cover their bodies and to sit at a table. Here they were challenged to judge their bodies in one of two different ways. Half the participants made judgments of the length and volume of various parts of their body based on using their sense of the length and volume of their hand, such as estimating how many hand-lengths is their foot, their head, right arm, right leg, and entire body; and how many times could their hand hypothetically fit inside of those same body parts (thus giving an estimate of their sense of the volume of those parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half the participants made the same judgements but used as a reference a book (wrapped in brown paper to hide irrelevant details) and stick, chosen by the researchers to as closely as possible match the actual volume and length of each participant’s hand as determined using a water displacement technique. Participants in this group had to estimate how long their body parts (foot, head, arm, leg, torso, entire body) were in reference to the stick length, and to estimate the volume of those same parts using the bulk of the book as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also went to great trouble to estimate the true length and volume of the participants’ various body parts. This included using water displacement techniques and tape measures to record the length and circumference of various body parts, and then – guided by research on the proportional dimensions of cadavers – extrapolating from these measures to obtain estimates of volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the results revealed an intriguing picture in which participants tended to &lt;em&gt;overestimate&lt;/em&gt; the length of their various body parts, but to &lt;em&gt;underestimate&lt;/em&gt; their volume. Moreover, there was an apparent association with the surface area of body parts, such that the distortion (whether underestimation of volume or overestimation of length) was greater for parts with less surface area. These distortions may partly arise, the researchers suggested, because we are much less aware of signals arising from within the body compared from signals from the outside, thus leading our volume and length judgments to be skewed in contrasting ways by the amount of outward-facing skin on a given body part (an overcompensation in the case of length, and a lack of compensation for volume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The patterns of misperception across body parts thus gave rise to proportionally distorted body shapes, that are similar to a well-known depiction of a somatosensory homunculus and a tall bean-pole respectively,” the researchers said (see images above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there were some judgment differences based on whether the participants used their hand size as a reference point or the objects (the book or the stick), with some of the length overestimates being greater for those who used their hand as a unit of measurement. However, the general pattern of results was the same regardless of the measurement reference used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded “Our findings add to a growing evidence that healthy adults do not have a ‘highly accurate–if not infallible’ representation of their body size as previously assumed, and that their perceptual errors may be determined by the role of body parts in external signal processing.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Now here's a paper with an interesting title: The dark matter of the brain



Author Saak V. Ovsepian argues that &quot;the great majority of nerve cells in the intact brain do not fire action potentials, i.e., are permanently silent.&quot; This is a remarkable claim, and it raises the question of what these silent neurons are doing. However, I didn't find myself convinced of the existence of this 'dark matter'.

Ovsepian points out that numerous studies have found that only a minority of the neuron</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cephalopods are very much unlike the familiar model organisms of mammalian neuroscience; yet they are emerging as a promising model organism in comparative neurobiology and in bio-inspired robotics.

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXV) Metaphors as morphisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1573</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxv-metaphors-as-morphisms/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is a metaphor? Essentially, a metaphor is an analogy that doesn’t say its name. We use metaphors all the time without even noticing it, as was beautifully demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By&quot;&gt;Lakoff &amp;amp; Johnson (1980)&lt;/a&gt;. When I say for example, “let me cast some light on this issue”, I am using a fairly sophisticated metaphor in which I make an analogy between understanding and seeing. In that analogy, an explanation allows you to understand, in the same way as light allows you to see. You might then reply: I &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what you mean, it is &lt;em&gt;clearer&lt;/em&gt;! Chances are that, in normal conversation, we would not have noticed that we both used a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphors are everywhere in neuroscience, and in biology more generally (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/metaphors/&quot;&gt;these posts&lt;/a&gt;). For example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvi-is-optimization-a-good-metaphor-of-evolution/&quot;&gt;evolution optimizes&lt;/a&gt; traits (see the excellent article of &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf&quot;&gt;Gould &amp;amp; Lewontin (1979)&lt;/a&gt; for a counterpoint); &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/&quot;&gt;the genome is a code for the organism&lt;/a&gt; (see Denis Noble (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060581/&quot;&gt;2011a&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsfs.2011.0067&quot;&gt;2011b&lt;/a&gt;)); the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/&quot;&gt;brain runs algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/&quot;&gt;is a computer&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisek.org/pavel/Pubs/Cis1999.pdf&quot;&gt;Paul Cisek&lt;/a&gt; (1999) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredericjoignot.blogspirit.com/archive/2006/06/23/francisco-varela-neurobiologiste-et-bouddhiste.html&quot;&gt;Francisco Varela&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;neural activity is a code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These metaphors are so ingrained in neuroscientific thinking that many object to the very idea that they are metaphorical. The objection is that “evolution is optimization” or “brain runs algorithms” is not a metaphor, it is a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;. Or, for the more dogmatic, these are not metaphors, these are &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indisputable truths belong to theology, not science, so any claim that a general proposition is a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; should be seen as suspect – it is an expression of dogmatism. But there is a case that we are actually talking about theories. In the case of neural codes or brains as computers, one might insist that the terms “code” or “computer” refer to abstract properties, not to concrete objects like a desktop computer. But this is a misunderstanding of what a metaphor, or more generally an analogy, is. When I am “casting light on this issue”, I am not referring to any particular lamp, but to an abstract concept of light which does not actually involve photons. The question is not whether words are actually some sort of photons, but whether the functional relation between light and seeing is similar to the functional relation between explanation and understanding. There is no doubt that these concepts are abstracted from actual properties of concrete situations (of light and perception), but so are the concepts of code and computer. In the metaphor, it is the abstract properties that are at stake, so the objection “it is not a metaphor, it is a theory” either misunderstands what metaphor is (a metaphor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a theory), or perhaps really means “the theory is correct” – again dogmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the mathematically minded, a mathematical concept that captures this idea is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism&quot;&gt;morphism&lt;/a&gt;”. A morphism is a map that preserves structure. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism&quot;&gt;group homomorphism&lt;/a&gt; f from X to Y is such that f(a*b) = f(a) x f(b): the operation * defined on X is mapped to the operation x defined on Y (of course “metaphors are morphisms” is a metaphor!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the “let me cast light on this issue” metaphor, I am mapping the domain of visual perception to the domain of linguistic discourse: light -&amp;gt; words; visual object -&amp;gt; issue ; seeing -&amp;gt; understanding. What makes the metaphor interesting is that some relations within the first domain are mapped to relations in the other domain: use of light on an object causes seeing; use of words on an issue causes understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example in science is the analogy between the heart and a pump. Each element of the pump (e.g. valve, liquid) is mapped to an element of the heart, and the analogy is relevant because functional relations between elements of the pump are mapped to corresponding relations between elements of the heart. Thus, the analogy has explanatory power. What makes a metaphor or an analogy interesting is not the fact that the two domains are similar (they are generally not), but the richness of the structure preserved by the implied morphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a metaphor or an analogy is a theory that takes inspiration from another domain (e.g. computer science), by mapping some structure from one domain to the other. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, on the contrary. Why then is the term “metaphor” so vehemently opposed in science ? Because the term implies that the theory is questionable (hence, again, dogmatism). There are ways in which understanding is like seeing, but there are also ways in which it is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the metaphor “the brain implements algorithms”, &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/&quot;&gt;which I previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;. Some are irritated by the very suggestion that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736&quot;&gt;this might even be a metaphor&lt;/a&gt;. The rhetorical strategy is generally two-fold: 1) by “algorithm”, we mean some abstract property, not programs written in C++; 2) the definition of “algorithm” is made general enough that it is trivially true, in which case it is not a metaphor since it is literally true. As argued, (1) is a misunderstanding of linguistics because metaphor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about abstract properties. And if we follow (2), then nothing can be inferred from the statement. Thus, it is only to the extent that “the brain implements algorithms” is metaphorical that it is insightful (and it is to some extent, but in my view to a limited extent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key question, thus, is what we mean by “algorithm”. A natural starting point would be to take the definition from a computer science textbook. The most used textbook on the subject is probably Cormen et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition&quot;&gt;Introduction to algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. It proposes the following definition: “&lt;em&gt;a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output&lt;/em&gt;”. One would need to define what “computational” means in this context, but it is not key for this discussion. With this definition, to say that the brain implements an algorithm means that there exists a morphism between brain activity and a sequence of computational steps. That is, intermediate values of the algorithm are mapped to properties of brain activity (e.g. firing rates measured over some time window) - this is the “encoding”. Then we claim that this mapping has the property that a computational step linking two values is mapped to the operation of the dynamics of the brain linking the two corresponding neural measurements. I explain in the third part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;essay on neural coding&lt;/a&gt; why this claim cannot be correct, at least not generally and only approximately (one reason is that a measurement of neural activity must be done on some time window, and thus cannot be considered as an initial state of a dynamical system, from which you could deduce the future dynamics). But this is not the point of this discussion. The point is that this claim, that there is a morphism between an algorithm and brain activity, is not trivial and it has explanatory value. In other words, it is interesting. This stems from the rich structure that is being mapped between the two domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is not trivial (as in fact any metaphor), a discussion will necessarily arise about whether and to what extent the implied mapping does in fact preserve structure between the two domains. You could accept this state of affairs and provide empirical or theoretical arguments. Or you could dismiss the metaphorical nature entirely. But by doing so, you are also dismissing what is interesting about the metaphor, that is, the fact that there might be a morphism between two domains. We could for example redefine “algorithm” in a more general way as a computable function, even if it is not what is usually meant by that (as the Cormen textbook shows). But in that case, the claim loses all explanatory value because no structure at all is transported between the two domains. We are just calling sensory signals “input” and motor commands “output” and whatever happens in between “algorithm”. In mathematical terms, this is a mapping but not a morphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, metaphors are interesting because they are morphisms between domains, which is what gives them scientific value (they are models). The problem, however, is that metaphor is typically covert, and failure to recognize them as such leads to dogmatism. When one objects to the use of some words like “code”, “algorithm”, “representation”, “optimization”, a common reaction is that the issue “is just semantic”. What this means is that it is just about arbitrary labels, and the labels themselves do not really matter. As if scientific discourse were essentially uninteresting and trivial (we just observe things and give them names). This reaction reveals a naïve view of language where words are mappings (between objects and arbitrary labels), when what matters is the structured concepts that words refer to through morphisms, not just mappings. This is what metaphor is about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Excessive sedentary time has been identified as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease, but sedentary behavior is nevertheless becoming more common in the workplace. Alongside the adverse health effects associated with sedentary behavior, prolonged sitting also provides opportunity to snack, and subsequently the consumption of junk food is also linked to an increased chance of cardiovascular disease. Although sedentary behavior and diet are separate life style concerns, interventions addressing poor diet are often combined with interventions that address physical activity. Much is already known about combined interventions that address overall diet and physical activity, but much less is known about combined interventions that tackle both diet and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study by Casey &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigates whether reduction of sedentary behavior leads to an alteration in caloric intake. To test this, participants were split up into one group of women having two 15 minute breaks a day, and another group of women having 1-2 minute breaks every half hour. The results of the study suggest that, overall, taking breaks during sedentary time at work reduces caloric intake over time. The researchers suggest that sedentary breaks should be further explored as a means to improve health outcomes for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight loss and eating-related concerns are commonly reported symptoms in advanced cancer patients and survivors. Despite its prevalence, there are no effective interventions to assess or improve food related quality of life for these individuals. Most studies related to this topic assess eating-related difficulties during treatment, but fail to address long term impacts of the ability to “eat well.” Additionally, studies that investigate eating-related difficulties usually focus on the functional aspect of eating, whilst the social and emotional aspects tend to be ignored. Aiming to improve of the food-related quality of life of cancer survivors, the authors consider a more holistic approach to “altered eating”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t join in the conversation with anybody else … because I can’t control the food in my mouth and I need to concentrate so hard on what I’m doing, you’re not part of the social group anyway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to assess and address the altered eating related difficulties experienced by cancer survivors, Watson &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;worked alongside 25 head and neck cancer survivors and their partners. Over the course of 6 years, their workshops identified seven areas of life that affect or are affected by altered eating. These areas include not only anatomical, functional, and sensory alterations, but also the cognitive and behavioral labor of eating, as well as the alterations in social life and identity. As part of their study, the authors have developed a framework that allows assessment and treatment of altered eating, to improve food-related quality of life in cancer survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-018-0232-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrepancies between estimates of wasting measurements for classification of nutrition crisis severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In areas experiencing widespread malnutrition, the prevalence of wasting found in the community acts as a benchmark to inform humanitarian aides on the scale and scope of the response needed. The current standards used by the World Health Organisation, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Federation of Red Cross, and World Food Programme are based on prevalence of wasting criteria as assessed by the weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ). In addition to WHZ, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) can be used as an independent measure of wasting. Although MUAC has become the recommended measure by the World Health Organisation and other public health agencies, there are no separate thresholds to classify crises assessed by MUAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10786&quot; style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mother holding malnourished child&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10786&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/25749470-1-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;213&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© dpa (Deutsche Presse-Agentur)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that there is substantial discrepancy in diagnosis of children as wasted using WHZ and MUAC. As a result, the validity of applying WHZ-based thresholds to MUAC-based estimates of wasting has been called into question. In their study, Bilukha and Leidman investigated the concordance of prevalence of wasting by WHZ and MUAC at the population level. The authors report that there is a poor correlation between population prevalence of wasting as measured by WHZ and MUAC.  Furthermore, they assert that surveys based on MUAC measurements will result in poor concordance with WHZ-based crisis thresholds. The data presented in this study suggest that MUAC may not be the best choice to use as a measurement to classify prevalence of wasting at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While psychology has been mired in a “replication crisis” recently – based on the failure of contemporary researchers to recreate some of its most cherished findings – there have been pockets of good news for certain sub-disciplines in the field. For instance, some replication efforts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/&quot;&gt;cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/12/philosophise-this-a-new-project-has-found-that-psychology-research-by-philosophers-is-robust-and-replicates/&quot;&gt;experimental philosophy or X-phi&lt;/a&gt; have been more successful, suggesting that results in these areas are more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this more optimistic list we may now add personality psychology, or at least the specific area of research linking the Big Five personality trait scores with various personal and life outcomes, such as higher Neuroticism being associated with poorer mental health and reduced relationship satisfaction; higher trait Conscientiousness being associated with less risk of substance abuse; and stronger Extraversion correlating with leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new paper that is in press at &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/k436d/&quot;&gt;available as a preprint&lt;/a&gt; at the Open Science Framework), Christopher Soto at Colby College speculates that perhaps it is the tendency for researchers in personality to use large samples of participants, numbering in the hundreds or thousands, and to use reliable, standardised tests, that is to some extent responsible for the relatively robust results in this area. The new findings “leave us cautiously optimistic about the current state and future prospects of the personality-outcome literature,” Soto writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36304&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soto sourced 78 previously published trait-outcome associations from a major review published in 2006 “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127&quot;&gt;Personality and the Prediction of Consequential Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;“. To see if these effects replicated, he recruited four online samples totalling over 6,000 younger and older participants, and asked them to complete an established 60-item measure of the Big Five personality traits, and then to complete various measures of other life outcomes, covering everything from career to relationship success, to political orientation to criminality (to manage the length of the new surveys some of these were abridged versions of the measures used in the original research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority (around 87 per cent) of the previously published trait-outcome associations replicated. This is not a perfect result, obviously, but it is far more impressive than the average 36 per cent replication rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;achieved in 2015 by the Reproducibility Project’s attempt&lt;/a&gt; to replicate findings across social and cognitive psychology, and the less than 50 per cent success rate reported late last year by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;Many Labs 2&lt;/a&gt; project after its attempt to replicate various social psychology findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of original trait-outcome effects that did not replicate this time included lower Agreeableness not correlating with heart disease and higher Conscientiousness not correlating with greater family satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall impressive replication success rate, between 63 to 71 per cent of the time the replicated effects were weaker than in the original research, and between 30 to 42 per cent of the time the replicated effect was substantially weaker (the precise figures depended on whether the analyses corrected for the use of abridged outcome measures). This indicates that the existing trait-outcome literature contains at least some false-positive results (i.e. null findings erroneously reported as positive). Overall, the new personality trait-outcome associations were about 80 per cent as large as in the original research. On a positive note, the weakening of significant effect sizes seen here is not as dramatic as in the Reproducibility Project in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original results with a larger effect size replicated more often, and it helped if the replication had more statistical power and if it used the same data source and format (for example, if both the original and the replication used self-report questionnaires). The bigger picture, though, is that most results did replicate even though the new research was obviously conducted in a different era (some of the original results date as far back as the 1980s), sometimes in a different geographical locale, and using a different personality measure. This echoes the message from the recent Many Labs 2 Project that found that those psychology results that do replicate tend to be relatively robust in the face of such contextual differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soto’s new replication effort, dubbed “the Life Outcomes Of Personality Replication (LOOPR) project”, meets the highest research standards, with its methods and hypotheses being pre-registered (to avoid the possibility for post-hoc data tweaking and mining) and with all the materials and data made available online at the Open Science Framework. However, as Soto acknowledges, the study is not perfect – for instance, it involved a cross-sectional design with trait scores and life outcomes measured at the same time point, whereas it is advantageous to use a longitudinal design with outcomes measured later; and only a single replication attempt was made for each trait-outcome finding, whereas in future it may be revealing for multiple attempts of the same findings to be attempted, allowing for the influence of moderating contextual factors to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this is surely a welcome news story for the field of personality psychology.  Soto is cautiously upbeat in his conclusion, writing that: “… the extant literature provides a reasonably accurate map of how the Big Five personality traits relate with consequential life outcomes, but that personality psychology still stands to gain from ongoing efforts to improve the replicability of behavioral science.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neonatology ward&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/people-3200398_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1135-6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental perspectives on school food allergy policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States of America, approximately 6 million children suffer from IgE-mediated food allergies. Although fatalities from food-related allergic reactions at schools are low, approximately 18% of allergic children have experienced an allergic reaction whilst at school, and 10% of schools have reported at least one anaphylactic event during the 2013-2014 school year. The United States Department of Education has not yet established food allergy policy recommendations in order to avoid such events, and the current management of food allergies at schools is primarily based on strict avoidance of known food allergens and after-the-fact responses to accidental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10779&quot; style=&quot;width: 342px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;School lunch&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10779&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/kindergarten-2456159_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;332&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafa &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;investigated the parental perspectives of school food allergy policies via a survey, to determine what prevention and response measures parents are aware of, their effectiveness, and the additional food allergy policy needs as perceived by parents. Their study reports that most schools have at least one food allergy policy in place, but parents are still concerned about the safety of their child in school settings. The areas of focus for policy improvement include the availability of epinephrine stocks, improved allergen labeling at schools, increased food allergy education, and an improvement in communication between schools and parents about the policies that are already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1107-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat soluble vitamin deficiencies in children diagnosed with Celiac disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is an auto-immune condition that is triggered when those affected consume food products containing gluten. This immune reaction damages the surface of the small bowel, which leads to malabsorption and mineral deficiencies. Two commonly known vitamin deficiencies in those affected by Celiac disease are the fat soluble vitamins D and K. Deficiencies in these vitamins often lead to osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism and hemostasis disorders. Although adults diagnosed with Celiac disease are routinely screened for fat soluble vitamin levels, there is no routine evaluation for pediatric patients. In their paper, Tokgöz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigate the need for such a routine in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;there is no agreement on vitamin supplement application or the routine evaluation of fat soluble vitamins in patients diagnosed at a young age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that vitamin A and D levels of pediatric Celiac disease patients were significantly lower than those found in the control group, and the majority of patients suffered from an insufficiency or a deficiency for these vitamins. However, no vitamin E or vitamin K1 deficiencies were determined in pediatric Celiac disease patients. Following these outcomes the authors suggest that routine evaluation of vitamin A and vitamin D levels may be beneficial for children diagnosed with Celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1089-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying mechanisms and contexts of successful participation programs for children and youth with disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation in activities and settings that provide challenge, social engagement, belonging, and autonomy is an essential part of child health. However, children and youth living with disabilities experience significant participation restrictions, especially when physical activities are involved. While there is clearly a need to develop successful interventions that promote participation in physical activities for these youngsters, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms and processes that enable a change in children’s participation outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10780&quot; style=&quot;width: 289px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Child in wheelchair playing with peers&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10780&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/wheelchair-538138_960_720-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rehabilitation center &lt;em&gt;Beitostolen Health Sport Centre&lt;/em&gt; (BHC) in Norway runs a Local Environment Model intervention that seeks to enable lifelong activity and participation for people with disabilities. Outcomes observed from this program indicate that physical activity participation may act as a catalyst to promote meaningful responses across all levels of the International Classification of Functioning, disability and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Waterfield &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; systematically review how and why the pediatric program at BHC works. They provide new knowledge on the mechanisms and contexts that may enable participation in activity for children and youth with disabilities, which may be of particular value for policy makers, researchers and health professionals involved in the development of pediatric disability interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1349-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic tool to identify young infants with invasive bacterial infections in the emergency department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom currently follows the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) standards of practice when it comes to treating young febrile infants. As this group of pediatric patients is considered at high-risk of invasive bacterial infections, they are frequently treated with parenteral antibiotics. In order to balance the risk of serious bacterial infections in young infants with prevention of the spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria, tests are being developed to identify young infants with very low risk infections, from whom antibiotic treatment can safely be withheld, and young infants with high-risk infections, which require urgent parenteral antibiotic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NICE guidance appropriately advocates a low threshold for parental antibiotics with the acceptance that some children will be treated unnecessarily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such test is a point-of-care test (POCT) for the biomarker procalcitonin. This biomarker is a precursor for the hormone calcitonin, and is usually present at very low levels in the blood of healthy individuals. However, the blood levels of procalcitonin are significantly higher in patients that suffer from sepsis or septic shock, and therefore has the potential to act as a biomarker for invasive bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Waterfield &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; assessed the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for procalcitonin in identifying young infants with invasive and non-invasive bacterial infections. The researchers conclude in their report that this tool demonstrates excellent diagnostic accuracy for identifying young infants with invasive infections. A tool such as this may be crucial for the improvement of early recognition of serious bacterial infection in very young pediatric patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pediatric patients in emergency departments, hospitals, and ambulatory settings frequently suffer multiple painful procedures. Evidence-based pharmacological and psychological interventions are available to manage and reduce pain, but they are under-utilized or used inconsistently. The lack of sufficient pain management in children may lead to short-term side effects such as anxiety, avoidance behavior, and somatic symptoms. Additionally, in the long-term, it may increase sensitivity to pain, fear, and health care avoidance later in life. Furthermore, the pain suffered by pediatric patients often results in parental or caregiver distress and anxiety during their child’s procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the management of pediatric pain has been highlighted as a key healthcare priority by the World Health Organisation. Among the most common painful procedures are venepuncture and intravenous insertions. In their study, Willis &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; have identified information needs for caregivers whose children are subjected to these procedures to develop a knowledge-translation tool that will allow caregivers to understand how they can help to reduce and manage pain. Empowering the caregivers to take on this role is an important step in procedural pain management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past when scholars have reflected on the psychological impact of dementia they have frequently referred to the loss of the “self” in dramatic and devastating terms, using language such as the “unbecoming of the self” or the “disintegration” of the self. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/8r3dw/&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; released as a preprint at &lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt;, an international team of psychologists led by Muireann Irish at the University of Sydney challenge this bleak picture which they attribute to the common, but mistaken, assumption “that without memory, there can be no self” (as encapsulated by the line from Hume: “Memory alone… ‘tis to be considered… as the source of personal identity”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their review, Irish and her colleagues, including doctoral candidate and lead author Cherie Strikwerda-Brown, present a more optimistic perspective based on their analysis of the research literature on autobiographical memory loss in people with Alzheimer’s Disease, people with Semantic Dementia, and others with Frontotemporal Dementia. “Overall,” they write, “… the self is not entirely lost in dementia, with distinct elements of preservation emerging contingent on life epoch and dementia syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36291&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the authors’ argument is that our autobiographical memories, upon which our sense of self is based, are made up of two interdependent elements: the episodic (the subjective sense of having experienced past events) and the semantic (a factual knowledge of what happened), certain aspects of which are to some extent spared across different types of dementia and different epochs of one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In people with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, they explain that there is often (especially in the early to moderate stages of the illness) a sparing of autobiographical &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, particularly from earlier in life. Specifically, so-called “general event memories” are spared, such as remembering “I used to go dancing on Fridays” or “I used to work as a teacher in my twenties and thirties” – even though a subjective sense of having lived those past experiences is lost. Irish and her colleagues say that this preserved semantic knowledge, including of one’s own traits and preferences, can provide a sense of “narrative self-continuity” and helps explain why social abilities can remain relatively intact for many years after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there are no problems with the sense of self: “They [people with Alzheimer’s] may display an out of date self-schema, in that ‘who I was’ becomes ‘who I am’, and this non-updated framework governs their everyday behaviour,” the authors write, pointing to anecdotal cases of people with Alzheimer’s acting out roles from earlier in their lives, such as believing they are still a nurse (rather than retired) or a mother (rather than grandmother).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Irish and her colleagues explain how people with Semantic Dementia lose much of their factual knowledge about themselves, especially from their more distant past, while they retain their &lt;em&gt;recent, subjectively experienced&lt;/em&gt; episodic memories, especially for the last year or so. These first-hand experiential memories for recent lived experiences – together with a general, temporally unspecified knowledge of the kind of events they experience frequently – can provide another basis for a consistent sense of self, albeit one that is largely rooted in the present and recent past. In turn, this time-limited sense of self may help explain the rigid behaviours and routines often observed in people with Semantic Dementia – a preference for wearing the same clothes, for instance, and always going to the same places at the same time of week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide another perspective, Irish and her team highlight the more severe impairments of self shown by people with Frontotemporal Dementia, which is characterised by marked personality change, together with various degrees of lost semantic and episodic autobiographical memory. While the characteristic traits, humour, morals and behaviour of people with this form of dementia are radically altered by their illness, and perceived as such by close friends and family, the patients themselves lack any self-insight into these changes, which is hugely distressing for their loved ones, but at the same time affords the person with this form of dementia some emotional protection from their condition. Frontotemporal Dementia “equates to a much more profound disruption of the self” according to Irish and her co-authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that we don’t yet know about how different forms of dementia impact upon the sense of self, the review authors also point out – particularly there has been little research on future thinking (the ability to imagine the self in the future) and mind-wandering in these conditions. What limited research that has been conducted has thrown up some intriguing results – for instance, while people with Alzheimer’s have an impaired ability to imagine future events, they describe such imaginings as seeming as vivid as do healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish and her co-authors believe research on mind-wandering may be particularly revealing about the way the self is affected by dementia because in healthy people it often involves thoughts about the self in the past and future – what the authors refer to as “spontaneous expressions of the self”. “More crucially,” they add, “such investigations may provide important insights to guide appropriate interventions to improve overall quality of life in dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message the authors stress repeatedly in their review is that “despite … severe memory disturbances, [for many people with dementia] self-continuity remains present to varying degrees across past and future contexts.” Irish and her team believe this is an important point, not just philosophically but clinically. “Notably, our approach highlights the multifaceted and dynamic nature in which the self is likely to change in healthy and pathological ageing, with important ramifications for the development of person-centred care,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimistic notion that a sense of self can survive dementia – at least in the earlier to moderate stages of the illness – can be considered alongside other research, not mentioned in the review, such as that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/02/18/alzheimers-patients-retain-their-taste-in-art/&quot;&gt;aesthetic tastes&lt;/a&gt; and abilities of people with Alzheimer’s-type dementia is often preserved for many years. Recognising the value in the lives of people with dementia also helps to challenge the offensive “zombie metaphor” that has emerged in some clinical circles (with published book titles like &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease: Coping With A Living Death&lt;/em&gt; being all too common).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As John Zeisel – author of &lt;em&gt;I’m Still Here&lt;/em&gt; – has argued, “it is possible to have a decent life with Alzheimer’s disease, even though most people don’t believe it … In fact, a great many people in the first ten years of this condition live their lives to the fullest – renewing and deepening relationships with those they love and who love them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; Eleanor Morgan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy help people better control their emotions by teaching them new ways of thinking. A recent study &lt;a href=&quot;https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1053811918319402?token=7AF5F08BD5EBD1486AED3C46201760EB92F15996CE747ECFA6956B735F4C81F236B603BD0E96671637701A06BCC52B75&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests this approach could be augmented by using “neurofeedback” to help regulate activity in a key brain structure – the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36227&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a neural level, healthy regulation of our emotions involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.155&quot;&gt;the prefrontal cortex “down-regulating” activity in other brain areas, including the amygdala&lt;/a&gt;. This small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons, located on each side of the brain, is involved in memory processing, decision-making and emotional responses. Problems like PTSD, generalised anxiety and panic disorder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882379/&quot;&gt;are associated&lt;/a&gt; with heightened amygdala activation, raising the possibility that targeting this heightened activation could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Germany, Switzerland and the USA joined forces to investigate whether down-regulation of the amygdala could be increased through providing participants with feedback on their amygdala activity while they tried to regulate their emotions in a fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain scanner.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uwe Herwig and his team placed 15 participants with good mental health in a “Feedback” group and 11 in a “Control” group. All participants underwent four weekly real-time (rt)fMRI emotional training sessions that involved looking at a sequence of negative emotional images (to provoke amygdala activation) and trying to regulate their emotional reaction using a “reality check” reappraisal strategy. Only participants in the feedback group received visual feedback on their amygdala activity while they looked at the pictures and attempted to regulate their emotions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality-checking strategy involved using phrases such as “these are only pictures”, “I am participating in an experiment” and “I am lying in the scanner” (a form of cognitive reappraisal). Alongside this strategy, participants in the feedback group were also provided with visual feedback in the form of changing coloured squares that corresponded with their amygdala activation. In the control group, these colour squares changed randomly and the control participants were told they were meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they performed the “reality check” emotional regulation technique in the fourth week, the feedback group showed significantly decreased amygdala activation as compared to the first week. In contrast, no such down-regulation of amygdala activity was observed in the control group even though they used the same “reality check” exercise.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback group also exhibited increased task-related communication between the amygdala and other brain areas involved in emotional control. However, on the downside, the feedback group did not show greater down-regulation of their amygdala activity in a later, different task in which they were not given feedback and which involved them looking at videos of faces with negative expressions (the researchers speculated that this may have been due to the participants being fatigued and less motivated by this time).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, although the sample sizes were small, the study suggests that amygdala regulation &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be trained by neurofeedback, apparently augmenting the neural effects of a popular emotional regulation technique (though note the behavioral and emotional benefits of this remain unclear at present – the feedback and control groups did not differ in the emotions they said they felt during the experiment, nor in how successful they believed they had been at regulating their emotions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports existing research showing promise for the application of rt-fMRI neurofeedback in the treatment of problems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24244&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, addiction and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088785&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; that are associated with heightened amygdala activation. The clinical potential of this technique, bridging the worlds of neurobiology and psychotherapy, is clear. That said, fMRI scanning is an expensive business, so it may be a while before a new world of personalised mental health interventions reveals itself.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Neurocritic: Is executive function different from cognitive control? The results of an informal poll</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;It ended in a tie!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Is executive function different from cognitive control?&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1090532517843591168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this is a small and biased sample, and I don't have a large number of followers. The answers might have been different had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/russpoldrack&quot;&gt;@russpoldrack&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; in a landslide) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Neuro_Skeptic&quot;&gt;@Neuro_Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; (n=12,458 plus 598 wacky write-in votes) posed the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the poll I facetiously asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Other hypothetical questions (that you don't need to answer) might include&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you a clinical neuropsychologist? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you use computational modeling in your work?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your age? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here, I was thinking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clinical neuropsychologists would say &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computational researchers would say &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, older people would be more likely to say &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; than younger people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the poll I asked, “So what ARE the differences between executive function and cognitive  control? Or are the terms arbitrary, and their usage a matter of context  / subfield?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wanted to expound on the differences between the terms.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I answered &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;, because I think the terms are arbitrary, and their usage a matter of context and subfield. Not that Wikipedia is the ultimate authority, but I was amused to see this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; id=&quot;siteSub&quot;&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;contentSub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-redirectedfrom&quot;&gt;  (Redirected from &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cognitive_control&amp;amp;redirect=no&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive control&quot;&gt;Cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-redirectedfrom&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Executive functions&lt;/b&gt; (collectively referred to as &lt;b&gt;executive function&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;cognitive control&lt;/b&gt;) are a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition&quot; title=&quot;Cognition&quot;&gt;cognitive processes&lt;/a&gt; that are necessary for the cognitive control of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot; title=&quot;Behavior&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt;:  selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the  attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive  processes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control&quot; title=&quot;Attentional control&quot;&gt;attentional control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_inhibition&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive inhibition&quot;&gt;cognitive inhibition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_control&quot; title=&quot;Inhibitory control&quot;&gt;inhibitory control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory&quot; title=&quot;Working memory&quot;&gt;working memory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_flexibility&quot; title=&quot;Cognitive flexibility&quot;&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/cognitive-control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Cognitive  control is the process by which goals or plans influence behaviour. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also called executive control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, this process can inhibit automatic  responses and influence working memory. Cognitive control supports  flexible, adaptive responses and complex goal-directed thought. Some  disorders, such as schizophrenia and ADHD, are associated with  impairments of &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;executive function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're using the terms interchangeably! The terms cognitive control, executive control, executive function, and executive control functions are not well-differentiated, except in specific contexts. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/people/carter.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Dr. Cameron Carter&quot;&gt;Carter Lab&lt;/a&gt; definition below sounds specific at first, but then branches out to encompass many “executive functions” not named as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/research/control.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognitive Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;Cognitive control&quot; is a construct from contemporary cognitive  neuroscience that refers to processes that allow information processing  and behavior to vary adaptively from moment to moment depending on  current goals, rather than remaining rigid and inflexible.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Cognitive  control processes include a broad class of mental operations including  goal or context representation and maintenance, and strategic processes  such as attention allocation and stimulus-response mapping. Cognitive  control is associated with a wide range of processes and is not  restricted to a particular cognitive domain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For example, the presence  of impairments in cognitive control functions may be associated with  specific deficits in attention, memory, language comprehension and  emotional processing. ...  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the term &lt;i&gt;Cognitive Control &lt;/i&gt;dates back to the 1920s, if not further. Two quick examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; When talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and 'g' fame&quot;&gt;Charles Spearman&lt;/a&gt; and his theory of intelligence and his three qualitative principles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.ovid.com/educational-psychology/jedup/1928/01/000/mental-testing-pragmatic-theory/1/00004760&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles S. Slocombe (1928)&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“To  these  he  adds  five  quantitative  principles,  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cognitive  control (attention)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, fatigue,  retentivity,  constancy of output, and primordial potency...”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Simple! Cognitive Control = Attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2017516&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frederick Anderson (1942)&lt;/a&gt;, in The Relational Theory of Mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Meanings, then, are mental processes which, although not themselves objects for consciousness, actively modify and characterize that of which we are for the moment conscious. They differ from other subconscious processes in this respect, that we have &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;cognitive control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; over them and can at any moment bring them to light if  we choose.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cognitive Control = having the capacity of “bringing things into consciousness” — is this different from attention, or “paying attention” to something by making it the focus of awareness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving into the 21st century, two of the quintessential contemporary cognitive control papers that [mostly] banish executives from their midst are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11283309&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miller and Cohen (2001)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“The prefrontal cortex has long been suspected to play an important role in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;cognitive control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in the ability to orchestrate thought and action in accordance with internal goals.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488380&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Botvinick et al. (2001)&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“A remarkable feature of the human cognitive system is its ability to configure itself for the performance of specific tasks through appropriate adjustments in perceptual selection, response biasing, and the on-line maintenance of contextual information. The processes behind such adaptability, referred to collectively as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;cognitive control&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have been the focus of a growing research program within cognitive psychology.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally approached this topic during research for a future post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindstronghealth.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'a healthcare innovation company transforming brain health through pioneering work in measurement science and new models of care delivery'&quot;&gt;Mindstrong&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“digital phenotyping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;” technology.&lt;/span&gt; Two of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindstronghealth.com/about-the-biomarkers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are Executive Function and Cognitive Control. How do they differ? There's an awful lot of overlap, as we'll see in a future post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Another fun (and related) determinant might be, “does your work focus on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;b&gt;”&lt;/b&gt; In which case, the respondent would answer &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; except for one &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Divorytaur/status/1091134962848460801&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deliberately obfuscatory response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anderson F.

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last week, we've continued to make progress on packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662526&quot;&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt; review should be done in a few days. We can then begin on the
MPI versions, and Python bindings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/190&quot;&gt;arbor&lt;/a&gt; is still a WIP. Here's a pre-print the developers published recently
announcing it: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version 1 of the Brian Simulator is now available in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/copr/&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora extras
COPR repository&lt;/a&gt;. This version is in maintenance mode only and users should
prefer the new &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-brian2&quot;&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt; simulator for their work. We only make version 1
available because &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN/pull/617&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; currently does not support version 2---that is a work
in progress. Version 1 of the simulator will not be provided for Fedora
releases after 29 since Fedora 30+ &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Mass_Python_2_Package_Removal&quot;&gt;are moving to Python3 only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A new paper offers a broad challenge to a certain kind of 'grand theory' about the brain. According to the authors, Federico E. Turkheimer and colleagues, it is problematic to build models of brain function that rely on 'strong emergence'.



Two popular theories, the Free Energy Principle aka Bayesian Brain and the Integrated Information Theory model, are singled out as examples of strong emergence-based work.



Emergence refers to the idea that a system can exhibit behavior or propert</description>

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: Format text on your Storefront with Markdown</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2104</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-format-text-on-your-storefront-with-markdown/</link>
	<description>&lt;header class=&quot;article-header clearfix&quot;&gt;Science Exchange supports a syntax called Markdown that allows you to format your Storefront and Service descriptions. You can add headers, lists, bold or italicize text, add links and more, which can help when  your Lab Summary or Service Descriptions are heavy with content.&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of frequently used Markdown shortcuts are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hashtags, you can delineate a line of text as a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# This is a level 1 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## This is a level 2 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### This is a level 3 header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding text with an underscore will italicize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_I like rocket science_ becomes &lt;em&gt;I like rocket science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding text with double asterisks will bold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**I like rocket science**  becomes &lt;strong&gt;I like rocket science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Customer Success personnel can help to optimize the look and layout of your Storefront and Service descriptions for you. If you’d like our help with this, please email support@scienceexchange.com.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Providers: How can reviews and endorsements boost my rankings?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=2103</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-how-can-reviews-and-endorsements-boost-my-rankings/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Search rankings are boosted by the number of orders completed, % positive reviews &amp;amp; ratings, as well as endorsements. Whenever an order is marked complete on Science Exchange, the requester has the opportunity to leave a review. Another factor that influences search rankings is Endorsements, which can be left by anyone who has a Science Exchange account. NPS scores are also collected from requesters, which show up on your Storefront under Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, please see our blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.scienceexchange.com/2015/09/how-the-search-feature-on-science-exchange-ranks-search-providers-in-the-results/&quot;&gt;How does Science Exchange rank service providers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2019/02/providers-why-is-my-service-pending/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To add new experimental services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin typing your experiment name in the “Name” field. Choose the closest match from the drop-down service list that appears. If no appropriate matches  appear, try synonyms or acronyms of the experiment name. Remember that anything you list in the service description will show up in search results when users search the platform, but the actual experiment/service names need to conform to the hierarchy structure we have in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the experiment name you would like to add does not exist in our database yet, you can create a new service name which will be marked as “Pending” until verified by Science Exchange. When creating a new experiment name, please adhere to the Service Naming Guidelines provided below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Service-Naming-Guidelines-1-1.docx&quot;&gt;Service-Naming-Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can add anyone with a Science Exchange account. If they need to sign up for an account, they can join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/signup&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Type in their name and select the correct user from the drop-down menu. Add their title. Then you can choose to make them a Lab Admin if applicable. Lab Admins have access to the Settings tab, which allows them to edit payment information as well as the general information on your Storefront, in addition to being able to respond to customer requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can add a description or leave it blank, but the more information you provide, the better requesters will be able to understand your capabilities.

					&lt;div class=&quot;elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix&quot;&gt;You have full control over the information listed on your Provider Profile, also called your Storefront. To get started editing your Storefront, sign in and click “Dashboard”, you will see your Activities, Storefront, Orders, Settings, Marketing, and Reports tabs.

Click the Storefront Tab, and then the Edit Lab button. The Edit Lab button allows you to update your lab logo, location, and the general summary of your company, which can include your company’s history, capabilities, and any service that you would like to highlight. This is also where you are able to add Lab Tags (either Diversity or License) which can set your Storefront apart.

On the left hand side, you also have more options to customize your Storefront. Upload files to the Resources section such as sample preparation, shipping and handling information, example data, etc. Or, upload Lab Photos of your team, facility, or equipment.

The Services section is the most important area of your Storefront. To add services, sign in and press the Manage Storefront button. Then click the green Add Services button. Start typing the name into the name field and select your service from the drop-down menu.

You can add a description to your Service or leave it blank, but the more information you provide, the better requesters will be able to understand your capabilities. Also, be sure to add the information customers are looking for, such as:

– Instrumentation

– Animals models, cell lines, and/or antibodies you have access to

– Sample requirements (what is required from the researcher in order to perform the experiment)

– Deliverables for each service (including returned samples if appropriate)

– Average turnaround times

– Starting prices for more commoditized services

 

You may also add Service Tags such as equipment, species, or therapeutic area. Just type the service tag in the name field, and select it from the drop-down menu. Be sure to save if you make any changes by clicking the green Save Changes button.&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;

If you choose to arrange your own shipment, we recommend that you post the tracking number to the order page to keep the Service Provider informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the service provider finishes processing your order, they will mark your order as complete. At this time, please review the deliverables and click the green &lt;strong&gt;‘Confirm Completion’&lt;/strong&gt; button to finalize your order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payment is due to Science Exchange after the service provider completes your order.

	<description>A food packaging journal plans to retract a 2018 article by Thai researchers who tried to repackage (ahem) a virtually identical article of theirs, Retraction Watch has learned. That’s not particularly unusual; duplication, sometimes inaccurately called “self-plagiarism,” happens, as they say.

&lt;p&gt;As every parent knows, gentle rocking helps a baby to fall asleep. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31662-2?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218316622?showall=true&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt; by researchers in Switzerland, shows that a rocking bed also benefits adults, extending the time that they spend in deep, slow-wave sleep, helping them sleep more soundly, and increasing their memory consolidation through the night. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31608-7?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218316087?showall=true&quot;&gt;related rocking study&lt;/a&gt; on mice, conducted by a team involving some of the same researchers, and published in the same journal issue, helps to reveal how rocking might have these effects.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36242&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurence Bayer at the University of Geneva and colleagues had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211005392&quot;&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that continuous rocking during a 45-minute nap helped adults to fall asleep and to sleep more deeply. For the new study, they wanted to explore the effects of rocking during an entire night.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen healthy young adults spent a first night getting used to the custom-built bed, which swayed back and forth every four seconds, moving a total of 10.5 centimetres. Next came two experimental nights. One was spent in the rocking bed, and one in a standard bed. During both nights, EEG was used to monitor their brain activity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocking didn’t help the participants enter the first stage of early, light sleep any faster, nor was their REM sleep affected. But they did spend less time in the first few stages of sleep, and nearly a quarter more time in deep slow-wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer and her colleagues also noticed that rocking increased the number of “sleep spindles” during slow wave sleep. These bursts of coherent brain activity are known to help prevent a sleeper from briefly waking – and on the nights the participants were rocked, there was an association between an increase in the “fast” form of sleep spindles and reduced awakenings. (Though brief arousals are common during sleep, they do interfere with normal cycling between the various sleep stages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spindle activity during slow wave sleep is also known to relate to the replaying of memories, which is important for memory consolidation. On the evening before each of the experimental nights, the participants were given a series of word pairs to learn before being tested immediately and then again when they woke in the morning. They performed better on the morning memory test after a night of rocking than after a night in a normal bed. In fact, after a rocking night they did even better on the test than they had the previous evening (this overnight improvement didn’t occur after a night in a standard bed). “This increase in overnight memory accuracy was supported by a decrease in the number of errors and an increase in the number of correct responses only during the rocking night,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might rocking increase slow-wave sleep duration and reduce disruptive waking? “While the exact underlying neuronal mechanism cannot be fully elucidated here, we hypothesize that the rocking effect would be driven by the vestibular system,” they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for this comes in part from the companion study on mice. All-night rocking had slightly different impacts on mice vs. people: when their cages were rocked, the mice fell asleep faster and stayed asleep for longer, but there was no evidence that they slept more deeply. The effects of rocking vanished, however, in mice bred to lack functional otolithic organs. These organs, which form part of the vestibular system, sense forward/backward and sideways motion.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think rhythmic rocking may exert a kind of synchronising action in the brain, inducing a rhythmic pattern of activity in neural pathways from the thalamus, which receives signals from the vestibular system, on into the cortex, directly influencing the appearance of fast sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work is clearly needed to establish exactly what’s going on. But as far as the observed sleep effects themselves are concerned, as the researchers conclude, “These results may be relevant for the development of non-pharmacological therapies for patients with insomnia or mood disorders or even for ageing populations, who frequently suffer from decreased sleep and/or from memory impairments.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of personality in politics is often dismissed as idle gossip, but politicians’ personalities inform their policy choices, shape their campaigning style and predict their chances of electoral success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there has been much speculation that personality may be key to understanding perhaps the biggest electoral shock ever – Donald Trump’s triumph in the 2016 US Presidential election. Many commentators have highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/08/clintons-and-trumps-personality-profiles-according-to-psychologists/&quot;&gt;Trump’s unusually brash, extraverted and narcissistic personality&lt;/a&gt; and proposed that it may &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/&quot;&gt;partly explain his appeal among some voters&lt;/a&gt;. However, before now, there has been little systematic evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psq.12511&quot;&gt;new open-access paper in &lt;em&gt;Presidential Studies Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; addressed this lack of evidence, surveying  875 international experts about the personality traits of 103 political leaders, including Trump and 20 other populists, who took part in 47 elections in 40 countries around the world between 2015 and 2016. Alessandro Nai and his colleagues found that Trump’s traits were rated at the extremes even in comparison to other populist leaders, suggesting a “truly unique and off-the-charts public persona”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36221&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participating experts, who had a slight left-leaning political bias, had academic backgrounds in “electoral politics, political communication (including political journalism), and/ or electoral behaviour”. They each evaluated one political candidate using an established Big Five personality questionnaire and a shortened version of a Dark Triad questionnaire to tap less savoury traits (such that each politician was rated by multiple experts – Trump, for instance, was rated by 75 experts). The experts also scored the candidates’ campaigning style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team were careful to explain that “we do not claim to measure the candidates’ actual psychological profile – and even less, the clinical components of their psyche – but rather their perceived personality (reputation).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the judgment of the participating experts, Trump’s personality is extremely extraverted; extremely low on agreeableness; extremely low on conscientiousness; extremely neurotic (i.e. low emotional stability); and also extremely high on narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism. The only trait where he was rated as average was openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when compared against other populist leaders, Trump came out as having the lowest scores of all on agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability, and the highest scores for narcissism and Machiavellianism. On extraversion he was only outscored by Vladimir Zhironovsky of Russia, and on trait psychopathy only by Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland and Nikola Gruevski of Macedonia. Trump scored significantly higher on all the Dark Triad traits when compared against the average scores of the other populist leaders, making him in the researchers’ words, “an outlier among the outliers”. And when comparing his profile against the average for non-populist leaders, the difference is “staggering”, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of campaigning style, Trump scored very high for the negative tone of his tactics and his use of appeals to voters’ fears, and he had the single highest score for use of character attacks. This fits with the general pattern in the data for traits like low agreeableness and low conscientiousness, and high Dark Triad scores, to correlate with negative campaigning styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Nai’s team believe their data show that what is unique about Trump is not his lack of political experience (other world leaders, like Macron, share this background) nor his personal wealth (again there are other examples, like Putin and Berlusconi), but his personality style. “Systematic comparison between Trump’s public persona and the profiles of other mainstream and populist candidates shows that Trump is, indeed, off the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this new study provides fairly comprehensive comparative data on Trump’s personality and that of many other global politicians, and also demonstrates that there are meaningful associations between politicians’ personalities and their campaigning styles, what it doesn’t do is provide causal evidence that Trump’s personality was the reason for his electoral success, nor for his subsequent behaviour in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team do allow themselves to speculate about the future, however. They point out that given previous research on US presidents’ and other politicians’ personalities – suggesting, among other things, that strong extraverts tend to be more successful, narcissists are willing to take more risks, and disagreeable leaders pass more legislation successfully – that they would “advocate for caution when assuming that Trump will necessarily be a president without major achievements at the end of his term(s)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side, past research suggests narcissistic leaders tend to allow more unethical behaviour among their subordinates, and note that Trump scored very low on conscientiousness, a trait previously associated with success among former presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall,” the researchers concluded, “the comparison of [Trump’s] profile with trends in the literature suggests that Trump will continue to be in campaign mode and be relatively successful in (short-term) crisis management, agenda setting, and the setup of new legislative initiatives. At the same time, his profile will undoubtedly drive impulsive decisions … ” They added, “our results could support the prediction that Trump will be a chaotic president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones. We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons m required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of n variables grows only linearly with n for deep neural networks, but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed. We also provide evidence that when the number of hidden layers is increased from 1 to k, the neuron requirement grows exponentially not with n but with n1/k, suggesting that the minimum number of layers required for practical expressibility grows only logarithmically with n.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through &quot;cheap learning&quot; with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various &quot;no-flattening theorems&quot; showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2^n neurons in a single hidden layer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: A criticism of homo economicus (Or: people are neither rational nor irrational)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1570</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/a-criticism-of-homo-economicus-or-people-are-neither-rational-nor-irrational/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mainstream theory of economics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics&quot;&gt;neoclassical economics&lt;/a&gt;, is based on a very peculiar model of human behavior and social interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NeoclassicalEconomics.html&quot;&gt;The core assumption&lt;/a&gt; is that people’s behavior consists in maximizing “utility”, which is a measure of personal preferences. That is, each situation is assigned some utility and people choose the situation with maximal utility, by making the best possible use of available information. This is called “rational behavior” (this is somewhat related to the view in psychology that perceptual behavior is optimal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs&quot;&gt;which I have criticized&lt;/a&gt; on similar grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model has been criticized repeatedly on empirical grounds, in particular on the grounds that humans are actually not that rational, psychology has documented numerous cognitive biases, and so on. This line of criticism forms an entire field, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics&quot;&gt;behavioral economics&lt;/a&gt;. Epistemologically, economics is quite a particular field because lack of empirical evidence for its core models or even direct empirical contradiction does not seem to be a problem at all. One reason is that the ambition of economic theory is not just empirical but also normative, i.e., it also has a political dimension. In other words, if reality does not fit the model, then reality should be changed so as to fit it (hence the prescription of free markets). It is of course questionable that theories can be called scientific if they constitutively offer no possibility of empirical grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, although the assumptions of neoclassical economics have been pretty much demolished on empirical grounds by psychology (actual behavior of people) and anthropology (actual social interactions; see for example David Graeber’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years&quot;&gt;Debt: The First 5000 Years&lt;/a&gt;”), it still remains the dominant mode of economic thinking because it is intellectually appealing. Of course, political interference certainly has a role in this state of affairs, but here I want to focus on the intellectual aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the field of behavioral economics points out that humans actually do not behave “rationally”, those deviations are depicted as flaws or “bounds on rationality”. If you are not rational, then you are irrational. This is really not a radical criticism. We are bound to conclude that the rational agent is an approximation of real behavior, and everybody knows that a model cannot be exact. Perhaps the model could be amended, made more sophisticated, or perhaps we should educate people so that they are more rational (this seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman&quot;&gt;Daniel Kahneman&lt;/a&gt;’s view). But fundamentally, “rational behavior” is a sensible, if imperfect, model of human behavior and social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these criticisms miss is the fact that both “rational behavior” and “irrational behavior” have in common several implicit assumptions, which are not only empirically questionable but also absurd foundations for an economic theory – and which therefore cannot ground a normative approach any more than an empirical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The first problem is with the idea of “rationality”. Rationality is something that belongs to the domain of logics, and therefore which can only be exerted on a particular model. Thus, to describe human behavior as “rational”, we must first assume that there exists a fixed model of the world and personal preferences, and that this model is not a subject of inquiry. In particular, personal preferences are given and cannot be changed. If, however, the advertisement business is not totally foolish, then this is wrong. Not only do personal preferences change, but one way of satisfying your own desires is by manipulating the desires of others, and this appears to be a large part of the activity of modern multinational companies. The fact that personal preferences are actually not fixed has two problematic consequences: 1) you cannot frame behavior as optimization if the optimization criterion is also a free parameter, 2) it becomes totally unclear how satisfying people’s preferences is supposed to be a good thing, if that means making them want what you sell, rather than selling them what they need; what preexisting economic problem is being solved in this way? Personal preferences can also be changed by the individual itself: for example she can decide, after reflection, that buying expensive branded clothes is futile (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance&quot;&gt;cognitive dissonance theory&lt;/a&gt; about how people change their preferences and beliefs). But again, if that possibility is on the table, then how can we even define “rational behavior”? is it to buy the expensive cloth or is it to change the “utility function”? Assuming preferences are fixed properties of people is the move that allows economic theory to avoid philosophical and in particular ethical questions (what is “good”? see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism&quot;&gt;stoicism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism&quot;&gt;buddhism&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the possibility that people influence each other for various reasons (manipulation, but also conversation and education). Unfortunately those questions do not disappear just by ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The assumption of “rationality” also assumes that people have a fixed model of the world over which that rationality is exerted. They do not learn, for example, and they do not need to be taught either. They just happen to know everything useful there is to know about the world. Building an adequate model of the world, of the consequences of one’s actions, is considered outside the realm of economic theory. But in a normative perspective, this is really paradoxical. One aim of economic theory is to devise efficient organizations of work, in particular which ensure the distribution of accurate information to the relevant people. But by postulating that people are “rational agents”, economic theory considers as already solved the problem it is supposed to address in the first place. In other words, the problem of designing rational organizations of production is dismissed by postulating that people are rational. No wonder that this view leads to the bureaucratization of economy (see David Graeber’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs&quot;&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and Béatrice Hibou’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137495273&quot;&gt;The Bureaucratization of the World in the Neoliberal Era&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Finally, implicit with the idea of “rational behavior” is caricatural reductionism. That is, the presumption that the optimization of individual preferences is realized at the individual level. This, in fact, amounts to neglecting the possibility that there are social interactions – quite problematic for a social science. A well-known example in game theory is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;prisoner’s dilemma&lt;/a&gt;: two criminals are arrested; if they both remain silent, they will do one year in prison; if one betrays the other, he is set free and the other goes to jail for three years; if both betray the other, they both go to jail for two years. Whatever the other decides to do, it is always in your best interest to betray him: this would be the “rational behavior”. The paradox is that two “rational” criminals would end up in jail for two years, while two “irrational” criminals that would not betray each other would do just one year. Thus, “rationality” is not necessarily the most advantageous way to organize social interactions. Or to rephrase, individual rationality is not the same as collective rationality. This is of course a well-known problem in economy, in particular in the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot;&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;” version. But again, this tends to be depicted as an amendment to be made to the core assumption of rationality (cf the concept of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality&quot;&gt;externalities&lt;/a&gt;”), when it actually demonstrates the fallacy of the concept of “individual rationality”. Accordingly, neoclassical economists propose to solve the problem by incentives (e.g. carbon tax). But first of all, this is not the same as building collective infrastructures. And second, what this means is that anything that cannot be modeled as independent individual actions is not addressed by the economic theory, but instead must be tailored in the form of an “incentive structure”. Each collective problem now requires its own complex “incentive structure” designed in such a way that the “free” play of individual rationalities ensures the collective good, which is to say that each collective problem must be solved in an ad hoc way outside of the conceptual framework of theory. In other words, with its focus on “rational behavior”, neoclassical economics sets out to solve exclusively problems that do not involve social interactions. It is not clear, then, what the theory is meant to solve in the first place (how omniscient independent agents manage to organize themselves?), or to demonstrate (selfishness entails collective good, except when it doesn’t?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is actually an important theme of evolutionary theory. Namely, how can social species exist at all, if individualist behavior is rewarded by increased survival and reproduction rate? The answer that evolutionary theory has come to, as well as anthropology and ethology of social animals including primates (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal&quot;&gt;Frans de Waal&lt;/a&gt;’s books), is that social animals display a variety of non-individualist behaviors based on altruism, reciprocity and authority, which ensure successful social interactions and therefore are beneficial for the species. In other words, studies in all those non-economic fields have concurred to demonstrate that efficient collective organizations are not based on individual rationality. This conclusion is not immensely surprising, yet it is essentially the opposite of mainstream economic theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the problem with the “rational behavior” model of human behavior that subtends neoclassical economics is not that people are “irrational”. The problem is that framing human behavior in terms of individual rationality already assumes from the outset that 1) people already have an accurate model of the world, and so no social organization is required to ensure that people’s actions have their intended consequences, this is already solved by people’s “rationality”; 2) people have preexisting fixed “preferences”, and so we don’t need to care about what a “good society” might mean, this is already taken care of by the “preferences”; 3) there is no collective rationality beyond individual rationality, and so there is in fact no society at all, just a group of independent people. Thus, the epistemological implications of the “rational behavior” model are in fact tremendous: essentially, the model amounts to putting aside all the problems that economic theory is supposed to solve in the first place. In other words, the “rational behavior” model of neoclassical economics is not just empirically wrong, it is also theoretically absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.: This is partially related to a recent discussion in perceptual psychology on the presumed optimality of human behavior. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485020&quot;&gt;Rahnev &amp;amp; Denison&lt;/a&gt; (2018) review an extensive literature to show that in perceptual tasks, people are actually not optimal. These findings are referred to in the title as “suboptimality”, but in my view this is an unfortunate terminology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/n48gs&quot;&gt;My objection&lt;/a&gt; to this terminology is that it implicitly accepts the framework of optimization, in which there already is a fixed model of the world for which we only need to tune the parameters. But this means ignoring what perception is largely about, namely modeling the world (object formation, scene analysis, etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Carlos Lopez-Otin was forced to retract EIGHT papers in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, right after he retracted a very important paper in Nature Cell Biology. Spanish elites cry foul, a letter signed by 50 Spanish researchers was sent to JBC to prevent retractions. The ringleader is Juan Valcarcel of CRG in Barcelona, and I release 3 incompetent investigative reports Valcarcel commissioned in 2015 to whitewash his CRG colleague Maria Pia Cosma.</description>

	<description>What, if anything, is the function of adult neurogenesis in humans? Does neurogenesis even exist in our adult brains, or does it shut down during childhood?

The debate over human neurogenesis has been one of the most prominent disputes in 21st century neuroscience. Just last year, two opposing papers appeared in leading journals, one claiming firm evidence of ongoing neurogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus, while the other study came to the opposite conclusion. The fact that adult neuro</description>
