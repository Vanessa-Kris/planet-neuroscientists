	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/normandy-1982417_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils are an important part of our diet  worldwide. As reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/home/en/&quot;&gt;FAOSTAT&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013 the global production of lentils was 4,975,621 metric tons. This food source is known to grow in the cold season in temperate semi-arid parts of the world, spanning North America to Australia. Though, some breeds are unable to survive the frosts of winter, causing concern for agriculturalists attempting to grow these crops in high latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been an increasing need to cultivate lentils which are able to grow in cold settings. This global demand is being addressed in a recent study led by researchers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unileon.es/estudiantes/estudiantes-doctorado/rd992011/programas/biologia-molecular-y-biotecnologia&quot;&gt;Departamento de Biología Molecular- Universidad de León&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agriculturaganaderia.jcyl.es/&quot;&gt;Agricultura y Ganadería&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inea.org/&quot;&gt;Escuela Universitaria de Ingeniería Agrícola&lt;/a&gt; in Spain and at &lt;a href=&quot;http://genxpro.net/&quot;&gt;GenXpro&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The scientists are investigating the gene sequences that are responsible for cold tolerance in lentils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants which can tolerate low temperatures have developed biological adaptions to increase their resilience to the cold. This includes the alteration of their cell membranes, photosynthesis processes, and their gene expression. Of particular interest, are the sets of genes responsible for the tolerance that certain lentil breeds have towards cold and frost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9336 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/chana-390529_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the regulatory proteins that govern this tolerance is important, as these represent ‘transcription factors’ which micro-manage which genes are turned on or off. Stressful settings such as the frost resulting from low temperatures can induce changes in how genes are managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this recently published study, Dr Barrios and the team set out to observe the changing gene expression of lentils in response to cold acclimation. Their aim was to find out which lentil breeds could be considered ‘cold tolerant’ or ‘cold susceptible’ depending on the responses to varying temperatures ranging from -3degC to -15degC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At low temperatures, almost all plants survived with minimum leaf damage. Though, as the temperature was lowered further, the plants showed increasingly different degrees of damage. Leaves with the highest and lowest amounts of damage were analyzed using Deep Super-SAG transcriptome technology in order to extract their messenger RNA sequences. These sequences act as ‘messengers’ across the molecular network, translating genetic information from DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants that were less cold tolerant were named “acclimated susceptible”, while those that were better adapted were “acclimated tolerant”. For full comparison, these were compared against non-acclimatized (non-adapted) versions of the cold susceptible and tolerant types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that the plants that were more acclimated to the cold tended to have an over expression (enhanced activity) of particular gene sets. These were the genes responsible for the production of the amino acids glycine and proline, the maintenance of the plant cell membrane, and the genes that manage photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By finding that these particular gene sets play a key role for the adaption to cold temperatures, this provides opportunistic groundwork for further investigation of the frost tolerance of lentils. Future research may benefit the agricultural industry by helping to boost crop yields in high latitudes of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far has evolutionary thinking permeated through academia? A survey of more than 600 scholars from 22 disciplines, ranging from psychology and economics through to gender studies, sociology and the humanities, finds that there remain two distinct cultures in the academe, at least regarding views on the principal causes of human behaviour and human culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group, made up of psychologists, economists, philosophers and political scientists believes more strongly in the genetic influences on behaviour, beliefs and culture. The other group, consisting sociologists, non-evolutionary anthropologists, women’s and gender studies scholars and all humanities scholars (except philosophy), believes in the primacy of environmental influences. What’s more, those scholars favouring environmental accounts also tend to be sceptical of the scientific method. The findings are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.academicstudiespress.com/index.php/ESIC/article/view/10&quot;&gt;published open-access&lt;/a&gt; in the newly launched journal &lt;i&gt;Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27693&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Carroll at the University of Missouri–St. Louis and his colleagues, including Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University, identified influential scholars in different disciplines based on their authorship of papers in their fields’ leading journals. Each participant rated their agreement with 24 statements pertaining to the nature/nurture debate and gene-environment interactions. The camp favouring genetic explanations tended to agree more strongly with statements like “Human behaviour is produced predominantly or exclusively by genetically transmitted characteristics”. The other camp rated more strongly items like “Human behaviour is produced predominantly or exclusively by environmental conditions, including cultural conventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glimmer of hope for future consensus was found in the fact that both camps tended to answer in the affirmative to items pertaining to gene-environment interactions, such as “Human values, beliefs and feelings are produced by an interaction between adaptations shaped by selection and environmental conditions, including cultural conventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, signs of consensus were somewhat undermined by the participants’ open-ended comments which showed that the two camps had a different perspective on what gene environment interactions mean. For instance, on the topic of gender identity, an evolutionary social sciences scholar said: “I believe gender identity reflects a mixture of genetic and culture inputs, with the genetic being somewhat more important”, while a literary studies scholar said: “I agree that biological characteristics play a role in gender-identity formation but I suppose I absolutely disagree that they do so ‘predominantly'”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most worrying, in the sense of undermining hopes of any future consensus on understanding human behaviour and culture, is that the scholars who favoured environmental and cultural explanations for behaviour also tended to doubt the scientific method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human behaviour is not subject to immutable laws, and, therefore, can’t be studied scientifically,” said a religious studies scholar. “Scientific knowledge has something to tell us about material artefacts and their production, but ‘human nature’, ‘human experience’ and ‘human behaviour’ are not empirically stable,” said a literary studies scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, scholars favouring genetic and evolutionary accounts of behaviour expressed faith in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll and his colleagues said their survey had provided a “statistical snapshot … from a landscape constantly changing” of the diverging views on human nature and culture held by the social sciences and humanities. Their own optimistic feeling is that opinion is moving “unmistakably toward an integrated biocultural view of human behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, will the gap between the two cultures ever be bridged? The greatest obstacle, the researchers believe, is those scholars who declare that human behaviour cannot be studied scientifically (consider the views of another ethnic studies scholar: “I don’t believe in the genetic evolution of species,” they wrote, “There is an imprint of divinity in each person that ensures our commonalities”). Carroll and his colleagues said “Most researchers who regard human behaviour as beyond the reach of science, or who deny that science has any special claims on the production of knowledge, have more academic respectability that creationists, but they are similar to creationists in that they step willingly outside the circle of knowledge susceptible to empirical falsification.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: It’s high time we talked about high heels: The health effects and social pressures of shoe choice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9338</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/08/01/high-time-we-talked-about-high-heels-health-effects-social-pressures-shoe-choice/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/high-heels-1327021_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social pressures behind shoe choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the extent to which the shoe choice of some women is influenced by social norms and external pressures, rather than personal choice. The authors cite an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/611217/results&quot;&gt;online opinion poll of 270 women&lt;/a&gt;, around one third of whom claimed to wear high heels mainly because of social expectation rather than free choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly the same proportion also claimed to have been required to wear high heels at work. Of course, we can question the accuracy of such a poll (for example, many respondents claimed to have worn heels greater than 20 inches high!), but anecdotal evidence does seem to support the notion of some women being forced to wear high heels in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic has received recent media attention in my native UK, since a complaint was issued by a young woman who was ultimately sent home from work without pay because she refused to wear a pair of high heels that satisfied the company’s dress code (2-4 inches, rather arbitrarily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“it is the tension between psychosexual benefits and negative musculoskeletal health effects that makes high heels a topic of substantial public health interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barnish et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the woman launched a petition to make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work- which received over 150,000 signatures- the UK government issued an obscure statement that promised to “remove barriers to equality for women at work”, whilst failing to specify any concrete action to overcome the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous Cannes Film Festival incident of 2015, in which a group of women were allegedly denied access to a film screening because they were not wearing heels, is just one more example of an outdated and baseless policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to examine such political issues in light of the attitudes of the general public towards high heels because, to use the words of Barnish et al., “it is the tension between psychosexual benefits and negative musculoskeletal health effects that makes high heels a topic of substantial public health interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as noted by Barnish et al., there is now scientific evidence to support the common belief that men perceive women in high heels to be more attractive than those without. The authors also highlight the finding that the women &lt;em&gt;wearing&lt;/em&gt; the heels often feel more attractive than when not wearing them. Whilst these views might not be universal, they do little to force companies and governments to rethink their attitudes and policies around high heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomechanical effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the average reader might wonder why I, a biomechanist, should care or even dare to speak of these issues. The answer is simple: as noted by Barnish et al., biomechanical and epidemiological studies conducted over the past few decades strongly suggest that wearing high heels causes widespread negative alterations in the musculoskeletal system, ranging from the spine to the toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomechanical and epidemiological studies … strongly suggest that wearing high heels causes widespread negative alterations in the musculoskeletal system, ranging from the spine to the toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, it seems at best ignorant and at worst downright negligent to continue to require women to wear high heels if they don’t want to. After all, I am quite confident that any proposed policy requiring men to wear something uncomfortable for extended periods of time would be met with stern resistance to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Barnish et al. raise another issue, which is possibly even more troubling than the first. At present it is legal to sell high heels to children in many countries. Although not many studies have examined the effects of high heels on the gait and musculoskeletal function of children, the limited published evidence unsurprisingly suggests that these effects are negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased incidence of high heel wear in recent years in children cited by Barnish et al. is another worrying trend in this light. The authors echo earlier calls to educate school children about the health effects of high heels. The evidence outlined by Barnish et al. suggests that school children are not the only ones who would benefit from such information.&lt;/p&gt;

That paper was a response to and reanalysis of a previous article, and in my post I noted my surprise that the new paper hadn't appeared in Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (NRN), where the original paper had been published.



It turns out there's a bit of a backstory here. According to the senior author of the new paper, Jon Roiser, his group did want to submit to NRN, but they w</description>

&lt;p&gt;While biological differences between the sexes might give men a physical advantage in many sports, it’s possible that they come at a mental cost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454958&quot;&gt;Men typically show a greater spike in the stress hormone cortisol when under pressure than women&lt;/a&gt;, and, given that high cortisol levels can interfere with mental processing, it’s feasible this could mean men’s performance is more adversely affected in high-stakes contexts than women’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016748701630589X?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email#b0110&quot;&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; of elite tennis performance in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is consistent with this account. Based on the outcome of thousands of games played across the four tennis Grand Slams in 2010, the researchers led by Danny Cohen-Zada at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, found that men were adversely affected by high pressure by about twice as much as women. Extrapolating to the world of work, Cohen-Zada and his colleagues said this casts doubt on the argument that the gender pay gap is due to women’s inability to compete under pressure, though they acknowledged there are caveats to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27575&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers accessed data on scores and players for over 1000 men’s and women’s matches played at Wimbledon, The French Open, The Australian Open and the US Open in 2010. They focused on Grand Slams because they offer the same prize money to men and women competitors, which rules out differences in stakes as an explanation for any observed sex differences in performance under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used various statistical techniques to weight the amount of pressure in any given game (including assessing how important the game was for increasing the odds of winning the match) and they looked to see how this affected the server’s performance compared with how often the server typically wins a game (the server has a big advantage in tennis). The researchers also adjusted the numbers to account for the fact that women play best of three games at Grand Slams whereas man play best of five, meaning that early games are more consequential for women than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was ample evidence of high pressure adversely affecting male players’ performance. With a given unit increase in pressure (one standard deviation in statistical terms), men’s likelihood of losing a game in which they were serving increased by 4.9 per cent. For women, the same increase in pressure was associated with an increased likelihood of losing their service game of just 2.8  per cent. This apparent sex difference in the effect of pressure held even after factoring out other influences such as fatigue and differences in ranking between competing players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another analysis, the researchers focused on the effect of high pressure when both players had so far won an equal number of games (to help rule out strategic issues such as one player deciding to give up when they were too far behind). The detrimental effects of pressure were little changed for men in this context, but for women there was now no evidence of choking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our robust evidence that women can respond better than men to competitive pressure is compelling,” the researchers said. “Our results do not seem to support the claim that gender differences in wages in the labor market can be attributed to the fact that women respond more poorly to competitive pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the caveats to this conclusion are the fact that in normal work situations men and women may be competing against each other (for sales targets, for instance), whereas the current results are based on men and women competing separately. In fact, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-111809-125122&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that women’s performance under pressure may particularly suffer in mixed-sex competition. Of course, it’s also not clear how far the current findings pertain specifically to elite tennis or whether they reveal something about men and women’s performance more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/featuredimage-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in microscopy and imaging (e.g.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/milestones/milelight/timeline.html&quot;&gt;histology, confocal microscopy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://magazine.utoronto.ca/spring-2012/milestones-of-medical-imaging-marcia-kaye/&quot;&gt;X-ray tomography, ultrasounds, and MRI&lt;/a&gt;) enhance our understanding of many biological processes. Three-dimensional representations of complex structures obtained with different imaging modalities (e.g. X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) have been especially useful and impressive in vertebrates (including humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9302&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9302 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure1-300x230.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Schematic of our new set-up summarizing the incorporation of CO2 gas as anesthetic during X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of live insect imaging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, imaging whole live invertebrates (e.g. insects) is very challenging. Apart from the acute radiation doses required to obtain the desired image when X-rays modalities are used, movement of the live subjects compromises image quality by producing artefacts. Therefore, research involving invertebrate imaging is usually destructive and requires animal sacrifice, especially in time-course studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To image live insects, it is crucial to fully immobilize the individuals, deliver a sufficiently low radiation dose to allow repeated scans of the same individuals for time-course studies (when X-rays are used), and provide adequate image resolution and quality to distinguish &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; structures. Moreover, the method should have minimal or no subsequent negative effects on life history traits (e.g. growth, reproduction, and longevity) or physiological processes (i.e. normal biological functions) of test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9303&quot; style=&quot;width: 187px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9303 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure2-177x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;3D-CT reconstruction of a live anesthetized Colorado potato beetle adult female depicting the body exoskeleton and the tracheal system (for O2 and CO2 gas exchange in insects) at 20 μm isotropic voxel spacing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we devised a method using carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas as anesthetic to induce hypoxia (oxygen deficient conditions) that prevents motion artifacts during non-invasive imaging of whole live insects for 3D visualization. With this approach (summarised in Fig. 1), we were able to keep the live insects immobile for a prolonged period (up to 7 hours), and repeatedly scan the same individuals using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). We also demonstrated that if the correct scan protocol is used those individuals recover with minimal impact on their subsequent behaviour and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have overcome the technical challenges of live insect imaging by relying on these organisms’ remarkable abilities to survive prolonged hypoxia and ionising radiation doses (at least 100x more than the lethal dose for humans). We successfully employed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as an anesthetic to provide temporary paralysis to keep the insect fully immobilized during micro-CT scanning (similar to a human CT scan where the patient must remain as still as possible) to provide 3D visualization (Figs. 2 &amp;amp; 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9304&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-9304&quot; height=&quot;623&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure3-1024x996.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;3D-CT reconstruction (20 μm resolution) of the whole body showing the internal structures and the tracheal system of a live anesthetized male adult true armyworm at 1 (sexually immature) and 4 (sexually mature) days, demonstrating the feasibility of repeated scanning of the same individual.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we used X-ray micro-CT here, establishing an optimal scanning condition was key due to the unavoidable trade-off in the dose-to-noise relationship (i.e. lower radiation dose = low image quality due to noise, and vice-versa). Our optimised scanning condition produced radiation doses that are at least 80 times less than those used for insect sterilization. Under the optimal condition, insect adults are kept fully immobilized for long enough at relatively low radiation and hypoxic doses from which they can recover rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9305&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9305 size-large&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure4-1024x416.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The method has been successfully tested for other insect life stages. 3D-CT reconstruction at 20 μm resolution of live (i) true armyworm pupa, and (ii) hornworm caterpillar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we successfully exposed live insects (adults and other life stages; see Fig.4) to CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;gas as an anesthetic for whole-body unrestricted immobilization during X-ray micro-CT imaging, with little or no impact on their recovery and behaviour. We believe this new way to visualize live insects can be easily implemented and is compatible with other imaging modalities (e.g. MRI). Within its limitation, this imaging method has various applications in developmental studies (especially in time-course studies) in a range of disciplines such as medical entomology and parasitology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Mitotic progression following DNA damage enables pattern recognition within micronuclei</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23470</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Inflammatory gene expression following genotoxic cancer therapy is well documented, yet the events underlying its induction remain poorly understood. Inflammatory cytokines modify the tumour microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and are critical for both local and systemic (abscopal) tumour responses to radiotherapy. A poorly understood feature of these responses is the delayed onset (days), in contrast to the acute DNA-damage responses that occur in minutes to hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate-limiting steps that are essential for DNA-damage-induced inflammation. Here we show that cell cycle progression through mitosis following double-stranded DNA breaks leads to the formation of micronuclei, which precede activation of inflammatory signalling and are a repository for the pattern-recognition receptor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS). Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–cGAS impaired interferon signalling. Moreover, STING loss prevented the regression of abscopal tumours in the context of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. These findings implicate temporal modulation of the cell cycle as an important consideration in the context of therapeutic strategies that combine genotoxic agents with immune checkpoint blockade.

	<description>Is a small scientific study better than none at all? A provocative piece in Frontiers in Psychology raises the question of whether we should ever do under-powered studies. The authors are Dutch researchers Rik Crutzen and Gjalt-Jorn Y. Peters.





Crutzen and Peters begin by questioning the idea that even a little evidence is always valuable. Taking the example of a study that only manages to recruit a handful of patients because it's studying a rare disease, the authors say that:

	<description>There are three basic types of human smile: &quot;reward&quot;, &quot;affiliative&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; smiles. That's according to a new paper by psychologists Magdalena Rychlowska and colleagues.



Here's the authors' illustration of the types, as posed by actors:

Reward smiles, the authors say, are used to signal enjoyment:

	<title>Brain Blogger: Do We Sense Each Other’s Sickness?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22697</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/28/do-we-sense-each-others-sickness/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social behavior is important for our survival as a species. But social interaction also gives pathogens a chance to spread, and it thereby increases our exposure to infection. Our immune system is a complex defense system that has evolved to protect us from infections. Therefore, it makes sense to assume that our immune system must have developed ingenious strategies to protect us from new pathogens to which social interaction has exposed us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Evidence of a link between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/24/can-our-immune-system-drive-our-social-behavior/&quot;&gt;immune system and our social behavior&lt;/a&gt; has been accumulating in the last years. A direct connection between the brain and the immune system, through lymphatic vessels in the meninges, was recently revealed. Then it was shown that the immune system can directly affect, and even control social behavior and the desire for social interaction – an impaired immunity was shown to induce deficits in social behavior. This sounds like a clever preventive self-defense mechanism designed to avoid contagion – in times of poor immunity, our brain gets the message to reduce social interaction and, consequently, exposure to pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This is a self-defense mechanism that is activated when our body signals a poor immunological status; it’s an internal chemical communication system. But is there an external threat signaling system? The ability to detect and avoid infected individuals would clearly be a great evolutionary asset in strengthening our protection mechanisms. Many animals can detect sickness via odors, leading to a restraint in social interaction, most likely intended to reduce exposure to disease. Do humans have a similar sensory sickness detection system, something that allows us to detect infectious threat in others?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;To answer this question, a new study aimed at determining whether humans can detect sickness in others from visual and olfactory cues. Sickness was experimentally induced through the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecule found in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that provokes robust immune responses. The activation of immune responses leads to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory molecules that activate sickness responses and behaviors. It is known that visual cues of sickness, such as redness of the skin, allow us to infer the health of others. But although LPS induces a strong sickness response, its observable effects are subtle, and odor cues are difficult to perceive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Photos of the face and samples of body odors of both sick and healthy individuals were presented to a group of naïve participants while their cerebral responses were recorded using fMRI. These participants were not aware that they would be seeing and smelling sick and healthy people. They were asked to focus on the faces while the odors were also presented and rate how much they liked the person. Faces were also rated on attractiveness, health, and desired social interaction, and odors were rated on intensity, pleasantness and health. This allowed the assessment of the “liking behavior” towards the faces, an indication of the will to approach and interact with others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The rating of sick and healthy faces showed that photos obtained during acute sickness were generally considered less attractive, less healthy, and less socially desirable than the faces of participants receiving the placebo treatment. When faces were presented concomitantly with an odor, there was a lower liking of sick than of healthy faces, regardless of the odor presented with the face. Although participants were not able to perceive sickness in the odors, nor did they rate sick odors as more unpleasant or more intense than healthy odors, faces, regardless of being sick or healthy, were also less liked when paired with sick body odor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;These results show that we can detect early and subtle signs of sickness in others from both facial and olfactory cues, even just a couple of hours after activation of their immune system. Moreover, fMRI data revealed that visual and olfactory sickness cues activated their respective visual face processing and olfactory sensory cortices,  as well as multisensory convergence zones. And even though odors were often too weak to be consciously detected, these olfactory sickness cues still led to activation of the olfactory cortex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The study also revealed that this perception of subtle cues of sickness leads to reduced liking and decreased will for social interaction. This response may represent a human behavioral defense system against disease. The integration of olfactory and visual sickness cues in the brain may be part of a mechanism designed to detect sickness, resulting in behavioral avoidance of sick individuals, and in avoidance of impending threats of infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A journal has retracted a 2012 paper after determining that the authors had already published it elsewhere. According to the retraction notice, the editors-in-chief of the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology concluded that the article had  been published in another journal—In Vitro Cellular &amp;amp; Developmental Biology – Animal—the previous month.

&lt;p&gt;In most human societies those with a higher social status enjoy privileges beyond the reach of others. Such status can be obtained through dominance, using intimidation or force, or acquiring prestige by demonstrating knowledge and skill. To make best use of the benefits though, other people need to know that you are top dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re of a lower status, there are probably times when it pays to avoid challenging those higher up the pecking order. In which case, you might want to convey your recognition of their authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using body language, such as by taking up more space (adopting “power poses”) may be one of the most obvious, visible modes of asserting ourselves. But of course speech also conveys status, not only in its content, but in the characteristics of the voice itself. Indeed, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt; we adjust the pitch of our voice depending on who we are talking to. The research group at the University of Stirling found that the direction of this unconscious vocal tuning depends on the speaker’s perception of their social status relative to the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27550&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan David Leongómez and his colleagues recorded students as they took part in simulated interviews for a job as an admin assistant with three different male employers (the order of the interviews was varied between participants). A picture and description of each employer showed one to be highly dominant (Chief of Security at a prison, described as tough and intimidating), another highly prestigious (Head of Department at a Business School, described as well-respected and competent), and a third was neutral (from the HR department at a secondary school, described as your average boss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants had to introduce themselves to the employer, and explain why they were suited to the job. They were also asked about how they would approach their boss if they had a disagreement with a colleague. After all the interviews, the participants filled out a questionnaire about their own and the employers’ dominance and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the recordings, the researchers calculated the “fundamental frequency” of the participants’ voices (an objective measure of pitch) and tracked variations in their voice pitch as they spoke. A low fundamental frequency would equate to sounding calm and in control, and has been found to be perceived as more dominant in both male and female voices, although the natural sex difference in absolute pitch was accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking to the highly dominant and prestigious employers, both male and female students who also perceived themselves as more dominant lowered their voice pitch, whilst students who perceived themselves to be less dominant did the opposite. These changes in pitch were most noticeable when the students explained why they were the best candidate and talked about how they would resolve the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research showing that lower voice pitch conveys traits related to social status, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1699/3509&quot;&gt;physical strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20166/abstract%253Bjsessionid=7B1CDF1E0D76686151076240323D21EA.f03t03&quot;&gt;attractiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that the students’ perception of their own status led them to use different vocal strategies in the interviews with the high-status employers. The students with higher self-perceived dominance may have felt more confident and in control of the situation, and thus more able to compete for the job. Conversely, for those who rated themselves less dominant, and may have felt more intimidated, appearing deferent to the employer may have been a beneficial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the employers were actually computerised faces created to appear prestigious, dominant or neither, so it’s not clear how these findings would relate to a prestigious employer in real-life, or to a less formal social setting. Mock job interviews have been shown to increase anxiety, and recording the participants’ speech is likely to have increased their stress further, making voice alterations more or less pronounced than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-life implications of the effect are also not known, as the study did not address which group were more likely to be successful in the interview. Whilst being intimidated might not come across well, it’s probably not a good idea to compete with your boss either. CEOs with lower-pitched voices tend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(13)00023-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;manage larger companies and make more money&lt;/a&gt;, but then again, surgeons whose voices were perceived to be higher in dominance, and possibly arrogance, were more likely to have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(02)00022-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;sued for malpractice&lt;/a&gt;.  Suffice then to say that, when asserting status, context – and subtlety – is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407&quot;&gt;Perceived differences in social status between speaker and listener affect the speaker’s vocal characteristics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/5800280179_79e5efb43d_o-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis B – What it is and why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2893.2003.00487.x/full&quot;&gt;2 billion individuals&lt;/a&gt; have been infected by Hepatitis B virus (HBV) at some point during their lifetime. Within the first 6 months after an individual is first infected with HBV, they experience a short term (acute) illness. In some cases of acute infection, the HBV remains in an individual’s body causing them to be chronically infected with Hepatitis B. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/&quot;&gt;2015 WHO report on Hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; estimated 257 million people (3.5% of the global population) were living with a chronic HBV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since HBV primarily attacks the liver, chronic HBV infection can imply significant long term health problems including liver damage, failure or even death. Untreated chronic infection can lead to life threatening long term complications such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (a form of liver cancer). HBV is the 10th leading cause of death globally and results in &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2893.2003.00487.x/full&quot;&gt;500,000 to 700,000 deaths annually&lt;/a&gt;. Although relatively rare in the West, in regions where HBV remains endemic like Asia, the Western Pacific region and Africa, chronic HBV infection is common and individuals are often first exposed to the virus as infants or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be spread through bodily fluids such as blood, semen etc. from an infected individual. The most common routes are sexual contact, sharing items (needles, razors, toothbrushes) with an infected person, exposure to infected blood or perinatal transmission (from a mother to child around the time of birth or during breastfeeding). The latter is the main route of transmission in areas where Hepatitis B is endemic like Asia, the Western Pacific and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge and importance of preventing HBV transmission to infants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The younger an individual is when they contract acute HBV, the higher the likelihood that they will develop the chronic form. This is visualized in the graph below which reflects the percentage of individuals who become chronic HBV carriers in relation to the age at which they were acutely infected. For example approximately 90% of infants who are infected around the time of birth become chronic carriers , in contrast less than 5% of individuals acutely infected as adults are chronic carriers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9323&quot; style=&quot;width: 519px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9323&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/age-risk-HBV-e1501072076560.png&quot; width=&quot;509&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHO Global Hepatitis report 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the risk of infants being acutely infected, babies born to HBV-positive women are regularly given vaccines and other immunoprophylaxis after birth. However 5-10% of vaccinated infants still contract the acute form of the virus. This indicates additional intervention is required to effectively reduce or eliminate transmission to infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants are an especially critical target population in reducing the prevalence of Hepatitis B, especially since infection rates are still relatively high, and early exposure leads to a higher risk of the disease becoming a chronic life-long disease. For example, long term follow up of individuals infected as infants or young children showed that 15-25% of those chronically infected die prematurely due to cirrhosis or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jgo.amegroups.com/article/view/12998/10854&quot;&gt;hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445312003891?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;High HBV activity in the mother correlates with the infant’s risk of contracting the condition&lt;/a&gt;, even if the infant has been immunized after birth. Therefore an antiviral therapy which reduces the HBV activity in the mother may be able to prevent the infant from contracting the disease. There are six globally licensed treatments for adults affected by chronic HBV, but none are currently regularly used in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antiviral drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telbivudine&quot;&gt;telbivudine&lt;/a&gt; is an attractive candidate for preventing mother to child transmission of HBV. It has been classified as pregnancy category B, which implies that no risk has been shown in other studies, but risk has not been definitively excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356512001553&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827811002832?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) have reported that administration of the antiviral telbivudine in the second and third trimesters was highly safe and effective in blocking mother to infant transmission . However, further extensive studies are required to ensure safety and efficacy before it can be considered for regular use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue of establishing drug safety in pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9327&quot; style=&quot;width: 309px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9327&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/15514557255_56036a1775_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr, cc Jerry Lai&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that any treatment given for a maternal medical condition, such as HBV, does not disrupt the baby’s normal process of development or cause significant negative side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was clearly illustrated by thalidomide, a drug taken by expecting mothers to combat morning sickness. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdrc.21096/full&quot;&gt;thalidomide&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced as an over the counter drug in 1957, scientists did not believe drugs could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. Unfortunately, this was not the case and it is estimated that over 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with developmental abnormalities (classically of the limbs called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocomelia&quot;&gt;phocomelia&lt;/a&gt;)  as a result of thalidomide exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although finally taken off the market in 1961, the detrimental effects of thalidomide were long reaching and prompted the implementation of more rigorous rules for the testing and licensing of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tolerability of a drug by the growing fetus may depend on its stage of development- certain drugs may therefore be potentially safe to take in late pregnancy but not during the first trimester when the fetus is very vulnerable to environmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of HBV treatment during pregnancy, one of the questions which remains unanswered is whether there is a difference in efficacy if antivirals are given to pregnant women during early pregnancy, and additionally whether this can be tolerated by a more vulnerable, less developed fetus. To begin to answer this, Dr. Sun and colleagues recently conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-017-0608-7&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telbivudine if commenced in early or middle pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antiviral HBV treatment during early and mid-pregnancy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sun and colleagues compared markers of HBV infection and activity in three different experimental groups. One group of women began the antiviral treatment in early pregnancy (12 weeks), another in middle pregnancy (20-28 weeks) while the third group acted as a control and received no drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per standard care, all infants in all groups received standard vaccinations and preventative treatment after birth. At 28 weeks following birth, infants were tested to check for the presence of HBV DNA or HBV antibodies, which indicates maternal to child transmission of the disease had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were clear cut- none of the infants born to mothers who were receiving the antiviral treatment showed biological markers of the disease. In contrast, in the group that did not receive the antiviral during pregnancy, ~18% of infants had markers of HBV activity 28 weeks after their birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous studies, these results suggest that treating mothers during to pregnancy with the antiviral telbivudine together with infant vaccination at birth appears more effective than infant vaccination alone. Additionally, it suggests antiviral administration may be equally effective if begun in early versus middle pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9328&quot; style=&quot;width: 331px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9328&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/11522188665_5145d29be7_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr, cc Jens Bergander&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the work by Sun and colleagues showed promising results, it also raises a number of other important questions which would need to be resolved before the antiviral can be used outside of controlled clinical trials. For example, the optimal timing and dosage are still to be determined, as well as how late in pregnancy the antiviral can be given and still successfully prevent transmission. Additionally, while no ill effects were observed in the infants whose mothers received telbivudine during pregnancy, it is important to note that potential negative effects have not been ruled out and more extensive studies with long term follow up are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a critical stepping stone towards the development, implementation and safety of programs which could drastically reduce the perinatal transmission of HBV- and provide infants a healthy start to life.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Diet segregation in American bison of Yellowstone National Park</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9315</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/27/diet-segregation-american-bison-yellowstone-national-park/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Bison-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mammals, sexes often differ in adult body size, with adult males being substantially larger than their female counterparts. This variation in body size can lead to significant differences in nutritional requirements, a phenomenon commonly referred to as diet segregation. Females, due to their smaller size and shorter digestive tract, tend to process food more rapidly than males do, and as a result, require higher quality food. Because of their larger size, males are more efficient at converting low-quality food into usable energy, and thus, are more concerned with quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in nutritional demands between sexes can lead to different habitat requirements, particularly among large mammalian herbivores. One such example is the American bison (&lt;em&gt;Bison bison&lt;/em&gt;), which once roamed freely over much of North America. Although American bison primarily eat grass, they also consume minor amounts of herbs, shrubs, and twigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In American bison, the sexes vary greatly in size, with the average male weighing 350 kg more than the average female. During the late-summer mating season, male and female bison form large herds, and remain in these groups for approximately one month. Throughout the rest of the year, females and calves remain in groups, while males typically spend this time roaming the landscape as individuals. If segregation behavior in bison is influenced by sex-specific nutritional demands, then differences in the diets of males and females should be more apparent during certain times of year than others (e.g., mating season vs. the rest of the year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellowstone National Park (YNP), which lies in the northwest corner of Wyoming U.S.A., is a forested mountain ecosystem with grasslands, wetland meadows, and geothermal areas. Yellowstone is the only place in the United States where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times, and they are one of seven species of native ungulate resident to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9318&quot; style=&quot;width: 1156px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9318&quot; height=&quot;860&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Bison-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1146&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A herd of bison at Yellowstone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;John Berini&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Yellowstone, the bison population consists of two geographically distinct subpopulations that reside in the Northern and Central ranges. These ranges differ in bedrock geology, soil type, topography, geothermal activity, and winter severity. In addition, both elk and bison are more abundant on the Northern Range than on the Central Range. These differences likely influence the composition and quality of bison diets in each range. If segregation of bison in YNP is influenced by sex-specific nutritional demands, then the degree of diet segregation in each range should differ as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine if the diets of males and females are different, we collected samples of bone from the skeletons of adult bison. We also collected fresh fecal samples by observing and following individual adults during the late-summer mating season. From these samples, we determined the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and fecal nitrogen content. These properties of bone and fecal samples indicate the protein content and diversity of plants consumed by individual animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9319 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1321&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Bison-3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;John Berini&quot; width=&quot;991&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that the diets of male and female bison in YNP vary in composition, quality, and breadth. During the mating season, the average diet of male and female bison is composed of different plants. Females have higher quality diets, and males have more diverse diets. Throughout the rest of the year, the average diets of male and female bison are composed of similar items. However, females still have higher quality diets, and males, more diverse diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that both subpopulations exhibit diet segregation, but they do so during different times of year. In the Central Range, diet segregation was apparent during the mating season, whereas in the Northern Range, diet segregation was apparent during the non-mating season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, someone takes their own life every 45 seconds. To help prevent future tragedies, we need to know more about the factors that make some people especially vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and acting on those thoughts. One candidate is perfectionism: the tendency some people have to hold themselves to consistently impossible standards and/or feeling the need to meet or surpass the lofty expectations of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995 the late psychologist Sidney Blatt highlighted the apparent link between perfectionism and suicide in an influential article for &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt; titled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1996-14509-001.pdf&quot;&gt;The Destructiveness of Perfectionism&lt;/a&gt;” in which he profiled three highly talented, ambitious but harshly self-critical individuals all of whom took their own lives: Vincent Foster, a deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton; writer, singer and broadcaster Alasdair Clayre; and athlete and scholar Roger D Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of the need to maintain a personal and public image of strength and perfection, [perfectionists] are constantly trying to prove themselves, are always on trial, feel vulnerable to any possible implication of failure or criticism, and often are unable to turn to others, even the closest of confidants, for help or to share their anguish” Blatt wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since Blatt’s paper, research progress on the topic has been slow, hampered in part by a confusing multitude of definitions of perfectionism and a paucity of studies with the longitudinal methodology needed to establish that perfectionist tendencies increase suicidal risk. But now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12333/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle&quot;&gt;writing in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Martin Smith at the University of Ontario say there is enough data to conduct a “meta-analysis”, which is what they’ve done, producing “the most comprehensive test of the perfectionism-suicidality link to date”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27424&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 45 relevant, suitably robust studies involving collectively 54 samples, totalling 11,747 participants. Forty-eight of the samples were cross-sectional (measures were only taken at a single point in time) while six had the all-important longitudinal design, granting insight into whether perfectionism may precede suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Collectively, the studies covered 15 of the different definitions and ways of measuring perfectionism that exist, most falling under the main categories of either placing excessive expectations on oneself, feeling pressure from others (including parents or society at large), or holding other people to perfectionistic standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the analysis showed that 13 of the 15 different measures of perfectionism had associations with increased suicidal thoughts (in statistical terms the effect size was small to moderate). Aspects of perfectionism related to concerns about meeting others’ expectations were additionally associated with making more suicide attempts. Meanwhile, holding others to high standards, and being perfectionist in terms of tidiness and organisation, were not related to suicidal thoughts or attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perfectionists,” the researchers explained, “are their own worst critics … locked in an endless loop of self-defeating over-striving in which each new task is another opportunity for harsh self-rebuke, disappointment, and failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most pernicious form of perfectionism seems to be feeling the weight of meeting other people’s expectations – this was related to increased suicidal thoughts in longitudinal studies that followed the same participants over time and that controlled for their baseline levels of suicidal thought.  “Our findings lend credence to the long-standing notion that feeling incapable of living up to the lofty standards of others is a part of the premorbid personality of people at risk for suicide,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s notable that past research has found trait conscientiousness (one of the Big Five personality traits associated with self-discipline and orderliness) is associated with &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; risk of suicide. This suggests perfectionism as defined here – holding oneself to unrealistic standards, or seeking to meet the unrealistic standards of others – is not simply a form of excessive conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is the most thorough examination of the links between perfectionism and suicide to date, and the data suggests that perfectionism is a relevant risk factor, it’s important to note that the research base is still lacking. There is especially a need for more longitudinal research, more research with diverse groups (most of the studies to date have involved White Western people) and more research that tests whether perfectionism adds risk even after other factors are taken into account, such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers said the data are consistent with “case histories and theoretical accounts suggesting people high in perfectionism appear to think, behave, perceive, and relate in ways that have suicidogenic consequences”. Perfectionism is associated with “intense psychological pain” they said. Perfectionists have a “harsh way of relating to a self they find deficient”. Their lives are typically stressful and they often have a “prickly, conflictual style of relating to others,” leaving them isolated and lacking support. “Amid such pain,” Smith and his colleagues conclude,” perfectionists may think about, or engage in, suicide as a means of escaping a life they find unbearable.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Are journals necessary filters?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1433</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/are-journals-necessary-filters/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/the-great-misunderstanding-about-peer-review-and-the-nature-of-scientific-facts/&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I argued that one reason why many people cling to the idea that papers should be formally peer-reviewed before they are published, cited and discussed, despite the fact that this system is a recent historical addition to the scientific enterprise, is a philosophical misunderstanding about the nature of scientific truth. That is, the characteristic of science, as opposed to religion, is that it is never validated; it can and must be criticized. Therefore, no amount of peer reviewing can ever be a stamp of approval for “proven facts”. Instead what we need is public discussion of the science, not stamps of approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that post came up another common reason why many people think it’s important to have journals that select papers after peer-review. The reason is that we are crowded with millions of papers and you can’t read everything, so you need some way to know which paper is important, based on peer-review. So here this is not just about peer-reviewing before publishing, but also about the hierarchy of journals. Journals must do an editorial selection so that you don’t have to waste your time reading low-quality papers, or uninteresting papers. What this means, quite literally, is that you only read papers from “top journals”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to show that this argument is untenable, because selecting their readings based on journal names is not what scientists should do or actually do, and because the argument is logically inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it logically inconsistent? If the argument is correct, then those papers accepted in lower rank journals should not be read because they are not worth reading. But in that case, why publish them at all? There seems to be no reason for the existence of journals that people do not read because they do not have time to read bad papers. If we argue that those journals should exist because in some cases there are some papers worth reading there, for any sort of reason, then we must admit that we don’t actually use journals as filters, or that we should not use them as filters (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it good scientific practice to use journal names as filters? What this implies is that you ignore any paper, including papers in your field and potentially relevant to your own studies, which are not published in “top journals”. So for example, you would not cite a relevant study if it’s not from a top journal. It also means that you don’t check that your own work overlaps other studies. So you potentially take credit for ideas that you were not the first to have. Is this a professional attitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in fact you don’t totally ignore those lower journals, then you don’t actually use journal name as a filter, you actually do look at the content of papers independently of the journal they are published in. Which is my final point: to use journal names as filters is not the normal practice of scientists (or maybe I’m optimistic?). When you look for relevant papers on your topic of interest, you typically do a search (eg pubmed). Do you only consider papers from “top journals”, blindly discarding all others? Of course not. You first look at the titles to see if it might be relevant; then you read the abstract if they are; if the abstract is promising you might open the paper and skim through it, and possibly read it carefully if you think it is worth it. Then you will look at cited papers; or at papers that cite the interesting you just read; or you will read a review; maybe a colleague or your advisor will suggest a few readings. In brief: you do a proper bibliographical search. I cannot believe that any good scientist considers that doing a bibliographical search consists in browsing the table of contents of top journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only case when you do use journal names to select papers to read is indeed when you read tables of contents every month for a few selected journals. How much of this accounts for the papers that you cite? You can get a rough idea of this by looking at the cited half-life of papers or journals. For Cell, it’s about 9 years. I personally also follow new papers on biorxiv using keywords, while most new papers in journals are irrelevant to me because they cover too many topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary: using journals as filters is not professional because it means poor scholarship and misattribution of credit. Fortunately it’s not what scientists normally do anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One related argument that came out in the discussion of my previous post is that having papers reviewed post-publication could not work because that would be too much work, and consequently most papers would not be reviewed, while at least in the current system every paper is peer reviewed. That is wrong in several ways. First, you can have papers published then peer-reviewed formally and publicly (as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1000research.com/&quot;&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/a&gt;), without this being coupled to editorial selection. Second, if anything, having papers submitted a single time instead of many times to different journals implies that there will be less work for reviewers, not more. Third, what is exactly the advantage of having each paper peer-reviewed if it is argued that those papers should not be read or cited? In the logic where peer review in “good journals” serves as filters for important papers, it makes no difference whether the unimportant papers are peer reviewed or not, so this cannot count as a valid argument against post-publication review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this being said, there is still a case for &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/free-the-journals/&quot;&gt;editorial selection &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; publication&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the many ways to discover papers of interest, see for example my &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;free journal of theoretical neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Brain Blogger: Nurturing the Brain – Part 11, Magnesium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22677</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/26/nurturing-the-brain-part-11-magnesium/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is everywhere – it does not occur free in nature, only in combination with other elements, but it is the eighth most abundant chemical element in the Earth’s crust and the third most abundant element in seawater; it is even the ninth most abundant in the Milky Way. In the human body, magnesium is the fourth most abundant ion and the eleventh most abundant element by mass, being stored in bones, muscles, and soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is fundamental for health: it is essential to all cells and to the function of hundreds of enzymes, including enzymes that synthesize DNA and RNA, and enzymes involved in cellular &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/&quot;&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are vital. Magnesium is involved in virtually every major metabolic and biochemical process in our cells and it plays a critical role in the physiology of basically every single organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low plasma levels of magnesium are common and are mostly due to poor dietary intake, which has lowered significantly in the last decades. Magnesium can be found in high quantities in foods containing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/19/the-brain-gut-axis-part-2-brain-gut-microbiota-communication/&quot;&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt;, including green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. But although magnesium is widely distributed in vegetable and animal foods, some types of food processing can lower magnesium content up to 90%. Also, the soil used for conventional agriculture is becoming increasingly deprived of essential minerals. In the last 60 years, the magnesium content in fruit and vegetables has decreased by around 20 to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic magnesium deficiency due to low dietary intake in healthy people is not very frequent, but a consistently poor dietary supply of magnesium has insidious effects. Magnesium deficiency alters biochemical pathways and increases the risk of a wide range of diseases over time, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2006/12/21/hypertension-drugs-affect-alzheimers/&quot;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, osteoporosis, and migraine headaches, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, magnesium is an important regulator of neurotransmitter signaling, particularly glutamate and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2007/06/25/yoga-increases-gaba-levels-in-brain/&quot;&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;, the main neurotransmitters by modulating the activation of NMDA glutamate receptors and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. It also contributes to the maintenance of adequate calcium levels in the cell through the regulation of calcium channels’ activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These physiological roles make magnesium an essential element in important neuronal processes. Magnesium participates in the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, neuronal plasticity, and consequently, learning and memory. Accordingly, increased levels of magnesium in the brain have been shown to promote multiple mechanisms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/25/exercise-and-brain-aging/&quot;&gt;synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt; that enhance different forms of learning and memory, and delay age-related cognitive decline. Increased levels of magnesium in the brain have also been linked to an increased proliferation of neural stem cells, indicating that it may promote the generation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in adulthood. This is an important feature because neurogenesis is a key mechanism in the brain’s structural and functional adaptability, in cognitive flexibility, and in mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplementation has also been shown to modulate the neuroendocrine system and to improve sleep quality by promoting slow wave (deep) sleep, which, among many other functions, is also important for cognition and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, magnesium may enhance the beneficial effects of exercise in the brain, since it has been shown to increase the availability of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/06/26/blood-glucose-and-the-brain-sugar-and-short-term-memory/&quot;&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; in the blood, muscle, and brain, and diminish the accumulation of lactate in the blood and muscles during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as increasing magnesium levels can be beneficial, magnesium deficiency can have serious harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium has important roles in the regulation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/08/stress-shortens-life/&quot;&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, inflammatory processes and modulation of brain blood flow. In circumstances of magnesium deficiency, all of these functions can potentially be dysregulated, laying ground for neurological disorders. Also, in a context of low magnesium availability in the brain, NMDA glutamate receptors, which are excitatory, may become excessively activated, and GABAA receptors, which are inhibitory, may become insufficiently activated; this can lead to neuronal hyperactivity and to a condition known as glutamate excitotoxicity. This causes an excessive accumulation of calcium in neurons, which in turn leads to the production of toxic reactive oxygen species and, ultimately, to neuronal cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium deficiency has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including migraine, epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, stress, and neurodegenerative diseases. Magnesium supplementation has shown beneficial effects on many of these conditions, as well as in post-stroke, post-traumatic &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/01/traumatic-brain-injury-can-deep-sleep-be-neuroprotective/&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, and post-spinal cord injury therapies. This therapeutic action is likely due to its action in blocking NMDA glutamate receptors and decreasing excitotoxicity, in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and in increasing blood flow to the brain, all of which are determinant in the outcome of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple benefits to be obtained from magnesium, both from a health promotion, and from a disease prevention and management perspective. The recommended daily intake of magnesium is of 320mg for females and 420mg for males. Too much magnesium from food sources has no associated health risks in healthy individuals because the kidneys readily eliminate the excess. However, there is a recommended upper intake level for supplemental magnesium, since it can cause gastrointestinal side effects. So, keep it below 350mg/day.&lt;br /&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: The great misunderstanding about peer review and the nature of scientific facts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1430</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/the-great-misunderstanding-about-peer-review-and-the-nature-of-scientific-facts/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I organized a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computational-neuroscience-of-sensory-systems.org/workshop-on-emerging-models-in-scientific-communication-and-discussion/&quot;&gt;workshop on the future of academic publication&lt;/a&gt;. My point was that our current system, based on private pre-publication peer review, is archaic. I noted that the way the peer review system is currently organized (where external reviewers judge both the quality of the science and the interest for the journal) represents just a few decades in the history of science. It can hardly qualify as the way science is or should be done. It is a historical feature. For example, only one of Einstein’s papers was formally peer-reviewed; Crick &amp;amp; Watson’s DNA paper was not formally peer-reviewed. Many journals introduced external peer review in the 1960s or 1970s to deal with the growth in the number and variety of submissions (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528400/&quot;&gt;Baldwin, 2015&lt;/a&gt;); before that, editors would decide whether to publish the papers they received, depending on the number of pages they could print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the possibilities that offers the internet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-vision-of-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;it seems that there is no reason anymore to couple t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-vision-of-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;he two current roles of peer review&lt;/a&gt;: editorial selection and scientific discussion. One could simply share their work online, get feedback from the community to discuss the work, and then let people recommend papers to their colleagues and &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/free-the-journals/&quot;&gt;compile all sorts of reader’s digests&lt;/a&gt;. No time wasted in multiple submissions, no prestige misattributed to publications in glamour journals, who do not do a better a job than any other journal at pointing errors and frauds. Just the science and the public discussion of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a lot of resistance to this idea, namely the idea that papers should be formally approved by peer reviewers before they are published. Because otherwise, so many people claim, the scientific world would be polluted by all sorts of unverified claims. It would not be science anymore, just gossip. I have attributed this attitude to conservatism, first because as noted above this system is a rather recent addition to the scientific enterprise, and second because papers &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; published before peer review. We call those “preprints”, but really these are scientific papers made public, so by definition they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; published. I follow the preprints in my field and I don’t see any particular loss in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think I was missing a key element. The more profound reason why many people, in particular experimental biologists, are so attached to peer review is in my view that they hold naive philosophical views about the notion of truth in science. A paper should be peer-reviewed because otherwise you can’t cite it as a true fact. Peer review validates science, thanks to experts who make sure that the claims of the authors are actually true. Of course it can go wrong and reviewers might miss something, but it is the purpose of peer review. This view is reflected in the tendency, especially in biology journals, to choose titles that look like established truths: “Hunger is controlled by HGRase”, instead of “The molecular control of hunger”. Scientists and journalists can then write revealed truths with a verse reference, such as “Hunger is controlled by HGRase (McDonald et al., 2017)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great misunderstanding is that truth is a notion that applies to logical propositions (for example, mathematical theorems), not to empirical claims. This has been well argued by Popper, for example. Truth is by nature a theoretical concept. Everything said is said with words, and in this sense it always refers to theoretical concepts. One can only judge whether observations are congruent with the meaning attributed to the words, and that meaning necessarily has a theoretical nature. There is no such thing as an “established fact”. This is so even of what we might consider as direct observations. Take for example the claim “The resting potential of neurons is -70 mV”. This is a theoretical statement. Why? First, because to establish it, I have recorded a number of neurons. If you test it, it will be on a different neuron, which I have not measured. So I am making a theoretical claim. Probably, I also tested my neurons with a particular method (not mentioning a particular region and species). But my claim makes no reference to the method by which I have made the inference. That would be the “methods” part of my paper, not the conclusion, and when you cite my paper, you will cite it because of the conclusion, the “established fact”, you will not be referring to the methods, which you consider are the means to establish the fact. It is the role of the reviewers to check the methods, to check that they do establish the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are trivial remarks. It is not just that the method matters. The very notion of an observation always implicitly relies on a theoretical background. When I say that the resting potential is -70 mV, I mean that there is a potential difference of -70 mV across the membrane. But that’s not what I measure. I measure the difference in potential between some point outside the cell and the inside of a patch pipette whose solution is in contact with the cell’s inside. So I am assuming the potential is the same in all points of the cytosol, even though I have not tested it. I am also implicitly modeling the cytosol as a solution, even though the reality is more complex than that, given the mass of charged proteins in it. I am assuming that the extracellular potential is constant. I am assuming that my pipette solution reasonably matches the actual cytosol solution, given that “solution” is only a convenient model. I am implicitly making all sorts of theoretical assumptions, which have a lot of empirical support but are still of a theoretical nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried with this example to show that even a very simple “fact” is actually a theoretical proposition, with many layers of assumptions. But of course in general, papers typically make claims that rely less firmly on accepted theoretical grounds, since they must be “novel”. So it is never the case that a paper definitely proves its conclusions. Because conclusions have a theoretical nature, all that can be checked is whether observations are consistent with the authors’ interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the goal of peer review can’t be to establish the truth. If it were the case, then why would reviewers ever disagree? They disagree because they cannot actually judge whether a claim is true; they can only say whether they are personally convinced. This makes the current peer review system extremely poor, because all the information we get is: two anonymous people were convinced (and maybe others were not, but we’ll never find out). What would be more useful would be to have an open public discussion, with criticisms, qualifications and alternative interpretations fully disclosed for anyone to read and make their own opinion. In such a system, the notion of a stamp of approval on a paper would simply be absurd; why hide the disapprovals? There is the paper, and there is the scientific discussion of the paper, and that is all there needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some concern these days that peer reviewed research is unreliable. Well, science is unreliable. That is almost what defines it: it can be criticized and revised. Seeing peer review as the system that establishes the scientific truth is not only a historical error, it is a great philosophical error, and a dangerous bureaucratic view of science. We don’t need editorial decisions based on peer review. We need free publication (&lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;we have it&lt;/a&gt;) and we need open scientific discussion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/&quot;&gt;it’s coming&lt;/a&gt;). That’s all we need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I was at primary school, we used to type out the word “BOOBIES” using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_spelling&quot;&gt;upside-down digits&lt;/a&gt; on our electronic calculators and we thought it was hilarious. This was an all-boys school in the late 80s, cut us some slack. And anyway, maybe we weren’t so daft. The word (although spelt differently as “Booby”) was among the top-three most funny words as identified in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-017-0930-6&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research&lt;/em&gt;, which is the first in-depth investigation of the perceived funniness of individual English words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 5000 words that were studied, Booty was rated the funniest of all, scoring 4.32 on average on a scale from 1 (not funny at all) to 5 (most funny). The lowest scoring word was Rape with an average of 1.18. The researchers Tomas Engelthaler and Thomas Hills at the University of Warwick, England hope their findings will provide a useful resource, a “highly rudimentary ‘fruit fly’ version” of humour” for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-26/edition-4/how-many-psychologists-does-it-take-explain-joke&quot;&gt;researchers studying the psychology of what makes us laugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27334&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 821 participants for the study (average age 35; 58 per cent were female) were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online survey website. To ease them into the challenge, they each began by rating 11 “calibrator words” selected from pilot research because they’d attracted a wide range of funniness scores from high (Turd, scored at 3.78 in pilot research) to low (Drought, scored 1.13). After this, each participant rated the funniness of  approximately 200 more words selected at random from the 5000-word pool (taken from earlier studies into the subjective perception of English words). Participants were instructed to make their ratings based on their first and immediate reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 words to attract the highest funniness ratings were, in descending order from most funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booty, Tit, Booby, Hooter, Nitwit, Twit, Waddle, Tinkle, Bebop, Egghead, Ass and Twerp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 words to attract the lowest funniness ratings were, starting with the most humourless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rape, Torture, Torment, Gunshot, Death, Nightmare, War, Trauma, Rapist, Distrust, Deathbed, Pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers main objective was to create a useful data-set for future experiments into humour (similar to how others have created average ratings of concreteness, arousal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/18/why-do-so-many-people-dislike-the-word-moist/&quot;&gt;pleasantness&lt;/a&gt; and age-of-acquisition for other words), but they did perform a few comparisons with their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the researchers looked at the words for which men and women most strongly differed in the funniness ratings they gave, including the following which were rated funnier on average by men than women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bondage, Birthmark, Orgy, Brand, Chauffeur, Doze, Buzzard, Czar, Weld, Prod, Corn, Raccoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the following words, which were rated as funnier by women than men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giggle, Beast, Circus, Grand, Juju, Humbug, Slicker, Sweat, Ennui, Holder, Momma, Sod&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the following words were those that attracted the most similar high funniness ratings across both sexes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chug, Fluff, Scrotum, Jabber, Joke, Buttocks, Boon, Yank, Tinker, Prance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the words that tended to attract high funniness ratings and seeing how they have scored for other dimensions in previous research, Engelthaler and Hills found that they tended to be less frequent and to take people longer to recognise as words. Another thing: whereas previous research has found that we tend to have a positive bias towards words, finding most of them to be positive in tone and meaning, the current research found that we have a bias toward seeing most words as more unfunny than funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, time for me to stop all this jabber, I’m going to waddle off for a tinkle.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: In vivo FRET–FLIM reveals cell-type-specific protein interactions in Arabidopsis roots</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 During multicellular development, specification of distinct cell fates is often regulated by the same transcription factors operating differently in distinct cis-regulatory modules, either through different protein complexes, conformational modification of protein complexes, or combinations of both. Direct visualization of different transcription factor complex states guiding specific gene expression programs has been challenging. Here we use in vivo FRET–FLIM (Förster resonance energy transfer measured by fluorescence lifetime microscopy) to reveal spatial partitioning of protein interactions in relation to specification of cell fate. We show that, in Arabidopsis roots, three fully functional fluorescently tagged cell fate regulators establish cell-type-specific interactions at endogenous expression levels and can form higher order complexes. We reveal that cell-type-specific in vivo FRET–FLIM distributions reflect conformational changes of these complexes to differentially regulate target genes and specify distinct cell fates.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Derivation of ground-state female ES cells maintaining gamete-derived DNA methylation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Inhibitors of Mek1/2 and Gsk3β, known as 2i, enhance the derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and promote ground-state pluripotency in rodents. Here we show that the derivation of female mouse ES cells in the presence of 2i and leukaemia inhibitory factor (2i/L ES cells) results in a widespread loss of DNA methylation, including a massive erasure of genomic imprints. Despite this global loss of DNA methylation, early-passage 2i/L ES cells efficiently differentiate into somatic cells, and this process requires genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. However, the majority of imprinting control regions (ICRs) remain unmethylated in 2i/L-ES-cell-derived differentiated cells. Consistently, 2i/L ES cells exhibit impaired autonomous embryonic and placental development by tetraploid embryo complementation or nuclear transplantation. We identified the derivation conditions of female ES cells that display 2i/L-ES-cell-like transcriptional signatures while preserving gamete-derived DNA methylation and autonomous developmental potential. Upon prolonged culture, however, female ES cells exhibited ICR demethylation regardless of culture conditions. Our results provide insights into the derivation of female ES cells reminiscent of the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Stimulation of functional neuronal regeneration from Müller glia in adult mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23283</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Many retinal diseases lead to the loss of retinal neurons and cause visual impairment. The adult mammalian retina has little capacity for regeneration. By contrast, teleost fish functionally regenerate their retina following injury, and Müller glia (MG) are the source of regenerated neurons. The proneural transcription factor Ascl1 is upregulated in MG after retinal damage in zebrafish and is necessary for regeneration. Although Ascl1 is not expressed in mammalian MG after injury, forced expression of Ascl1 in mouse MG induces a neurogenic state in vitro and in vivo after NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) damage in young mice. However, by postnatal day 16, mouse MG lose neurogenic capacity, despite Ascl1 overexpression. Loss of neurogenic capacity in mature MG is accompanied by reduced chromatin accessibility, suggesting that epigenetic factors limit regeneration. Here we show that MG-specific overexpression of Ascl1, together with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enables adult mice to generate neurons from MG after retinal injury. The MG-derived neurons express markers of inner retinal neurons, synapse with host retinal neurons, and respond to light. Using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC–seq), we show that the histone deacetylase inhibitor promotes accessibility at key gene loci in the MG, and allows more effective reprogramming. Our results thus provide a new approach for the treatment of blinding retinal diseases.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Hypothalamic stem cells control ageing speed partly through exosomal miRNAs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 It has been proposed that the hypothalamus helps to control ageing, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here we develop several mouse models in which hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that co-express Sox2 and Bmi1 are ablated, as we observed that ageing in mice started with a substantial loss of these hypothalamic cells. Each mouse model consistently displayed acceleration of ageing-like physiological changes or a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing retardation and lifespan extension were achieved in mid-aged mice that were locally implanted with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that had been genetically engineered to survive in the ageing-related hypothalamic inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells contributed greatly to exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and these exosomal miRNAs declined during ageing, whereas central treatment with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cell-secreted exosomes led to the slowing of ageing. In conclusion, ageing speed is substantially controlled by hypothalamic stem cells, partially through the release of exosomal miRNAs.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Prolonged Mek1/2 suppression impairs the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23274</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Concomitant activation of the Wnt pathway and suppression of Mapk signalling by two small molecule inhibitors (2i) in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (hereafter termed 2i/L) induces a naive state in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that resembles the inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation embryo. Since the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how sustained propagation of naive ES cells in vitro affects their stability and functionality. Here we show that prolonged culture of male mouse ES cells in 2i/L results in irreversible epigenetic and genomic changes that impair their developmental potential. Furthermore, we find that female ES cells cultured in conventional serum plus LIF medium phenocopy male ES cells cultured in 2i/L. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Mek1/2 is predominantly responsible for these effects, in part through the downregulation of DNA methyltransferases and their cofactors. Finally, we show that replacement of the Mek1/2 inhibitor with a Src inhibitor preserves the epigenetic and genomic integrity as well as the developmental potential of ES cells. Taken together, our data suggest that, although short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ES cells helps to maintain an ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes that compromise their developmental potential.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Higher-order interactions stabilize dynamics in competitive network models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23273</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species’ abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Complex cellular logic computation using ribocomputing devices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23271</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Synthetic biology aims to develop engineering-driven approaches to the programming of cellular functions that could yield transformative technologies. Synthetic gene circuits that combine DNA, protein, and RNA components have demonstrated a range of functions such as bistability, oscillation, feedback, and logic capabilities. However, it remains challenging to scale up these circuits owing to the limited number of designable, orthogonal, high-performance parts, the empirical and often tedious composition rules, and the requirements for substantial resources for encoding and operation. Here, we report a strategy for constructing RNA-only nanodevices to evaluate complex logic in living cells. Our ‘ribocomputing’ systems are composed of de-novo-designed parts and operate through predictable and designable base-pairing rules, allowing the effective in silico design of computing devices with prescribed configurations and functions in complex cellular environments. These devices operate at the post-transcriptional level and use an extended RNA transcript to co-localize all circuit sensing, computation, signal transduction, and output elements in the same self-assembled molecular complex, which reduces diffusion-mediated signal losses, lowers metabolic cost, and improves circuit reliability. We demonstrate that ribocomputing devices in Escherichia coli can evaluate two-input logic with a dynamic range up to 900-fold and scale them to four-input AND, six-input OR, and a complex 12-input expression (A1 AND A2 AND NOT A1*) OR (B1 AND B2 AND NOT B2*) OR (C1 AND C2) OR (D1 AND D2) OR (E1 AND E2). Successful operation of ribocomputing devices based on programmable RNA interactions suggests that systems employing the same design principles could be implemented in other host organisms or in extracellular settings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Hundreds of thousands of human genomes are now being sequenced to characterize genetic variation and use this information to augment association mapping studies of complex disorders and other phenotypic traits. Genetic variation is identified mainly by mapping short reads to the reference genome or by performing local assembly. However, these approaches are biased against discovery of structural variants and variation in the more complex parts of the genome. Hence, large-scale de novo assembly is needed. Here we show that it is possible to construct excellent de novo assemblies from high-coverage sequencing with mate-pair libraries extending up to 20 kilobases. We report de novo assemblies of 150 individuals (50 trios) from the GenomeDenmark project. The quality of these assemblies is similar to those obtained using the more expensive long-read technology. We use the assemblies to identify a rich set of structural variants including many novel insertions and demonstrate how this variant catalogue enables further deciphering of known association mapping signals. We leverage the assemblies to provide 100 completely resolved major histocompatibility complex haplotypes and to resolve major parts of the Y chromosome. Our study provides a regional reference genome that we expect will improve the power of future association mapping studies and hence pave the way for precision medicine initiatives, which now are being launched in many countries including Denmark.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, we know: It’s easy to publish “fake” papers in journals and expose the inherent flaws of academic publishing. We’ve covered many such stings, but there are simply too many for us to cover all.  Still, occasionally one is just too clever to ignore. On Saturday, the pseudonymous blogger Neuroskeptic announced that they had […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry journals have retracted two papers evaluating a schizophrenia drug after a university in Japan flagged issues, such as a lack of written informed consent. The papers—published in Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical &amp;amp; Experimental in 2012 and Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences in 2014—examined the safety and effectiveness of an antipsychotic drug in patients with schizophrenia. According […]&lt;/p&gt;
