&lt;p&gt;“Microaggressions” are seemingly innocuous words or behaviour that supposedly communicate a bias toward minority groups, such as asking Asian Americans where they are from, implying that they are not really part of the USA. According to advocates of the usefulness of the concept, microaggressions cause real harm, even if unintended by the perpetrator. However, the theoretical and evidential support for the concept of microaggressions is far from clear, as detailed in Scott Lilienfeld’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/16/the-scientific-evidence-for-microaggressions-is-weak-and-we-should-drop-the-term-argues-review-author/&quot;&gt;thorough critique&lt;/a&gt;, which recommended the term be revised or at least re-examined. Now, Craig Harper, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University, has published a study as &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/973v8/&quot;&gt;a pre-print online at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; that, he argues, reveals a further key problem with the concept of the microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33032&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it’s usually defined, a microaggression only counts as such when a &lt;i&gt;majority&lt;/i&gt; group member commits an act that a &lt;i&gt;minority&lt;/i&gt; group member perceives as a slight. The term was coined to account for slights against Black people, and has since expanded to other groups. On his &lt;em&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/em&gt; blog, Derald Sue at Columbia University, one of the originators of the microaggression concept, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201011/microaggressions-more-just-race&quot;&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; microaggressions are “everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that … target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership”. For his new study, Craig Harper’s aim was to examine whether it’s true that the experience of “being microaggressed at” really does only flow in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper recruited around 400 US participants online and split them into three groups according to their political beliefs: conservative, liberal, or moderate. They also answered questions about their pride in belonging to their political grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants then read six fictional scenarios in which a professor made a contentious claim to his students. For example, in one, a male professor explained that the reason women are under-represented in certain professions is entirely due to their personal choice. A female student then responded in a frustrated manner, but was told by the professor to calm down and that this was not a place for “policy agendas.” This is a fairly typical example of what the literature considers a microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the scenarios were balanced so only half the microaggressions targeted people who would normally be seen as victims: women, Black people, and liberals. The other three scenarios kept the topics (such as educational attainment and political diversity), but switched the social identities of the perpetrator and victim. For example, in one case, a female professor justified lower rates of men in certain professions and then showed impatience towards a male student who complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading each scenario, the participants said whether they thought the student was right to feel insulted or had been overly sensitive. They also said whether they thought the professor was bigoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly perhaps, the students’ own political orientation shaped their response. Harper found that political liberals judged the fictional professors more harshly when they targeted racial minorities, women and those on the political left, compared to other targets. The students with more conservative leanings were less bothered by the scenario content overall, but showed the opposite pattern, being more critical when majorities, men and conservatives were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper says this is important because it shows, contrary to the the conventional definition of the microaggression concept, that microaggressions aren’t only experienced by those who fall into certain minority political categories. Instead it seems that anyone who thinks their in-group has been slighted by an out-group member may feel as if they’ve been “microaggressed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly relevant to one’s sensitivity to potential microaggressions, according to Harper,  is the concept of “collective narcissism” – how much we believe in the superiority of our in-group (typified by agreement with statements like “If people with my political views had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place”). Based on the participants’ ratings of their pride in their political in-group, there wasn’t any evidence this factor mattered for the liberal groups’ perception of microaggressions. For some of the conservative participants, however, it was those showing more collective narcissism who showed greater sensitivity to slighted right-wing targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding for collective narcissism is tentative at this stage. In fact, Harper’s paper has not yet been peer reviewed and there may be further interpretations of the results that Harper hasn’t considered. But it seems clear that once you are willing to put aside the lens of power to understand microaggressions, you can study the concept like other forms of motivated social cognition we understand quite well, such as, Harper says, the tendency “to shun or discredit those with whom we are ideologically opposed”. These new findings suggest that those who argue microaggressions are a societal concern specifically afflicting minorities may have to recognise that other interest groups – especially in spaces that lean left, not right, like most universities – will have a claim to play the same game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s widely accepted children’s development reflects an interaction between their genes and the environment they are raised in. More tentative is the intriguing idea that the role of the environment is more consequential for some children than others. According to this view, a minority of children are environmentally sensitive “orchids” who suffer disproportionately in adversity, but who especially thrive in positive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, research into this idea has been stifled by the lack of a short, reliable test of children’s Environmental Sensitivity. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-42386-001&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Michael Pluess at Queen Mary University of London has now developed a 12-item scale for this purpose. Preliminary work using the test supports the importance of the Environmental Sensitivity concept and suggests children fall into three groups: orchids; dandelions, who are relatively unaffected by the environment; and tulips, who are midway between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33019&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers started by asking over 300 children aged 11 to 14 years, at a school in East London, to complete an established adult measure of Environmental Sensitivity. Based on the children’s answers, the researchers removed unnecessary items and whittled the measure down to create a “Highly Sensitive Child” (HSC) test that asks children to rate how strongly they agree with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it unpleasant to have a lot going on at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some music can make me really happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loud noises make me feel uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am annoyed when people try to get me to do too many things at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notice it when small things have changed in my environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get nervous when I have to do a lot in little time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice smells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like watching TV programs that have a lot of violence in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like loud noises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like it when things change in my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone observes me, I get nervous. This makes me perform worse than normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers put their new test through its paces, by giving it, together with other personality measures, to  258 more children, aged 11-12 years, also at a school in East London; to 104 children (aged 8-11 years) at two London primary schools, who took the new test twice, several weeks apart; and to nearly 1,500 teenagers from across England and Wales, aged 15-19 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from these tests showed that like the adult version of the test, the new test appears to tap three separate factors (Aesthetic sensitivity; Ease of Excitation; and Low Sensory Threshold) that correlate and contribute to a general trait of Environmental Sensitivity. Importantly, Environmental Sensitivity appeared to be distinct from other traits already established in psychology, such as trait Neuroticism (or emotional instability). There was also notable stability in their Environmental Sensitivity scores when children took the test twice, weeks apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final analysis, the researchers combined all their data and looked to see whether the distribution of Environmental Sensitivity scores supported the idea that a minority of children are orchids, while the majority are “dandelions” and less sensitive to the environment, positive or negative. In fact, the new data suggested that scores tend to fall into three groupings, with roughly 30 per cent of children matching the environmentally sensitive “orchid” category, 30 per cent being “dandelions” and showing a distinct lack of Environmental Sensitivity, and the remainder being “tulips”, midway between the two other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is need to test the reality of these categories and how they differ from each other, or whether it might actually be more accurate to see variation in Environmental Sensitivity as an unbroken continuum. It will also be interesting to see whether and how patterns of Environmental Sensitivity vary across cultures, and what are the factors that influence a child’s score on the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s already exciting from a practical and theoretical perspective, though, is that early research (conducted separately from the current study) using the new Highly Sensitive Child test, suggests that Environmental Sensitivity is a meaningful concept with important implications. For instance, a long-term study in the US of juvenile offenders (currently unpublished) found that risk of re-offending was more strongly related to quality of the home environment, good and bad, among those who scored high on Environmental Sensitivity. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-51819-001&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that both positive and negative parenting styles were more consequential for children rated higher by their parents on Environmental Sensitivity (using an adapted version of the new HSC test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Environmental Sensitivity is an important individual characteristic that is related to, but largely distinct from, other common temperament and personality traits,” the researchers said. “The current study suggests that it is possible to measure Environmental Sensitivity reliably in children and adolescents with the Highly Sensitive Child scale, a 12-item self-report measure with good psychometric properties.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Getting a good night’s sleep before doing the housework</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9746</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/01/11/getting-a-good-nights-sleep-before-doing-the-housework/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/cleaning-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Household activities are a core part of the daily lives of retirees. Previous work has found that this population devotes more time to housework activities than their working spouses and this has become more pronounced since the increase in life expectancy and subsequently the increase in time spent not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, men tend to still avoid the washing up, even post retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9750 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/garden-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In their study just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at &lt;em&gt;Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen&lt;/em&gt; found notable differences between the type of housework men and women spent time on. Across all countries included in this study, men spent less time cleaning, cooking and shopping than women (88.7 minutes a day compared to 217.9 minutes a day). However, women were found to spend less time on gardening and maintenance tasks than men (38.5 minutes a day compared to 68.8 minutes a day). This supports previous work which shows that women are more likely to engage in routine, every-day chores compared to their spouses who are more involved in occasional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also carried out a cross-country comparison among Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. They found that elderly women in Italy and Germany spent the most time on housework (around five hours a day), while women in the US spent the least amount of time doing housework (four hours a day). In contrast, elderly men in Italy spent the least amount of time on housework (2.7 hours a day) and German men spent the most time on housework (4.2 hours a day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sleep constituting the lengthiest time use activity among the elderly, the authors also set out to address to what extent the association between housework activities and health is moderated by sleep hours among men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the study used self-reported data from 15,333 men and 20,907 women aged 65 years and over from Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. Participants reported the total time they spent per day on 41 activities in 5, 10 or 15-minute intervals. They also reported the total amount of time they spent sleeping per day, as well as whether they felt they were in poor, fair, good or very good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.  Conversely, for men, long hours of housework was associated with good health status regardless of sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: A five-day guide to resiliency in the New Year</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135987</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/516392590/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/busyness-status-symbol/518178/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;world that values busyness&lt;/a&gt;, it is often easy to prioritize personal responsibilities over personal fulfillment. Phrases like I wish I had the time and once things settle down justify an all-too-common postponement of happiness and self-care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/night-call-9780190669638&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Call&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, acclaimed psychologist  and author Robert Wicks details a five-day guide to self-care designed to fit even the busiest of schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day one: savor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; alone time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time alone or within ourselves— “alone time”—needs to be appreciated in the broadest sense (not just in the extreme where someone goes off by him- or-herself to an isolated spot) in the living opportunities that present themselves during our current normal daily routines. When alone time is appreciated, explored, and enjoyed in the right way, we can lessen our projections, become easier on ourselves, and decrease our discouragement when immediate gratification or success isn’t granted. Instead, we may feel a sense of inner ease and intrigue about the life we can live that is before us right now rather than constantly being postponed into some uncertain future. As we can see in the following reflection by Christopher Peterson, the author of &lt;em&gt;A Primer in Positive Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, life need not, should not, be postponed— even for apparently practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many academics, I spent my young adult years post­poning many of the small things that I knew would make me happy, including reading novels for pleasure, learning to cook, taking a photography class, and joining a gym. I would do all of these things when I had time— when I fin­ished school, when I was awarded tenure, and so on. I was fortunate enough to realize that I would never have time unless I made the time. And then the rest of my life began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day two: replenishing yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeds of &lt;em&gt;secondary &lt;/em&gt;stress (the pressures experienced in reaching out to others in distress) and the seeds of true pas­sionate involvement are actually the &lt;em&gt;same &lt;/em&gt;seeds&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Once again, the question is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;whether stress will appear and take a toll on those seeking to be compassionate and caring. Instead, it is to what extent we take the essential steps to appreciate, limit, and learn from this very stress to continue— and even deepen— our personal lives and roles as helpers and healers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To renew themselves on an ongoing basis, there are basic elements of a self-care protocol that most everyone needs. Some of the basic elements might include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiet walks by yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time and space for meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiritual and recreational reading, including the diaries and biographies of others whom you admire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some light exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities to laugh offered by movies, cheerful friends, and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hobby, such as gardening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls to family and friends who inspire and tease you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involvement in projects that renew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to music you enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day three: debriefing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For therapists and counselors, a daily review or self-debriefing helps them get in touch with the feelings they have had in their treatment sessions. They seek to discover if their intense encounters with the persons they serve triggered dis­torted thoughts and beliefs. By looking at their own reactions, they not only learn things about themselves but also appreciate the people and situations they encounter in new ways. Such a review would benefit all of us even if we are not in the helping or healing professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more detail the process of a structured reflection or self-debriefing, which could be modified according to individual needs, includes the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick events during the day that stand out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter into the event and describe what happened (the objective) and how you feel (the subjective)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the temptation to be discouraged, blame others (projection) or yourself (self- condemnation); instead, see what you can learn from the event about yourself and your vulnerabilities, needs, addictions, fears, anxieties, worries, and desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on these insights in light of what you believe (your philosophy, psychology, ethics, and/ or spirituality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide how these insights should change you personally, interpersonally, and professionally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alter the way you behave in light of these new insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day four: attending to mindlessness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see and embrace mindfulness in an ongoing way, not only do we benefit, but those who we reach out to in life do as well. For example, it allows us to be more perceptive concerning what is present in ourselves and others without judgment so we can experience situations more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this in reflecting on our lives or in medi­tation, we need to approach ourselves with no preconceived notions of what will happen or a “gaining idea” in our minds as to something we wish to achieve. Consequently, recogniz­ing the following types of mindless behavior and attitudes as persons wishing to honor our caregiving roles as well as the need of self-compassion is a good beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting too easily upset—often over the wrong things (fail­ing to be successful even after we have been faithful to doing what we can) and missing what life is offering us in all inter­actions and events (an opportunity to learn from our reac­tions and as well as information from outside ourselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing interruptions only as disruptive rather than as infor­mative or possible, unexpected opportunities to see or expe­rience something new and differently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possessing habits and rules that continue to sap life’s freshness for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time in the silver casket of nostalgia or rushing through precious moments of our lives under the impression that living this way is “only practical” and temporary, although these “temporaries” can link together to form a lifetime of mindlessness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only fantasizing about both “the spirit of simplicity” and “letting go” rather than seeking to instill them in our own lives in real, concrete ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day five: friendship and journeys in letting go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us go through periods when we feel left by ourselves, without “friendly forces” to help us gain perspective and know we are worthwhile, competent, secure, and (maybe most of all) understood. Margaret Mead, the famous anthropolo­gist once said that “one of the oldest human needs is having someone to wonder where you are when you don’t come home at night.” Sometimes friendship implodes our sense of “lost­ness” during a dramatic event in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go means catching ourselves in the act of holding on to a feeling or reaction that is not from a good place within ourselves. A psychotherapist once shared with me, “When I find myself being tempted to be small-minded or mean-spirited, I remind myself of the invitation to be magnanimous, where I find my better self.” This better self is one that is more open, one that doesn’t deny difficulties but also doesn’t see things in polarities of right and wrong or good and bad. The better self is able to be receptive to a richer and more nuanced experience of life, and this is certainly a place where friendship can support such an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

Curiously, the negative emotion ratings on exclusion trials did not differ between the Self, Objectified, and Personalized conditions. &lt;span style=&quot;color: magenta;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;So there appears to be no empathy gap for objectified women who were excluded from Cyberball&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The difference was on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;inclusion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; trials, when the subjects didn't feel as positively towards women in little black dresses when they were &lt;i&gt;included&lt;/i&gt; in the game (in comparison to when women in pants were included, or when they themselves were included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PYFobuxzPQ0/WlX-0TnuRyI/AAAAAAAAMaY/b1tn7noDWUomyyKu6gpb3M_j2QAK1LzrQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig3_Cogoni_no%2Bcaption.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;587&quot; data-original-width=&quot;866&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PYFobuxzPQ0/WlX-0TnuRyI/AAAAAAAAMaY/b1tn7noDWUomyyKu6gpb3M_j2QAK1LzrQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig3_Cogoni_no%2Bcaption.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217304045&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cogoni et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I won't delve deeper into the neuroimaging results, because the differences shown at the top of the post were for the exclusion condition, when behavioral ratings were the all same.

At any rate, perhaps an fMRI study of perpetrators would be more informative in the future. But ultimately, culture and social conditions and power differentials (all outside the brain) are the major determinants of violence against women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DyADFjADJ0o/WlXtKswqkkI/AAAAAAAAMZ8/8vTT_PD9HGMaqNjen98vhPJ6KH4v0lZwwCLcBGAs/s1600/Abuse%2Bof%2BPower%2BComes%2BAs%2BNo%2BSurprise.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;269&quot; data-original-width=&quot;444&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DyADFjADJ0o/WlXtKswqkkI/AAAAAAAAMZ8/8vTT_PD9HGMaqNjen98vhPJ6KH4v0lZwwCLcBGAs/s320/Abuse%2Bof%2BPower%2BComes%2BAs%2BNo%2BSurprise.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~field/holzer/truisms.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Truisms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.jennyholzer.com/projections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny Holzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When discussing the objectification of women in the present era, it's hard to escape the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/27/weinstein-scandal-complete-list-accusers/804663001/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;84 accusers!!&quot;&gt;Harvey Weinstein scandal&lt;/a&gt;.

I  quickly realized that a large portion of the town functioned inside a  soft and sometimes literal trafficking or prostitution of young women (a  commodity with an endless supply and an endless demand). The  storytellers—the people with economic and artistic power—are, by and  large, straight, white men. As of 2017, women make up only 23 percent of  the Directors Guild of America and only 11 percent are people of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, when I was standing in line for some open-call audition for a  horror film, I remember catching my reflection in the mirror and  realizing that I was dressed like a sex object. Every woman in line to  audition for “Nurse” was, it seemed. We had all internalized on some  level the idea that if we were going to be cast we’d better sell what  was desired—not our artistry, not our imaginations—but our bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/dacher-keltner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dacher Keltner&lt;/a&gt; wrote about empathy deficits of the rich and famous in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/10/sex-power-and-the-systems-that-enable-men-like-harvey-weinstein&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sex, Power, and the Systems That Enable Men Like Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.

Arabs Culture Foundation (FUNCA) called for a demonstration with the support of more than fifty mosques under the slogan 'Against terrorism and radicalisms' in reaction to several terrorist attacks that started inside Charlie Hebdo magazine's office, and had taken the lives of seventeen people and three suspects in Paris this week.

&lt;p&gt;Terror attacks by Muslim extremists tend to provoke hate crimes in response. After the London Bridge and Borough market attacks in 2017, and the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, for example, there was a spike in the number of reports of verbal and physical attacks on innocent Muslims. Two weeks after the London Bridge attacks, a British non-Muslim man even drove his van into worshippers leaving the Finsbury Park Mosque in London, killing one and injuring 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have a tendency to hold groups collectively responsible for the actions of individual group members, which justifies ‘vicarious retribution’ against any group member to exact revenge,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217744197&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; that explores how to short-circuit this cycle of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what the researchers dub an “interventions tournament”, they tried out various methods of reducing the collective blaming of all Muslims for attacks by individual extremists. Most failed. But there was one clear winner: an intervention that encouraged non-Muslims to see the hypocrisy in blaming all Muslims for the appalling actions of a few individuals, but not all Christians for the violent actions of an extremist few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33010&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania led the work, beginning with a study of the importance of collective blaming, involving 193 mostly white, Christian Americans, recruited online. As they predicted, the researchers found that those participants who held Muslims collectively responsible for the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015 were also more likely to endorse a suite of anti-Muslim attitudes and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers selected eight 2-4 minute-long videos containing different psychological “elements” that might help reduce the belief in collective blame. For example, one of the videos highlighted the diversity of the Muslim experience – challenging the idea that “all Muslims are the same”. Two videos depicted non-Muslim Americans demonstrating that they do not hold Muslims collectively responsible for terror incidents – by donating to a vandalised mosque, for example. This kind of “social proof” has been shown in other studies to strongly influence behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,765 non-Muslim Americans watched one of these eight videos, or no video (as a control), or a “negative control” – a video interview with a Syrian-born woman who attacked Islam as backward and violent. This video was expected to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; collective blame, and the analysis showed that it did – highlighting, the researchers write, the potential danger of anti-Muslim rhetoric by politicians and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one video reduced collective blame. This was an Al Jazeera interview with a Muslim American woman who highlighted the hypocrisy of holding all Muslims collectively responsible for extremist violence. Specifically, she discussed the tendency by Christians to blame all Muslims for terror attacks, but not to blame all Christians for violent acts by extremist individual Christians. After watching this video, participants not only saw Muslims as less collectively responsible for extremism, but also showed less anti-Muslim prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether the key ingredient of this video was the way it highlighted hypocrisy, the researchers asked more participants to reflect on their own (and White people’s) &lt;i&gt;lack&lt;/i&gt; of collective responsibility for the actions of extreme individual group members, and they found this also lowered belief in the collective blame of Muslims, as well as reducing anti-Muslim prejudice, attitudes and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting, of course, to know how long the effects of a hypocrisy intervention might last in the real world. But, as the researchers note in their conclusion, the findings “contribute to a long tradition of research demonstrating that highlighting hypocrisy can drive behaviour change”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217744197&quot;&gt;Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a question that goes to the heart of human nature – do our personalities change through life or stay essentially the same? You might think psychology would have a definitive answer, but this remains an active research question. This is partly because of the practical challenge of testing the same group of individuals over many years. Now a major new contribution to the topic has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/ryjpc/&quot;&gt;made available online at the PsyArXiv repository&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers, led by Eileen Graham at Northwestern University, have compared and combined data from 14 previously published longitudinal studies, together involving nearly 50,000 participants from the US, Europe and Scandinavia. Their findings confirm and extend existing knowledge, showing how personality traits tend to change through life in predictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham and her colleagues started by looking for existing long-term studies into health and ageing that had captured data on at least one of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) on at least three separate occasions among the same sample of people. Although these long-term term studies measured personality, previous investigators hadn’t necessarily looked at this aspect of their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the identified studies that met the required criteria were the Einstein Aging Study, the Midlife in the United States study, The Berlin Aging Study, The Lothian Birth Cohort and the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. In some cases, personality data was collected from the same individuals over several decades. There was a bias in the included studies toward testing people late in life, but this helps counterbalance existing studies of lifetime personality change which have been skewed toward younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining data from all the studies showed that four of the five main personality traits showed statistically significant change, on average, through life, thus contradicting William James’ famous assertion that personality is set like plaster after age 30. The exception was trait Agreeableness (related to warmth and empathy), but actually this trait was found to change in each individual study, but in different directions for different studies (sometimes increasing through life, sometimes diminishing), such that it appeared stable when considered in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting Agreeableness aside, the overall pattern was for the other traits to decline across the lifespan by about 1-2 per cent per decade, such that participants became, on average, more emotionally stable (save for an uptick in Neuroticism at the very end of life), but generally less outgoing, less open-minded, and less orderly and self-disciplined. This is somewhat consistent with the previously described Dolce Vita (literally “sweet life”) effect, which describes how we change in late life in response to having fewer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth reiterating that there was a bias in the included studies towards older samples. Focusing on just those studies with younger participants also provided evidence for early life increases in Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Openness (with peaks occurring in mid-life), which is consistent with another established theory known as the “maturity principle”, which states that our personalities tend to improve through life as we adapt to the growing challenges of work and family responsibilities (the observed declines in Neuroticism also fit this picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember these findings relate to sample averages, based on how personality trait levels were seen to change when data from all participants was combined. Consistent with past research, results from 12 of the 14 analysed studies revealed a good deal of individual variation in these patterns. As Graham and her colleagues put it, “not everyone changes at the same rate, or in the same direction”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some intriguing hints at how these personality dynamics might vary across cultures. Specifically, the US samples showed more marked and consistent declines in Extraversion through life compared with European samples. The researchers interpreted this as US citizens becoming less inclined with age to conform to the strong pressure in American culture to behave like an extravert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings leave many questions about personality change unanswered, such as why some people show trait changes that don’t fit with the usual pattern. However, this paper’s most important contribution is probably to show how sub-fields like this, which depend on challenging, hard-to-repeat, long-term studies, can respond to the so-called replication crisis in psychology. It’s fairly easy to re-run a simple laboratory task with students, it’s much harder to try to replicate the findings of a decades-long personality change study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any one of the 14 samples used here could have comprised a publication on its own,” Graham and her colleagues explained, “with some claiming a given increase, other claiming a decrease, and still others arguing that a trait does not change at all. This has the potential to sow great confusion … However, when considered as a group with other samples, a fuller picture emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: Can we trust statistics in fMRI studies?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19499</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/-l952hwBYao/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/PLOS_fMRI-2-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of the most celebrated tools in neuroscience. Because of their unique ability to peer directly into the living brain while an organism thinks, feels and behaves, fMRI studies are often devoted disproportionate media attention, replete with flashy headlines and often grandiose claims. However, the technique has come under a fair amount of criticism from researchers questioning the validity of the statistical methods used to analyze fMRI data, and hence the reliability of fMRI findings. Can we trust those flashy headlines claiming that “scientists have discovered the &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;insert political affiliation, emotion or personality trait&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; area of the brain,” or are the masses of fMRI studies plagued by statistical shortcomings? To explore why these studies can be vulnerable to experimental failure, in their new &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184923&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS One study&lt;/a&gt; coauthors Henk Cremers, Tor Wager and Tal Yarkoni investigated common statistical issues encountered in typical fMRI studies, and proposed how to avert them moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMRI simulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliability of any experiment depends on adequate power to detect real effects and reject spurious ones, which can be influenced by various factors including the sample size (or number of “subjects” in fMRI), how strong the real effect is (“effect size”), whether comparisons are within or between subjects, and the statistical threshold used. To characterize common statistical culprits of fMRI studies, Cremers and colleagues first simulated typical fMRI scenarios before validating these simulations on a real dataset. One scenario simulated weak but diffusely distributed brain activity, and the other scenario simulated strong but localized brain activity (Figure 1). The simulation revealed that effect sizes are generally inflated for weak diffuse, compared to strong localized, activations, especially when the sample size is small. In contrast, effect sizes can actually be &lt;em&gt;underestimated&lt;/em&gt; for strong localized scenarios when the sample size is large. Thus, more isn’t always better when it comes to fMRI; the optimal sample size likely depends on the specific brain-behavior relationship under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19500&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19500 size-large&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017-1024x246.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Example “weak diffuse” and “strong localized” fMRI activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real data application: Human Connectome Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Cremers and colleagues analyzed a real fMRI dataset of nearly 500 subjects performing a social cognition task collected through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Human Connectome Project&lt;/a&gt;. To represent typical fMRI studies, random samples of 15 subjects were drawn to assess within-subject effects, and random samples of 30 subjects were used for between-subjects analyses. Results from these examples were compared to data from the full sample of 500 subjects—a rough proxy for true effects. Similar to the simulation, effect sizes negatively correlated with sample size, decreasing as the sample size grew. Because within-subject contrasts are by nature higher-powered, and because of the strong brain-behavior effect analyzed, real within-subject activations were readily detected even with the small sample of 15 individuals, resembling the simulated “strong localized” effects. In contrast, between-subject effects, even with twice the sample size, were unreliable and inflated, closely resembling the simulated “weak diffuse” scenario (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19501&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19501 size-full&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;. Eight random subsamples of data (N = 30) from the Human Connectome Project, showing unreliable between-subject activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a few key take-away lessons. Underpowered studies can result in grossly overestimated effects and inconsistent activations, leading to an inability to replicate results. In part driven by a common fear of Type I errors (false positives), many studies miss legitimate effects and thus encourage incomplete or inaccurate inferences about brain-behavior relationships. Wager underscores that these pitfalls aren’t entirely unique to fMRI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a healthy skepticism applies to most areas of science—genetics, animal models of disorders, psychology, and much more—not just fMRI. And I think skepticism should be &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; skepticism—we can get provisionally excited about published ideas, and more excited about them as they pass the test of time and begin to be replicated across more groups. Publishing an exploratory finding that may not be true is not wrong, if you’ve made a good faith attempt to get at the truth—we just have to have patience and not ‘over-believe’ until the evidence comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding statistical pitfalls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can a neuroscientist do to adequately power their fMRI experiment to detect true effects while minimizing false or unreliable effects? A power analysis using realistic parameter estimates to compute the necessary sample size is a critical first step. Unfortunately, the requisite sample of fMRI data may be prohibitive in terms of time and money for an individual researcher without access to large datasets. The growing trend in “big data” may partially address this problem, but, as Wager explains, “it’s even more important to have ‘smart data.’ Large datasets can produce spurious results with high confidence in many cases where hidden causes are not properly accounted for. Smart data means careful sampling and analysis to improve inferences about what the real causes of effects are.” Once the data have been collected, a researcher can optimize their analysis by selecting the right balance between Type I (false positives) and Type II (false negatives) errors, which largely depends on the unique study scenario. Finally, the number of statistical comparisons can be limited by employing hypothesis-driven testing or by taking advantage of machine-learning, graph theory, or data reduction approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A movement to standardize fMRI methods has recently emerged, propelled by papers including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2016/COBIDASreport.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the OHBM Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS) on MRI&lt;/a&gt; and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guidelines for reporting an fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;.” According to Cremers, such efforts are “indeed essential, since there are so many choices to make when it comes to data acquisition and analyses. Also, initiatives like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coursera fMRI course&lt;/a&gt; of Lindquist and Tor, are great and very important—they make the principles of fMRI research accessible to a wide audience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, so few people contracted measles in England and Wales that the disease was declared &lt;a href=&quot;http://%3Chttps://www.nhs.uk/news/pregnancy-and-child/has-measles-really-been-eradicated-in-the-uk/&quot;&gt;technically “eliminated”&lt;/a&gt;. The national MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccination programme is to thank. But set against this welcome news were some imperfect stats: in England in 2016/17, only 87.6 per cent of children had received both the required doses of the vaccine by their fifth birthday – a drop compared with the previous two years. At least part of the reason was a reluctance among some parents to have their children vaccinated. This is a problem that affects &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-vaccination-gaps-troubling-20170814-story.html&quot;&gt;other countries&lt;/a&gt;, and other vaccines, too. And it’s troubling, because clusters of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children are more susceptible to disease outbreaks – indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/24/call-for-all-children-to-receive-mmr-vaccine-after-measles-outbreak&quot;&gt;a measles outbreak in Leeds and Liverpool just last year affected unprotected children&lt;/a&gt;, providing a reminder why all children should be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0256-5&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, a team led by Avnika Amin at Emory University, US, reveal a previously overlooked explanation for “vaccine hesitancy”, as it’s called – and it’s to do with parents’ basic moral values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32999&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent interventions designed to improve childhood vaccination rates have focused on providing parents with facts about vaccines. But while educational campaigns of this kind can be successful in the short term, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/&quot;&gt;they can backfire,&lt;/a&gt; making some parents even less willing to vaccinate their children than they were before. This makes sense if you consider that parents’ decisions are not based only on the facts, but also on their moral values. By also addressing this influence on parents’ attitudes to vaccination, it may be possible to develop more effective interventions and help increase vaccination rates further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our moral values – the extent to which we prioritise loyalty or fairness, for example – are known to guide our decisions and behaviour in other areas, such as climate change and philanthropy. So the researchers reasoned that it made sense to look how they might influence attitudes towards vaccination. To do this, Amin and her colleagues surveyed 1,007 US parents of children aged under 13 about their attitudes to vaccination, and about their moral values, and looked to see if there was a connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost three quarters of parents fell into the “low hesitancy” category (they didn’t have a problem with vaccines); about 11 per cent were classed as “medium hesitancy” (they expressed concerns about vaccinations and had perhaps delayed their child’s vaccinations as a result); and 16 per cent were classed as “high hesitancy” (they had seriously delayed or even refused vaccinations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of their moral values, both medium and high-hesitancy parents were twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to place a high emphasis on “purity” (one of six “moral foundations”, purity is associated with disapproval of acts that are deemed “disgusting” or “unnatural”). The high-hesitancy parents were also twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to place a strong emphasis on liberty, which involves valuing individual freedom. They were also half as likely endorse obedience to authority. Belief in the importance of fairness (another moral foundation) was not related to vaccine hesitancy, and neither were gender or political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study, using a separate group of 464 parents, validated these findings. But the data from both studies only show a correlation between particular moral standpoints and attitudes towards childhood vaccinations, not a causal link. Nonetheless, the researchers said their results suggest that “health decisions are, to some extent, linked with moral concerns” and that there was promise in exploring the impact of health messages “framed using the moral foundations associated with medium or high hesitancy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, they suggested an intervention framed in terms of purity might read, “Boost your child’s natural defences against diseases! Keep your child pure of infections – Vaccinate!” A message framed in terms of liberty might read, “Take personal control of your child’s health! Vaccinations can help your child and others be free to lead a happy and healthy life!”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: A new take on the “ancient wing”</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Archaeopteryx_fossil-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;150 million years after Archaeopteryx roamed the earth; this bird-like dinosaur continues to be a source of fascination and debate. For over 100 years following its discovery in 1861, it had been considered the oldest known bird. Two years on from “On the Origin of Species”, the discovery of Archaeopteryx was well timed to provide physical evidence to support the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx derives its name from the Greek terms for “ancient” and “wing”, reflecting its status as a touchstone for the evolutionary measurement of newly discovered ancient bird specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9739&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9739&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fossilpic-300x286.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The “Haarlem specimen”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in recent years, Archaeopteryx has been usurped from its throne as the only known Jurassic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraves&quot;&gt;paravian theropod&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to fossil material found across the globe. Theropods, a subgroup of dinosaurs could be recognised by their three toed limbs and hollow bones. In the late Jurassic era, the paraves evolved to form a clade. Among them, the avialans, are considered closely related to modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of fossils have recently been excavated from the Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation in eastern China. Anchiornis and Xiaotingia are now considered to belong to a clade that predates archaeopteryx, making them the oldest known paravian theropods identified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx, was originally extracted from the Solnhofen Limestone, found in the German state of Bavaria. Currently Archaeopteryx remains the oldest paravian theropod reported outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 12 skeletal specimens of Archaeopteryx have been identified.  However a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Christian Foth and Oliver Rauhut, has cast doubt over the identity of one specimen currently located at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors then go further, proposing a new genus &lt;em&gt;Ostromia,&lt;/em&gt; of which the re-evaluated Haarlem specimen forms the species O. crassipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Haarlem specimen’ comes in two pieces, with two separate parts of the same slab displaying the presence of feathers and bone markings including well preserved gastralia and feet. Overall, however, the Haarlem specimen is one of the least complete archaeopteryx specimens identified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Foth and Rauhut conducted a re-evaluation of the Haarlem specimen, using osteological analysis to conclude that a closer evolutionary relationship to the Chinese Anchiornis was more probable. The authors then go further, proposing a new genus &lt;em&gt;Ostromia,&lt;/em&gt; of which the re-evaluated Haarlem specimen forms the species O. crassipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not as old as its new Chinese relatives, the proposed new identity of the specimen provides clues on the distribution of species in the late Jurassic era. The authors argue for a radiation and dispersal of maniraptorian dinosaurs (including avialae) from eastern Asia. The high dispersal potential may have resulted in the evolutionary success of these species, particularly avian theropods: the ancestors of modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Life after death: posttraumatic growth after the loss of a loved one [video]</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135877</guid>

	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can trauma lead to positive change? Posttraumatic growth is a phenomenon experienced by those who have undergone trauma. After facing a traumatic event, those who experience posttraumatic growth endure a period of psychological struggle before eventually finding a sense of personal growth. The process can be long and difficult, and isn’t experienced by everyone who survives a traumatic event. However, an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one-half to two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of people show a positive change in perception following a traumatic life event. The following excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-group-9780190649562&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Group: Seven Widowed Fathers Reimagine Life &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;tells the story of how Neill, a widowed father of three, began showing signs of posttraumatic growth after the death of his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old clinical pearl passed down by mental health professionals holds that patients can be the “last to know” that they are getting better. Clinicians often notice improvements in mood, energy, and outlook before the patient appreciates these changes. We saw a varia­tion of this phenomenon in the fathers. The men frequently pointed out to one another areas of progress and moments of growth even when they were unable to see similar changes in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months following Deanna’s death, Neill struggled to hold on to a career in the private healthcare industry that he had spent years build­ing. Traveling several nights a week for work had been manageable when Deanna was alive. However, as the sole parent of four children, Neill knew he wouldn’t be able to maintain this schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neill met with his supervisors and asked if he could reduce the num­ber of days he had to be on the road. Unfortunately, the job required a minimum amount of travel that was simply too much for him to manage and he reluctantly resigned. Neill couldn’t bring himself to conduct an extensive job search in the rapidly changing healthcare field. Instead, he reached out to a friend who needed help managing local apartment com­plexes. The job wasn’t glamorous and paid less than what Neill had been earning but it offered flexible hours, required no travel, and gave him the time he needed to care for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Neill began his new job, his focus remained on his family. When either of his younger children was too sick to go to school, he remained at home for the day. If he stayed up late helping his older children complete a science project or term paper, he went to work the next morning more exhausted than usual. Despite feeling physically and emotionally drained, Neill discovered something unexpected: He was growing closer to his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that there’s just one parent left. Me. I’m doing the best I can and I’m just glad that my kids and I are tighter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his teenage son, Jack, were communicating better than ever. Their long and difficult conversation about the circumstances leading up to Deanna’s death had been a turning point in their relationship. Neill’s two youngest children were now physically affectionate with him in ways that they had once reserved for their mother. But the changes in his relationship with Julie surprised Neill the most. As a fifteen- year- old, she had insisted on spending the first anniversary of her mother’s death with her friends rather than with her family. Now, as a college freshman, Julie called Neill nearly every day to tell him about her classes and new friends she had made. She clearly missed her father and Neill felt great about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a group meeting nearly two years after Deanna’ death, Karl asked Neill if he still felt that the wrong parent died. Neill thought for a moment before answering. “I suppose that a part of me will always feel that way. But I don’t think about it the same way now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What changed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, lots of things. I’m around my kids so much more than I was before Deanna died. And when I’m with them, I’m really &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;them. My relationship with each of my children is better. I’m not saying that we don’t still have our moments but, overall, we are much closer than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, does that mean you no longer think they ended up with the wrong parent?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Listen, you guys have heard me talk about how Deanna was such a fantastic mother. The kids were so attached to her and they always went to her first for everything. Now that I’m the go- to parent, that’s how they see me. So, I guess that I don’t see it as a comparison anymore. The reality is that there’s just one parent left. Me. I’m doing the best I can and I’m just glad that my kids and I are tighter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel the same way.” Bruce replied. “My girls and I wouldn’t be as close if Lisa were still alive. It’s ironic that we feel more connected to our kids &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;our wives died. I never would have been the one to talk with them about all the ‘female stuff.’ Now? I’m practically an expert on periods, tam­pons, training bras, you name it. At first, I thought there was no way that I could have those conversations. But I had to and it’s changed how we communicate as a family. I desperately hate being a widower but I love that I’ve grown closer with my kids as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neill asked Bruce, “Do you ever worry about how people will react when you say stuff like that? I don’t know, almost as if it sounds like you’re glad that Lisa died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I used to worry about that, for sure. Each time I would mention some­thing being better now compared to how it used to be, I felt like I needed to begin by saying, ‘Of course, I would have given anything if Lisa hadn’t died, but… .’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exactly. I’m the same way,” Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve stopped doing that, though,” Bruce added. “People get it. They understand what I’m saying. And if they don’t … well, that’s not my problem. I don’t need to apologize because some good has come from my nightmare. None of us do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange between Neill and Bruce was an explicit acknowledgment of unexpected growth after the deaths of their wives. It represented a shift in how the men would talk with each other about their experiences. Instead of merely surviving their tragedies, they were, in some ways, growing in surprising ways. The group started sharing other stories of getting “bet­ter”: improved planning and organizational skills; newfound creativity in the kitchen; deeper empathy for others who were struggling in one way or another; the courage to audition for a church play. We explained that these were all examples of posttraumatic growth and told them about the blossoming body of research on trauma- related benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid- 1990s, Richard Tedeschi and John Calhoun, research psy­chologists at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, introduced the term &lt;em&gt;posttraumatic growth&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast to the familiar, long- established problem of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which a traumatic event leads to physiological, mood, and behavioral symptoms, posttrau­matic growth is the process by which people adjust, adapt, and even thrive after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTSD and posttraumatic growth may seem like two ends of the same spectrum; however, research suggests that they are separate, if still related, responses to trauma. In fact, people who endure traumatic events often experience both distress and growth simultaneously or at different times.  Researchers have identified several ways in which a person may grow following a tragedy. Neill and Bruce demonstrated perhaps the most important change: improved interpersonal relationships. People may also feel more appreciation for things they once took for granted or find that they are open to new opportunities. They may develop a deeper under­standing of their spirituality or feel stronger and more resilient than before.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Modern neuroscience has been accused of being a 'new phrenology', but now researchers have conducted a modern evaluation of phrenological claims using neuroscience methods.

In an enjoyable new preprint called An empirical, 21st century evaluation of phrenology, Oxford researchers Oiwi Parker Jones and colleagues say that they've rigorously tested, and debunked, phrenology for the first time.



Notoriously, the phrenologists believed that the shape of an individual's skull provided clues</description>

(2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?&quot;&gt;prodromal states&lt;/a&gt; have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, &lt;strike&gt;Frazier&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fraser et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DementiaBank&lt;/a&gt; database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using factor analysis, the researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four dimensions of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;were most indicative of dementia: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semantic impairment&lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;using overly simple words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acoustic impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;e.g., speaking more  slowly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntactic impairment  &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;using less complex grammar &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berisha et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; examined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantified linguistic features included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of unique words&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-specific nouns – e.g., &lt;i&gt;thing, something, anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filler words – &lt;i&gt;well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-imageability, high frequency verbs &lt;i&gt;– e.g., &lt;i&gt;get, give, go, have, do&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Reagan showed a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feb. 16 press conference&lt;/a&gt;, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Personality Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (NPD), as speculated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; grandiose status as POTUS): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing constant admiration from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pompous and arrogant demeanor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And we can call him &lt;b&gt;narcissistic&lt;/b&gt; in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;NY Times&lt;/i&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by 35 mental health professionals?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forcefully argued&lt;/a&gt; that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discourse Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is probably my favorite part so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called nuclear weapons  and other &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, lots of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with uranium,  including some bad &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Russia.  I've &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for Russia.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;train wreck&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!&lt;/b&gt; But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are &lt;strike&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+letterman+donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below). Letterman has aged too, so you might as well analyze his speech as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors performed... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...a 10-fold cross-validation procedure in which a unique 10% of the data (i.e., the ‘test set’) are used in each iteration for evaluation, and the remaining 90% (i.e., the ‘training set’) are used to select the most useful features (of the 370 available as described in “Features” above) and construct our models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers are retracting a 2016 PNAS paper that described a way to create gasoline-like fuels directly from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Senior author Frederick MacDonnell, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), told us he originally thought his team had made a preliminary breakthrough that might “solve the world’s energy problems.” Instead, […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: GABA and glycine sometimes are interchangeable, by Jaime de Juan Sanz</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19493</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/4602242263_77fc03c1d1_o-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensory environment contains multiple streams of information that must be efficiently processed and categorized by the CNS. Sound, for example, is transformed into neural signals in the cochlea, which are then transmitted and processed in the auditory brainstem, an ensemble of nuclei belonging to the efferent and afferent auditory systems. One particular region of the auditory brainstem, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC), is known to integrate most ascending auditory information from lower brainstem regions, receiving inputs from several nuclei, including a prominent long-range inhibitory input from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). &lt;strong&gt;The ICC acts as an integrative station that is involved in the routing of multi-modal sensory perception&lt;/strong&gt;, controlling for example the startle response and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The startle response is finely modulated by inhibitory inputs from the VNLL, which are classically considered to be glycinergic (Ono and Ito, 2015), and it is known that global lack of glycinergic neurotransmission in humans causes Startle Disease or Hyperekplexia (OMIM 149400), a rare neurological disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle reflex in response to acoustic or tactile stimuli, among other symptoms. Despite the role of glycinergic release from VNLL neurons is known, &lt;strong&gt;histological evidence suggests that these neurons may corelease glycine and GABA in the ICC&lt;/strong&gt;, which could be relevant for startle disease. However, functional evidence for glycine/GABA corelease has not been shown experimentally in this pathway, in part because ascending fibers from lower brainstem regions contain multiple sources of pure GABAergic inputs and electrical stimulation in these regions would activate these inputs, making it unfeasible to measure corelease from VNLL glycinergic fibers in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in The Journal of Neuroscience, Moore and Trussell (2017) circumvented this limitation using optogenetics, which allowed them to control and selectively manipulate glycinergic neurons without co-activating surrounding ascending GABAergic axons. Glycinergic neurons uniquely express a presynaptic glycine transporter, GlyT2, which recycles glycine to refill presynaptic vesicles (de Juan-Sanz et al., 2013). Moore and Trussell used a GlyT2-Cre mouse line to express Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in glycinergic neurons in a floxed/reversed (Cre-dependent) manner, either globally or specifically within the VNLL. Using these two approaches, &lt;strong&gt;they photostimulated ascending glycinergic fibers and recorded light-evoked IPSCs from single neurons in the ICC using electrophysiology&lt;/strong&gt;. These experiments easily identified inhibitory currents, which were further dissected using pharmacology against glycine or GABA receptors to understand whether GABA is coreleased with glycine, as suggested by histological data. &lt;strong&gt;These experiments unequivocally demonstrated that GABA is coreleased with glycine in VNLL inputs&lt;/strong&gt; and revealed an average GABAergic component of ~40% of the light-evoked ICC currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why GABA/glycine corelease? Do they have different functions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics allowed the authors to explore the characteristics of glycinergic and GABAergic components separately to probe for possible functional differences in the signaling of these coreleased neurotransmitters. These experiments are particularly interesting for the field, as there is currently limited understanding of the physiological roles of corelease in the same synapse, especially in the auditory midbrain. In the CNS GABA is coreleased with a variety of other neurotransmitters (Tritsch et al., 2016), but &lt;strong&gt;GABA/glycine corelease is one of the most paradoxical examples as both are fast inhibitory neurotransmitters&lt;/strong&gt;. Many functions of GABA/glycine corelease have been proposed, including subserving tonic versus phasic inhibition via different time courses of glycinergic and GABAergic synaptic currents, extra-fast inhibition, and compensation by one neurotransmitter during periods of sustained activity. To better understand the unique functions of each neurotransmitter in the VNLL-ICC synapse, the authors explored the responses in the ICC to glycine or GABA released from VNLL neurons, specifically measuring differences in kinetics, contacts with cell types in the ICC, short-term depression dynamics and effects of GABA on presynaptic glycine release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetics of glycine and GABA are typically different, as it is known that GABAergic currents normally decay more slowly than glycinergic currents (Russier et al., 2002). Thus, glycine and GABA could serve different functions through differing postsynaptic kinetics. Surprisingly, the authors found that in the ICC, GABAergic currents were nearly as fast as glycinergic currents (3.7 vs 3.0 ms respectively), indicating that in this synapse slow depolarizing GABAergic IPSCs do not occur as observed in other situations. Cellular subtypes in the ICC express mainly the α1-GABA receptor subunit that endows GABA receptors with fast kinetics, which likely accounts for the observed phenotype. The authors then explored whether GABA and glycine present unique roles in short-term synaptic depression, as this high frequency stimulation could result in the selective depletion of one transmitter over the other. Similarly, no difference was found, as the relative contribution of glycine and GABA to the postsynaptic current was not dependent on the length and frequency of stimulation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that &lt;strong&gt;coreleased glycinergic and GABAergic currents in the ICC had strikingly similar features&lt;/strong&gt;, not supporting popular hypotheses for the different functions of GABA and glycine during corelease and suggesting that the two neurotransmitters may function interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the relevance of these discoveries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are particularly relevant to our molecular understanding of startle disease and how the medical community is treating this dysfunction. It is known that the startle response is finely tuned by inhibitory inputs from the VNLL, classically considered glycinergic. However, results from Moore and Trussell clearly demonstrate that a GABAergic component contributes to VNLL inhibition in the ICC, and their detailed studies of glycine and GABA responses in this pathway suggest that the two neurotransmitters may be functionally interchangeable. This suggests &lt;strong&gt;symptoms of the exaggerated startle response in hyperekplexia might be reduced by compensating for the lack of glycinergic neurotransmission with increased GABAergic neurotransmission&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, currently the most effective treatment for startle disease is the administration of GABA receptor agonists, such as Clonazepam, which significantly reduces startle activity in hyperekplexia patients (Zhou et al., 2002). Moore and Trussell’s results offer new details that should help to understand the molecular basis of this pharmacological compensation, helping the medical community to better exploit this pathway for future benefit. In addition, this work reveals a &lt;strong&gt;new role for glycine/GABA corelease in the CNS, where the action of both neurotransmitters appears interchangeable&lt;/strong&gt;. Independent receptor modulation coupled with the highly similar features of coreleased GABA and glycine observed in the study by Moore and Trussell may further permit the neurotransmitters to compensate for one another under conditions where one system is compromised, maintaining homeostasis of inhibitory networks integrated in the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: How CCTV software can help diagnose intellectual disability</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/01/05/how-cctv-software-can-help-diagnose-intellectual-disability/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/iStock-692805684-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychological and economic burden of intellectual disability (ID) on families is huge, with 1.5-2% of all children having an IQ &amp;lt; 70 and 0.3-0.5% of children having moderate-severe ID with an IQ &amp;lt;50. A craniofacial anomaly is described in 30-50% of the known genetic causes of ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced genomic sequencing can now identify variations in the DNA code of all ≈1500 known developmental disorder genes in one test. In 30-50% of cases, a diagnosis will be made by showing that a DNA variant has affected the function of a known gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are a large number of genes of unknown function. When variants are detected in these genes or in non-coding DNA, it can be difficult to determine if they are normal variations or the cause of the syndrome. Therefore, the question remains how best to proceed when a child with syndromic intellectual disability remains undiagnosed despite testing all the known developmental disorder genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the DNA variants of individuals with similar features can lead to the discovery of new ID genes. However, locating at minimum a second individual or a cluster of individuals with similar facial features currently relies on doctors comparing photographs of undiagnosed children at medical meetings or recording written descriptions into international phenotyping and genetic variant databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One novel approach to this issue is the use of computer face-matching technology. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-017-0410-1&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dudding et al. report an automated approach to matching the faces of non-identical individuals with one of ten genetic syndrome subgroups within a database of 3,145 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer face-matching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core computer face-matching technology (FMT) used in this study was initially developed to match facial images of individuals for the primary purpose of recognizing blurry faces in CCTV for policing and counterterrorism. The software is being used to detect persons of interest in large crowd gatherings through various police and other security agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the software was developed for CCTV, high quality professional photographs are not required and even poor quality historical photographs can readily be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the software was developed for CCTV, high quality professional photographs are not required and even poor quality historical photographs can readily be used. This technology is unique as it uses low-resolution structural and frequency domain features rather than high resolution features. It is based on spatial textures and statistical models and is simultaneously insensitive to pose, illumination, expression, obscuration, blurring, decoding artifacts, and low-resolution images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the leave- one-out method (removing an individual image from the database and letting the software list the top 10 closest matches when the removed image is used as the test case), the computer face matching technology correctly identifies a top match, at least one correct match in the top five and at least one in the top 10 more than expected by chance. The accuracy of the software scored favorably compared with three senior clinical geneticists. There was low agreement between the technology and clinicians, with higher accuracy of the technology when results were discordant for all syndromes except Kabuki syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the accuracy of the computer face-matching technology was tested on images of individuals with known syndromic forms of intellectual disability, the results of this study illustrate the potential utility of face-matching technology within deep phenotyping platforms to facilitate the interpretation of DNA sequencing data for individuals who remain undiagnosed despite testing the known developmental disorder genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological therapy is only available for the minority of individuals with intellectual disability due to rare metabolic diseases; however, a definitive molecular diagnosis can inform prognosis, guide management, reduce the need for extensive investigations and restore reproductive confidence for parents planning further children. Understanding the genetic basis of ID is the first step towards understanding interacting biological pathways and possible targeted genetic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see stress as helpful or harmful? If you recognise that it can have upsides – by sharpening your focus and boosting your motivation, and that stressful challenges can offer learning and achievement opportunities – then you have a positive stress mindset (conversely, if you see stress as unpleasant, debilitating and threatening, then you have a negative stress mindset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2017.1374947&quot;&gt;A new diary study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has explored the implications of stress mindset for the workplace – surprisingly, one of the first investigations to do so. The researchers, led by Anne Casper at the University of Mannheim, found that anticipating a large workload on a given day was associated with employees upping their performance that day, taking more proactive steps to meet the challenge, and ending the day feeling more energised, but only if they had a positive stress mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32987&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come from 171 employees in various occupations and industries, mainly education, health and social care, and IT. Their average age was 39 and just over half were men. They first completed a survey about their stress mindset. Then they completed an online diary three times a day – morning, after work, before bed – for five working days. In the morning, the diary prompted them to answer questions about the their expected workload that day. Later, it asked them about any constructive steps they’d taken to meet the day’s challenges, such as planning and scheduling, and seeing the challenge as a learning opportunity. In the evening, participants also indicated how well they’d performed, and how energetic they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For employees with a positive stress mindset, there was an association between expecting a larger workload and taking more proactive steps to cope. In turn, these proactive, constructive behaviours (the researchers call this “approach coping”) were related to performing better, and feeling more energised. But for those with a negative stress mindset, this association was reversed – the more workload they anticipated, the less they performed constructive coping behaviours. In turn, the worse these workers said they’d performed, and the less energised they felt at the day’s end. This is consistent with the idea that people with a negative stress mindset try to cope through avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings complement previous research that’s shown our stress mindset can influence how we respond to challenges. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437923&quot;&gt;students with a positive stress mindset are more inclined to seek out feedback&lt;/a&gt; after completing a stressful task (presumably because they see it as a chance to learn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casper and her colleagues said their new results show the benefits that could come from raising people’s awareness of the concept of stress mindset. Promisingly, they said there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437923&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that people can be helped to develop a positive stress mindset. However, they also acknowledged some limitations with their research – for instance, they didn’t look at employees’ expectations about how difficult their work will be (only how much they had to do). Similarly, the measure of stress mindset lacked nuance. Some people may think modest amounts of stress are helpful, for example, but that extreme stress is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d add another caveat – this study doesn’t provide strong causal evidence for the effects of stress mindset. That would require altering some employees’ stress mindset through a training programme and looking to see what effects this had on their behaviour and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s worth noting, as the researchers do, that this study focused on effects within a single day. It’s well-established that a &lt;em&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; excessive workload is associated with negative outcomes for health and performance (most likely regardless of mindset). This study shows that having a positive stress mindset may help us cope with – perhaps even benefit from – a particularly challenging, high intensity work day, but this shouldn’t be taken as a justification for bosses to overburden their staff long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Ten steps to take when starting out in practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135884</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/514920448/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting out in practice is challenging; especially if your training did not include much of an emphasis on practice development. Most training programs don’t as they have very tight curriculums and focus on teaching the core knowledge and skills needed to prepare one to be a competent and effective clinician. Leaving out the core business of practice skills needed to create a sustainable practice environment can make the transition into private practice quite challenging and anxiety provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share ten basic steps to take if you are thinking about getting into practice or have just begun. It doesn’t replace reading all you can and getting professional consultation, but it can help get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your vision: &lt;/strong&gt;Before doing a lot of planning and making major business decisions, create the vision for your practice. Why are you in practice? Go further than simply saying “to help people” or “to earn a living”. Those are outcomes that you are hoping to achieve. What is the deeper purpose? Being clear about this can help you align the many decisions ahead with your core vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carefully choose your practice, clinical mentors, and consultants: &lt;/strong&gt;Private practice is not a do-it-yourself venture. Even if you are going into solo practice, it is important to get input and support to avoid the many pitfalls that you may not even know exist. You can stumble through it, or you can respect the great investment you have made in time, energy, and money, and other sacrifices you have made, to be sure you have your advisors and their expertise and support in place to in order for you to make the most of your career. While many clinicians think of working with an accountant and an attorney, we often recommend seeking out mentors who can help you with clinical issues while also having a practice management consultant to help with set up, marketing, and operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build your clinical expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; Many mental health professionals are generalists. They don’t have unique skills compared to their colleagues, and are not seen as offering unique services in the community (or marketplace). Keeping in mind your vision, develop a niche as part of your practice and offer something that is new and of benefit to members of your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Keeping in mind your vision, develop a niche as part of your practice and offer something that is new and of benefit to members of your community.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine the structure of your practice: &lt;/strong&gt;Are you going to go into solo practice? Are you going to have a partner or form a group practice? If so, be sure to specifically address such things as how decisions will be made (especially if you disagree), what your responsibilities will be, how each of you will be compensated, and even how you will terminate your relationship down the road if one of you desires to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a well thought out business plan: &lt;/strong&gt;Decide on the specific strategies you’ll take to build a successful practice. How will you be different from the competition? What will your “brand” be? How will you market the practice and to whom? Also focus on how your practice will operate financially during the startup phase and beyond. How much greater will projected revenues be compared to your expenses based on how you are structuring your practice? Will that net provide enough compensation for you to make ends meet in your personal life? Do the math to make sure the decisions you are making also are sensible financially. Meeting your personal financial needs is crucial to building a sustainable practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get it in writing:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you are signing a lease, setting up a partnership agreement, or renting equipment, be sure to have your agreements in writing. Be sure that you and your attorney read, fully understand, and agree to &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the fine print in advance of signing the document. Contracts that are presented to you are generally not written to protect your interests. What you allege is said by a corporate representative (e.g., in provider relations at a managed care company) is not what will prevail if there is a written agreement that says something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carefully plan your office administration policies and procedures: &lt;/strong&gt;Be attentive to such things as how you will process new cases, how you will assure regulatory compliance, how you will track key business metrics, how will you make the administrative tasks run efficiently and in a cost-effective manner, and how you will protect against fraud and loss. Having written policies and procedures in place will be helpful both to prevent problems and to ensure you and others who work in your practice respond appropriately when difficulties arise over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_135903&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-135903&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rawpixel-com-351765.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;Let’s shake on this by rawpixel.com.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your time:&lt;/strong&gt; Practices grow like plants. They have different stages of development. Too often practice owners want to go too fast and make bold decisions in advance of being ready and in advance of having thought out the prerequisites for such a decision (as well as the pros and cons). The adage “first things first” certainly applies. For example, taking on associates before you have established a strong referral base can lead to major problems. Having unhappy associates because they don’t have enough work and aren’t making enough income can lead to turnover and a community image that you have an unstable practice. Similarly, not handling the flow of referrals because you don’t have an associate can lead to a sense that your practice is never available. Take the time and care needed to build a strong base to your practice before making decisions that you are not fully prepared to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for things to change: &lt;/strong&gt;As excited as you may be to start your practice, or to take it to the next level, always consider how you will shift from what you are planning to your next stage of development. Make sure you have an “exit strategy” to help you with the transitions that are down the road and out of sight. For example, how might you leave the practice if your life partner gets a different job in another state, or the practice partnership does not work out? Thinking this through at the start can help you structure your practice in a way that allows room for things to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build your relationships: &lt;/strong&gt;While most mental health clinical activities are done in private, your practice is both its own system and also part of the other systems in the community. What is your relationship with your community? Are you visible in your community, actively engaged in it, and do you regularly contribute to its welfare? Be attuned to how you are coming across to others and interacting with your colleagues. In essence you are always marketing, as virtually everyone you come in contact with can be a potential referral source when they are asked by a loved one or friend, “Do you know someone who is a good mental health professional?” Your relationships will be impacted by how you function in them, and so will your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games do not enjoy the best of reputations. Violent games in particular have been linked with aggression, antisocial behaviour and alienation among teens. For example, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19207695&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that playing a mere 10 minutes of a violent video game was enough to reduce helping behaviour in participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some experts are sceptical about whether games really cause aggression and, even if the games are to blame, it remains unclear what drives their harmful effects. Earlier studies identified empathy as a key trait that may be affected by violent gameplay. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/12/1869/4344826&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Laura Stockdale at Loyola University Chicago and her colleagues in &lt;i&gt;Social Affective and Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; has taken a closer look at how gamers and non-gamers differ at a neural level, uncovering evidence that suggests chronic violent gameplay may affect emotional brain processing, although more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32980&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were classified as frequent or infrequent players of video games depending on weekly usage – at least 30 hours of screen time per week was considered frequent, while no more than five hours a week was considered infrequent. Next, the scientists looked at the top three games their participants played, more specifically if the majority were either violent (for example, a shooter video game such as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;) or non-violent (for example &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;). This yielded a sample of 30 frequent players of violent video games (gamers) and 31 infrequent players of non-violent games (controls). Both groups had an average age of 21 and all were male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed an established empathy questionnaire, with the gamers scoring lower than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the actual experiment, the researchers recorded participants’ brain waves using electroencephalography (EEG) while they completed a modified version of the “stop-signal task” (SST). The SST contained male and female faces with fearful or happy expressions and there were two types of trial: On Go trials, participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether the face was male or female by pressing a button. On No-go (stop) trials – indicated by a box around the face – participants had to withhold making any response. This version of the SST is generally considered an implicit measure of emotion processing because participants have to pay attention to the gender of the faces while trying to ignore the emotions on the faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamers and controls performed similarly on this task. Crucially, however, the brain activity of the two groups differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were particularly interested in three components of the EEG recordings during the stop-signal task, the so-called P100, N170 and N200/P300 (these positive or negative spikes of neural activity, known as “event-related potentials”, occur at different times after the stimuli). The P100 (a positive spike 100ms after the stimulus) is one of the earliest indices of processing of visual information and has been associated with attention to emotional information. The N170 is evoked by viewing a human face, especially if it displays a negative emotion (such as fear). Finally, the N200/P300 is generally believed to be associated with inhibiting responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Go trials, gamers showed a reduced P100 in response specifically to happy faces, as compared to the controls. This suggests the gamers may have been paying less attention to positive facial stimuli. Interestingly, however, this was explained by differences in empathy rather than screen time or game content. When examining only the gamers who scored high on the empathy questionnaire, they did not differ neurally from the controls. This indicates that empathy manifests in the earliest stages of how we process emotional information, and this could be one way that violent video games affect our perception. In line with this, the gamers showed an earlier N170 to happy than to fearful faces, which is the opposite of what normally happens (and the opposite of the pattern shown by the controls). This may indicate that gamers gave reduced neural priority to threatening faces, compared with normal, perhaps due to their overexposure to threatening content in games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, gamers seemed to require a lower amount of neural resources to inhibit their responses (as shown by a reduced N200/P300). It could be that video games train cognitive function and this is why gamers need fewer mental resources for this task. Alternatively, and in line with the finding of a reduced P100 amplitude, it could be that gamers simply pay less attention to emotional information, are less distracted by it and thus needed fewer mental resources for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers said their results are consistent with the idea that the chronic playing of violent video games affects people’s empathy and the way their brains process emotional facial expressions and control their behavioural responses. In short, chronic violent gameplay may leave players “callous, cool and in control”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interesting, this study is not free of limitations. Clearly, the biggest drawback lies with the cross-sectional design, which cannot clarify whether violent video gameplay causes lower empathy and reduced emotional processing or the other way around. Also, it is not easy to disentangle the effects of video gaming content (i.e., whether it is violent or not) and gaming duration because there was no group of frequent players of non-violent video games or infrequent players of violent video games. Plausibly, the duration gamers spend each week on their consoles could be more important than what the video game is about. For obvious reasons, any association between video gaming and empathy found here only applies to a Western context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So more research is clearly needed. But if chronic exposure to violent video games really is associated with lower empathy and emotional callousness, this could have major implications for policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/12/1869/4344826&quot;&gt;Cool, callous and in control: superior inhibitory control in frequent players of video games with violent content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Nerd Food: The Refactoring Quagmire&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_07.org&quot;&gt;The latest Dogen sprint&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be a really long and tortuous one, which is all the more perplexing given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_06.org&quot;&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_05.org&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_04.org&quot;&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_03.org&quot;&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it. Clearly, the slope of the curve is steepening unrelentingly. Experience teaches that whenever you find yourself wandering over such terrains, it is time to stop and gather your thoughts; more likely than not, you are going the wrong way - fast. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, for Dogen, this a post of reflection. To the casual reader - if nothing else - it will hopefully serve as a cautionary tale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Not Even Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the lucky few internauts who avidly follows our release notes, you may recall that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.06&quot;&gt;previous sprint&lt;/a&gt; had produced a moment of enlightenment where we finally understood &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;core of Dogen. At the time, it felt like one of those rare &lt;i&gt;eureka&lt;/i&gt;moments, and &quot;the one last great change to the architecture&quot;; afterwards, all would be light. &quot;Famous last words&quot;, you may have said then and, of course, if you did, you were right. But given the historical context, the optimism wasn't entirely unjustified. To understand why, we need to quickly recap how the architecture has evolved over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogen started out divided into three very distinct parts: the frontends (Dia, JSON), the middle-end (&lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;) and the backends (C++, C#). The &quot;pipeline&quot; metaphor guided our design because we saw Dogen very much like a compiler, with its frontend, middle-end and backend stages. This was very handy as it meant we could test all stages of the pipeline in isolation. Composition was done by orchestrating frontend, middle-end and backends, at a higher level. This architecture had very good properties when it came to testability and debuggability: we'd start by running the entire pipeline and locating the problem; then, one could easily isolate the issue to a specific component either by looking at the log file, or by dumping the inputs and outputs of the different stages and sifting through them. As a result, bug reproduction was very straightforward since we just needed to record the inputs and create the test at the right level. Whilst the names of the models and their responsibilities changed over time, the overall pipeline architecture remained so since the very early days of Dogen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In parallel to this, a second trend had emerged over the last ten sprints or so: we moved more and more functionality from the frontends and backends to the middle-end. The key objective here was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%2527t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;: we soon found a lot of commonalities between frontends, driving us to create a simple frontend intermediate format so that the work was carried out only once. Not long after, we discovered that backends suffered from precisely the same malaise, so the same cure begun to be applied there too. So far so good, as we were following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~sgiroux/COURS/2008/ift785/fichiers/articles/Roberts_EvolvingFrameworks.pdf&quot;&gt;Roberts and Johnson's&lt;/a&gt; sage advice: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People develop abstractions by generalizing from concrete examples. Every attempt to determine the correct abstractions on paper without actually developing a running system is doomed to failure. No one is that smart. A framework is a reusable design, so you develop it by looking at the things it is supposed to be a design of. The more examples you look at, the more general your framework will be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The literature was with us and the wind was on our sails: the concrete code in the frontends and backends was slowly cleaned up, made general and moved across to the middle-end. As this process took hold, the middle-end grew and grew in size and responsibilities, just as everybody else shed them. Before long, we ended up with one big model, a couple medium-sized models and lots of very small models: &quot;modelets&quot;, we named them. These were models with very little responsibility other than gluing together one or two things. The overhead of maintaining a physical component (e.g. static or dynamic library) for the sake of one or two classes seemed a tad too high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we begun to extrapolate the trend somewhat, a vision suddenly appeared: why not centralise &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; in the middle-end? That is: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;place &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; meta-models and transforms in one single central location, together with their orchestration; call it the &quot;core model&quot;; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;orchestration becomes either helper code or a transform in its own right; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;within this &quot;core model&quot;, provide interfaces that backends and frontends implement, injecting them dynamically; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make these new interfaces appear as transform chains themselves (mostly). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this elegant and clean brave new world, we would no longer have &quot;ends&quot; as such but something more akin to &quot;plugins&quot;, dynamically glued into the &quot;middle-end&quot; via the magic of dependency injection; the &quot;middle-end&quot; itself would no longer be a &quot;middle&quot; but &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; center of everything. Backends and frontends had to merely implement the interfaces supplied by the core and the system would just magically sort itself out. The idea seemed amazing and we quickly moved to implementation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alas, in our haste to jump into the fray, we had forgotten to heed Mencken: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]here is always a well-known solution to every human problem — neat, plausible, and wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;The Strange Loop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest downsides of working alone and in your spare time is the lack of feedback from other developers. And it's not even just that other developers will teach you lots of new things. No, most often than not, they'll simply drag you away from the echo chambers and tunnels of self-reinforcement you carefully craft and curate for yourself. You are your own intellectual jailer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the cold light of day, any developer will tell you that creating cycles is not a good idea, and should not be done without a great deal of thought. Yet, we managed to create &quot;circular&quot; dependencies between all components of the system by centralising all responsibilities into &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;. Now, you may say that these are not &quot;canonically circular&quot; - and this is probably why the problem was not picked up in the first place - because &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; provides interfaces for other models to implement. Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Large-Scale-C-Software-Design-APC/dp/0201633620&quot;&gt;Lakos&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful here in explaining what is going on: our &lt;i&gt;logical design&lt;/i&gt; had no cycles - because &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; does not explicitly call any frontends or backends - but the &lt;i&gt;physical design&lt;/i&gt;did have them. And these came at a cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, it screwed up &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-whiteboard.github.io/coding/debugging/2016/04/07/reasonable-code.html&quot;&gt;reasonability&lt;/a&gt;. Even though frontends and backends still had their own models, the net result was that we jumbled up all of the elements of the pipeline into a single model, making it really hard to tell what's what. Explaining the system to a new developer now required saying things such as &quot;ah, don't worry about that part for now, it belongs to the middle-end, but here we are dealing only with the backends&quot; - a clear code smell. Once a property of the architecture, reasonability now had to be conveyed in lossy natural language. Testability and debuggability got screwed up too because now everything went through one single central model; if you needed to test a frontend fix you still required building the backends and middle-end and initialise them too. Our pursuit of clarity muddied up the waters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, an even more pertinent question arose: just when exactly should you stop refactoring? In my two decades of professional development, I had never encountered this problem. In the real world, you are fortunate if you get a tiny amount of time allocated to refactoring - most of the time you need to somehow sneak it in into some overall estimate and hope no one notices. Like sharks, Project Managers (PM) are bred to smell refactoring efforts from a mile a way and know how to trim estimates down to the bone. Even when you are in a greenfield project or just lucky enough to have an enlightened PM who will bat for you, you still need to contend with the realities of corporate development: you need to ship, &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;. No one gets away with endless refactoring. No one, that is, other than the Free and Open Source Software Developer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many a spare time project, Dogen is my test bed of ideas around coding and coding processes; a general sandbox to have fun outside of work. As such - and very much by design - the traditional feedback loops that exist in the real world need not apply. I wanted to see what would happen if you coded without &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; constraints and, in the end, what I found out was that if you do not self-impose some kind of halting machinery, &lt;i&gt;you will refactor on forever&lt;/i&gt;. In practice, physics still apply, so your project will eventually die out because its energy will dissipate across the many refactoring fronts and entropy will, as always, triumph. But if you really want to keep it at bay, at least for a little while, you need to preserve energy by having one single, consistent vision - &quot;wrong&quot; as it may be according to some metric or other. For, as Voltaire said and we often forget, &quot;le mieux est l'ennemi du bien&quot;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trouble is that refactoring is made up of a set of engineering trade-offs, and when you optimise for one thing you'll inevitably make something else worse. So, first and foremost, you need to make sure you understand what your trade-offs are, and prioritise accordingly. Secondly, looking for a global minima in such a gigantic multidimensional space is impossible, so you need to make do with local minima. But how do you known you reach a &quot;good enough&quot; point in that space? You need some kind of conceptual cost function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Descending the Gradient&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was that we started by defining the key dimensions across which we were trying to optimise. This can be phrased slightly differently: given what we now know about the domain and its implementation, what are the most important characteristics of an idealised physical and logical design? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some thinking, the final answer was deceptively simple: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;the entities of the logical design (models, namespaces, classes, methods and the like) should reflect what one reads in the literature of Model Driven Engineering (MDE). That is, a person competent on the field should find a code base that talks his or her language. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;logical and physical design should promote reasonability and isolation, and thus orchestration should be performed via composition rather than by circular physical dependencies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, these are the two fundamental pillars guiding the Dogen architecture; any engineering trade-offs to be made must ensure these dimensions take precedence. In other words, we can only optimise away any &quot;modelets&quot; if they do not impact negatively either of these two dimensions. If they do, then we must discard this refactoring option. More generally, it is now possible to &quot;cost&quot; all refactoring activity - a conceptual refactoring gradient descent if you'd like; it either brings us closer to the local minima or further away. It gave us a sieve with which to filter the product and sprint backlogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To cut a rather long story short, we ended up with a &quot;final&quot; - ha, ha - set of changes to the architecture to get us closer to the local minima: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;move away from sewing terms&lt;/b&gt;: from the beginning we had used terms such as &lt;code&gt;knitter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; and so forth. These were… colourful, but did not add any value and detracted us from the first dimension. This was a painful decision but clearly required if one is to comply to point one above: we need to replace all sewing terms with domain specific vocabulary. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;reorganise the models into a pipeline&lt;/b&gt;: however, instead of simply going back to the &quot;modelets&quot; of the past, we need to have a deep think as to what responsibilities belong at what stage of the pipeline. Perhaps the &quot;modelets&quot; were warning us of design failures. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its never a great feeling when you end a long and arduous sprint only to figure out you were going in the wrong direction in design space. In fact, it is rather frustrating. We have many stories in the product backlog which are really exciting and which will add real value to the end users - well, at this point, just us really but hey - yet we seemed to be lost in some kind of refactoring ground hog day, with no end in sight. However, the main point of Dogen is to teach, and learn we undoubtedly did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with anything in the physical world, nothing in software engineering exists in splendid perfection like some kind of platonic solid. Perfection belongs to the realm of maths. In engineering, something can only be described as &quot;fit for purpose&quot;, and to do so requires to first determine best we can what that purpose might be. So, before you wonder into a refactoring quagmire of your own making, be sure to have a very firm idea of what your trade-offs are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2018-01-03 Wed 15:55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.2.2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s a stereotype that mental distress is an almost inevitable part of being highly creative. But is there any substance to this idea, or have we been misled – by biographers drawn to artists with colourful and chaotic lives, and the conceits of cultural movements like the romantics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific attempts to resolve this question, which have mainly focused on disorders of mood, have so far struggled to reach a definitive answer. However, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617699653&quot;&gt;a new review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, Christa Taylor of Albany State University has applied surgical precision to open up the existing body of research and lay out what we currently know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32973&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor identified 36 studies on the creativity-mood disorder relationship from a set of almost 3000 that were potentially relevant. She combined data from these different studies into into separate “meta-analyses”, depending on the specific question she was trying to address. We can be confident in the findings from these meta-analyses because they involved data from thousands or even millions of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor first looked at whether creative people are more likely to have a mood disorder compared to non-creative controls. She looked at data from from ten studies involving fine arts students, creative writers, and eminent figures from creative fields, and found that yes, there was a clear relationship between being creative and having a diagnosis of a mood disorder, such as depression (overall the association had a moderate-to-large effect size). This finding held across different ways of measuring creativity, such as musical performance or tests of divergent thinking (finding new ideas or solutions). Creativity was most commonly associated with bipolar disorder (a condition marked by periods of low and high mood). It was not associated with all mood disorders – for instance, dysthymic disorder (mood depression that is longer-lasting but milder in nature than clinical depression) was no more common among creative people than controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address a slightly different question –  compared to healthy controls, are people with a clinical diagnosis of mood disorder more creative? – Taylor used a second meta-analysis combining 13 studies, including a set of mega-studies involving millions of people. The answer was a quavering &lt;i&gt;no, not really&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, differences in creativity between people with mood disorder and control were statistically non-significant. Taylor only detected any meaningful differences by narrowing the definition of creativity – people with mood disorders scored higher for painting ability, for instance, but not for many other measures, such as on laboratory tests of creativity, for example. Focusing on specific disorders, Taylor found some evidence for superior creativity among those with bipolar disorder and major depression (but still the differences from controls were modest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings appear contradictory, but to simplify, they suggest that creative people are indeed liable to mood disorder, but overall there is little evidence that a mood disorder makes you more creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons why this might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps mood disorder is a boon to creativity, but this benefit is typically buried under a host of disadvantages and so doesn’t show up in most studies. (Compare with the clutch of successful people who attribute their success to struggles in early life; their existence doesn’t mean that we should expect disadvantage to reliably yield success.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If low mood does have a (often hidden) beneficial effect on creativity, one possibility is that it can initiate reflections that lead to new ways of seeing the world. This could explain why the deep dives of depression were associated with higher creativity but the chronic, less extensive dip of dysthemia was not. Moreover, by combining lows with motivation-charged highs, perhaps bipolar disorder combines the deep dives with a return to the surface, giving a chance for these insights to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative explanation for the new findings is that mood disorder doesn’t help creativity at all, but creativity creates mood disorder as a by-product. The lifestyle required in many creative fields can be punishing – I’m thinking of the musicians and stand-ups who spend most nights in Holiday Inns or on unfamiliar sofas; the financial instability and tournament-like nature of many artistic fields; the profligate substance misuse. The first meta-analysis showed that as mood disorder symptoms topped out, creativity actually dropped off, which could fit with this picture (but could also fit the boon-plus-disadvantage model, if the boon was only activated by mild symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally,  it could be that being creative just makes you appear clinically abnormal. Taylor points out this could happen in an affected manner, to “play creative”, but could also be because many aspects of the “flow state” – extended bursts of activity, disregarding the need for sleep or food, absorption or attentional wandering, rapidly flowing thoughts – are also treated as markers of bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research doesn’t fully resolve the long-running questions about whether and how mood disorders and creativity are linked, but it does pour water on some perspectives, such as expecting those struggling with a disorder to thrive creatively. Where the results are most unambiguous is in the higher incidence of disorder in creative people, which yields clear questions for future research, such as whether this is related to how strongly a culture makes assumptions about the temperament of “real artists”. And for you and me, it’s an important reminder that headlines like “creative people tend to get blue” does not imply that “being blue, you tend to get creative”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617699653&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creativity and Mood Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>In a new paper in the Journal of Experimental &amp;amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, Chris Drummond takes aim at the 'reproducibility movement' which has lately risen to prominence in science.



As one of the early advocates for this movement, I was interested to see what Drummond had to say. While I don't find his argument wholly convincing, he does raise some good points.

Drummond begins by summarizing the case for reproducible research as it sees it. The claim is that reproducibil</description>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: “Yes I can!”: the psychology behind lasting personal growth</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135736</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/514451680/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2015-12-29/why-80-percent-of-new-years-resolutions-fail&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Approximately 80%&lt;/a&gt; of New Year’s resolutions are abandoned by the second week of February. But what makes these goals so difficult to achieve? One theory is that our resolutions are often too big to manage. Sticking to major changes like dieting and exercise can become overwhelming—causing us to give up after any initial set-backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Performance accomplishments” can help mitigate these challenges: by breaking down resolutions into smaller goals, we can build the self-confidence needed to take on bigger and bigger challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/boost-9780190661731?q=boost!&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;cc=us&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sports psychologist Michael Bar-Eli discusses the psychology behind personal growth, and how he uses performance accomplishments in his own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we change our efficacy expectations from “no, I cannot” to “yes, I can”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important source is called “vicarious experiences.” Here, people obtain efficacy information by observing or imagining others engaging in a task that the observers themselves do not perform. Vicarious sources of efficacy information (that is, witnessing others successfully completing a task) are weaker than performance accomplishments of the observers themselves, but they are still of substantial importance in enhancing one’s self- efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example for this source comes from Major General Avihu Ben- Nun (born 1939), who was the eleventh commander of the Israeli Air Force from 1987 to 1992. In 1995 he too was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike other celebrities with Parkinson’s who often try to hide their disease, Ben- Nun announced it publicly, thereby serving as an inspiration for many others fighting the decease. I often use Ben- Nun’s struggle against Parkinson’s as a model; I tell myself that if he can handle it, evidently for so many years, I can, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest source, and the most dependable foundation of self-efficacy judgments, however, is “performance accomplishments,” also known as “enactive mastery experiences.” Performance accomplishments refer to clear successes and failures, which provide the most influential source of efficacy information and the most authentic evidence on which we can build robust beliefs about personal efficacy. If such experiences are generally successful, they will raise the level of self- efficacy; repeated failure will result in lower- efficacy expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout your working life, you will be faced with increasingly difficult challenges. The concept of backward generalizations, however, can help you handle these obstacles as you think about them in an incremental way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Parkinson’s disturbs my daily activities and functions for a number of hours every day. I set a goal, however, to increase the number of Parkinson’s- free hours per day (or at least keep this number stable) by regulating my body and mind through medication, rest, physical activ­ity, and joyful intellectual activities, such as writing this book. Success in achieving this goal increases my confidence, not only in my ability to gain more Parkinson’s- free hours, but also in my ability to successfully reduce the Parkinson’s influence on my life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance accomplishments source demonstrates not only that reality (i.e., one’s performance) can foster one’s expectations, but also that expectations (i.e., self- efficacy) can foster reality. This situation results in a “performance- efficacy cycle” that may account for our ability to cope with increasingly difficult problems: you wipe out a small problem, successfully coping with it; then you wipe out a somewhat bigger one, and so on. Over time people undergoing such a process increase their confidence in their ability to cope with difficult situations or obstacles, precisely because they continuously prove themselves successful in managing smaller problems. But what if something really big— and negative— suddenly falls on you? What do you do? Where do you draw the confidence in your ability to cope with it? For example, how could I cope with Parkinson’s, a &lt;em&gt;huge &lt;/em&gt;prob­lem indeed, without handling smaller problems previously? The answer lies within what I call “backward generalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the biblical story of Exodus, Pharaoh (seemingly Ramses II) is described as a demonic opponent of the Jewish people. In 1990, the late Meir Ariel— an Israeli Bob Dylan— released a song in which he lists a series of troubles he undergoes, which increase in their order of difficulty. At the end of each stanza, he repeats: “We survived Pharaoh, we will get through this too!” Over the years, that line became a widespread expres­sion in Israel to describe such “backward generalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, when coping with Parkinson’s or any other major issues in my life, I generalize backward, considering all of the other serious obstacles I have already overcome in the past. Who or what fills that role which enables me to say to myself: “Miki, you survived Pharaoh, you’ll survive this, too”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout your working life, you will be faced with increasingly dif­ficult challenges. The concept of backward generalizations, however, can help you handle these obstacles as you think about them in an incremental way. For example, when you find yourself rushing around the office like a madman trying to meet a last- minute deadline, it might be helpful to take a step back. Think about other deadlines you’ve met in the past, those that may have also seemed impossible at the time. Or consider larger issues you’ve faced and overcome— maybe you’ve had the unfortunate experi­ence of being laid off and forced into a new position or even new career. These types of major issues that you’ve successfully tackled will make a deadline seem like child’s play in comparison, a simple task that you know you can complete. If you’ve survived one hurdle, you can survive the next. Keeping the Pharaoh’s principle in mind will keep you on task and confi­dent in your performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Then the total pageviews for each post was prorated by the vintage of the post, to give an estimate of daily views.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt;The posts are listed in inverse order, starting with #5 and ending with #1 (least popular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;5 Most Unpopular Posts of 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/06/terrorism-and-implicit-association-test.html&quot;&gt;Terrorism and the Implicit Association Test&lt;/a&gt; – I actually worked pretty hard on this one. It's about the stereotyping of Muslims, the importance of language (e.g., Theresa May: “&lt;i&gt;the single, evil ideology of Islamist extremism that  preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism&lt;/i&gt;”), a demonstration that &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1&quot;&gt;Arab-Muslim IAT&lt;/a&gt; (which found little to no bias against Muslims), and some general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-We-Really-Measure-Implicit/238807&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with the IAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/08/smell-as-weapon-and-odor-as.html&quot;&gt;Smell as a Weapon, and Odor as Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; – This was from my two-part olfactory series, which covered the interesting history of  &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Olfaction_Warfare.html?id=Bmy4oQEACAAJ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Olfactory Warfare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g, stink bombs, stealth camouflage) and the use of smell in cinematic and VR contexts. {&lt;i&gt;or at least, it was interesting to me&lt;/i&gt;}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-big-bad-brain.html&quot;&gt;The Big Bad Brain&lt;/a&gt; – This featured a fun and catchy music video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIOaU7Sm-ZE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;High&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sir-sly.com/&quot;&gt;Sir Sly&lt;/a&gt;, which was an earworm for me. But too esoteric and not much staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/03/whats-popular-at-cns2017.html&quot;&gt;What's Popular at #CNS2017?&lt;/a&gt; – This falls under the perennially unpopular category of “yearly conference announcements”, which is only relevant around the time of the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/08/olfactory-deterrence.html&quot;&gt;Olfactory Deterrence&lt;/a&gt; – This was about the prospect of nuclear war and how putrid smells might deter the use of nuclear weapons, along with eradicating cavalier attitudes about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion: &lt;/b&gt;We can easily see some themes emerging: the IAT, olfaction, music videos, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society  meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; People are sick of the IAT, aren't thrilled about the sense of smell (especially in relation to nuclear war), and do not like music videos or CNS Meeting announcements. However, they do like meeting recaps, as shown by the popularity of&lt;span class=&quot;PostTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot;&gt; What are the Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;PostTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-big-ideas-in-cognitive-neuroscience.html&quot;&gt;The Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience, Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/29/16820474/2017-tech-recap-uber-scandal-waymo-lawsuits-travis-kalanick&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Verge 2017 tech report card: Uber&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; deserves special mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This one is from 2016, but it's a real eye-opener: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/the-not-so-wholesome-reality-behind-the-making-of-your-meal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Not-So-Wholesome Reality Behind The Making of Your Meal Kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/917722190463754240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The unbearable anxiety and grief of losing a close friend to cancer.

	<title>Brain Blogger: In a World of Never Ending Tension, Seek Compassionate Neutrality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23142</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/30/in-a-world-of-never-ending-tension-seek-compassionate-neutrality/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amidst the rising tensions in the world around us, people are finding themselves in the unique position of having to make hard decisions about choosing passive observation or active participation, causing some to toss their opinions into the fray of the multitude of voices speaking out within society today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to what we have been accustomed to living and being for several decades, the pendulum of Change has begun its swing towards the opposite direction. The social tension created from this shift in direction has many of us unsettled. Enough so that many of us have turned inward in order to make sense of our external reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to seek balance and stability is inherent within us as human beings. We are meant to understand the other person’s point of view and seek the middle ground in between our two views in order to create perspective. Out of that informed perspective, we make decisions on how to act, our behavior evolves from those decisions, and consequently, our lives come into being from those personal thoughts and actions. This is how human beings are naturally designed to grow, evolve, and become within a constantly ever-changing world. If we are in the &lt;em&gt;right place&lt;/em&gt; (along the spectrum of choices), &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the right time&lt;/em&gt; (to make a decision), &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;right action&lt;/em&gt; (behavior and action) &lt;em&gt;is effortless&lt;/em&gt; as we pivot our way into a greater life. This is one of the key tenets of my book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mydiamondquest.net/&quot;&gt;How &lt;/a&gt;Me Found I: Mastering the Art of Pivoting Gracefully Through Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compassionate Neutrality vs. “My Way or the Highway”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “Dual” means two or something composed of two parts – harmony and balance is achieved in the coming together. The word “Duality” is when the two parts are in opposition to each other – competitive adversaries moving away from each other towards extreme polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context, we are naturally hardwired to seek balance, “true inner balance”. Yet our external world is filled with ego-driven polarization ? “duality” ? the corrupted version of what “dual” really means. Because we are naturally designed to always seek balance (whether we are aware of it or not) and because the only constant we can expect in life is “Change”, then balance in an environment of dynamic change is achieved through a “two-party system”, a dual-system structure of compensating complimentary counterparts. As humans, psychologically our dual-system structure is the Ego-Heart handshake. This uniquely human complimentary relationship is inherent within what I call a “Natural Person”. To strive for continual balance is our natural state of mind in dealing with changing realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our society, in its current presence of mind, does not recognize that the ego and the heart has a dual-system relationship, meant to counter balance each other so that we humans can continue to evolve within an ever-changing dynamic environment. For many of us, as we age and grow, the individual personalities that we exhibit outwardly are the reflections of our egos maturing as we learn how to adhere to the conditional social norms set forth for us to survive and operate within society. In contrast to the “natural person”, this ego-developed persona is what I call our “Conditioned Personality”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the word “dual” has become synonymous with the word “duality”, “It’s my way or the highway,” or “I’m right, you’re wrong”. Absent of the true meaning of a two-party system of balance, we have disintegrated into a mindset of where everything is now seen from the corrupted filters of polarized duality. Collaborative and communal dialogue has given way to personalized monologues based on absolute judgment and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need to convince people that one way, and only one way, “my way”, is the cause for the rising tensions in the world today, as evidenced in the political, socio-economic, and ethno-diverse arenas of discussion. Unaware that balance is inherently a desire that we are hardwired for and ignorant that it is a partner to the heart, the ego interprets that innate desire as a need to convince others that its viewpoint is the right way to go and disregards, seeks to dominate, even eliminate the natural role the heart is meant to play. For the ego, all roads must lead to Rome and it is all about me, only me. There can be no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have individual egos; each convinced that its way is the correct way to go. Our own heartfelt knowing and the innate need for natural equilibrium have been mutated into a need to strive for a dominant view, absent of room for another view to exist. We have left the middle field in the center to take up position at either end of the playing field. As it meets resistance from other egos, our ego’s need for superiority can only lead to an outcome of aggressive force, more domination, and ultimately violence. We will kill to be right. We must be right at all costs. The end justifies the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the heart does exist and is very much a part of our physical and psychological makeup. It cannot be ignored, subjugated, or disregarded. Without the heart, we physically cease to exist. Without the heart, we have no conscience. It is through the heart that we connect to the greater wholeness of life in accordance to God, Nature, and the Universe, whichever you choose to refer to the larger part of who we are. The heart inherently knows that balance is necessary for our very own existence as a species. It defines our humanness, guides our humanitarian endeavors, and nourishes our humanity. It knows that it is the counterpart to the ego in a dual-system structure designed to move towards compassionate neutrality, thus bringing well-being into our lives. It is what allows us to respond to the environment in a nonjudgmental and loving way. It doesn’t need to be justified; it just needs us to be aware so that it can guide the ego towards creating a better life. Together, this heart-ego handshake is what allows us to make sense of what is happening in our extrinsic environment and make the right intrinsic decisions that can mutually benefit ourselves and others, not only ourselves. It is this communal awareness that we are both individually a person, and yet connected to each other as part of an overall human community, that gives us comfort that we are truly ever alone, unprotected, isolated, or abandoned. This awareness is the umbilical existence of our personality within the nesting doll collective of the human species. If we take care and look out for the welfare of others, then in turn we also receive benefit for our own self. Vice versa, if we look for balance within, then our external society also receives the benefit of that internal balance because we will emanate that behavior out into our external world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for us to de-escalate the rising tension and violence in the external world of our society today, we, as members of humanity, need to look within and seek balance the way a natural person would. We need to reestablish the dual-system structure of the ego-heart handshake through intention, voice, and action. Because we are human and inherently designed for balance, we will naturally always seek to return to a state of compassionate neutrality; regardless of how long it takes to do so and despite what our ego thinks. The pendulum will eventually swing from any extreme edge to the center fulcrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we are at the extreme edge of a pendulum swing (the ego’s viewpoint), the pull from the other extreme edge (the heart’s viewpoint) will become intense enough to cause the pendulum to begin swinging back to the center where the heart’s communal compassion and a neutral ego’s informed judgment jointly resides. It is Mother Nature’s way of ensuring survival in a dynamically changing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallacy of our egos not understanding this natural fundamental principle of life will cause us to resist that innate impulse of allowing the other viewpoint to change our mind. Instead, we will literally fight to enforce our viewpoint to maintain our position. We don’t want the pendulum to swing at all. We want to remain in status quo, defiant to the extreme, and will react violently, determined to maintain our current position, against all natural forces of movement. This is the cause of the rising tensions in our world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We All Have a Choice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, may I suggest that it is compassionate neutrality that we all seek, an aligned response to the natural forces of constant change occurring within our environment. It is what Buddhism calls, “the middle way”. It is operating from the center fulcrum of the pendulum swing, the vesica piscis of creation, the ability to see both sides and optimally benefit from the combined viewpoints. It is living life from both the macro and micro views of both the mountain peak and the valley below. This is how we survive, evolve, and grow as humans being humans, citizens of humankind, and as members of the human species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ho-ho-ho! Look what Santa brought us here! This awesome neuroscience blog has awoken from the master thesis-induced hibernation and is ready to bring the wonder of neuroscientific discovery to the masses again! What a great present! (I know, you might have asked for a new laptop or a promotion. Talk it out with Santa, I’m doing what I can here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this year (thankfully) nears its end I sampled some of the most interesting neuroscience studies of 2017 to make you go &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whoa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Buckle up kiddos, this one is gonna be quite a ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s get the really important stuff out of the way first: this year I &lt;s data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt; survived &lt;/s&gt; finished my master thesis and got a neuroscience degree! Without a doubt the most exciting piece of news far and wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.
The second most exciting piece of news (for all the psychedelics enthusiasts at least) is yet another study by London researchers which solidified the potential benefits of psilocybin (the active compound of magic mushrooms) for people with depression&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The scientists found that a single dose of psilocybin leads to an effect they described as a “reset” of the brain. All of the patients with treatment-resistant depression felt much better one week after the treatment and 47% reported feeling much less depressed even 5 weeks after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day after the trip scientists observed substantial changes in the functional connectivity of the brain -- that is, in the way brain regions talk to each other. For example, the regions shown to be communicating too much in depressed patients (fueling up rumination as they do) were much less talkative with each other after the trip. The extent of these changes also helped to predict whether a patient would still be less depressed 5 weeks after the experiment. Moreover, there was a decreased blood flow in amygdala, our fear center, which went along with reduced depressive symptoms. Can’t have depression if the fear center is starved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the after-the-trip changes were very different from during-the-trip changes (read up &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/5/18/science-of-being-high-your-brain-on-acid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested in what's going on in your brain &lt;em&gt;during the trip&lt;/em&gt;). This led to the assumption that psilocybin first causes an acute disintegration during the trip (networks fall apart, “I just talked to the Universe, man!!” etc.) followed by a post-trip re-integration where the parts come back together but in a better, less dysfunctional way (like maybe the thought pattern “My boss did not answer because HE HATES ME!!” is substituted by something… more reasonable), hence the “reset” term. Of course, there is still a lot of room for improvement but it seems that step by step we are nearing a new promising treatment for even the most stubborn of depressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.
Maybe even more exciting is that researchers have created a non-invasive brain-computer-interface (BCI) that allows communication with completely locked-in patients who have zero muscular control&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593#pbio.1002593.ref013&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If I was out for sensationalist headlines I would even say… there was some mind-reading involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there has been some progress allowing locked-in patients to communicate with the outside world&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17234696&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590968&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a meta study&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinph-journal.com/article/S1388-2457(08)00911-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; revealed that none of the options is optimal (for one, a good chunk of them is directed to people whose eye muscles were intact and are not appropriate for people who can’t move their eyes and blink). This is where the present study comes in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring changes in the electrical activity and blood oxygen level in the brains of 4 completely paralysed patients researchers were able to establish a binary “yes/no” communication with them. First, patients were repeatedly asked some basic questions and instructed to think “yes” or “no” as a response. An algorithm was then trained to differentiate between patterns of blood flow and electrical activity for both of these responses. Soon it was able to accurately recognise the patient’s thought answer in 70% of cases. Interestingly, all 4 patients thought a “yes” when asked whether they are happy. We should be happy too as this study is paving the way to establish -- at first a rudimentary -- communication with people who are harder to reach (as compared to patients who still can move the eyes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a demonstration of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.
Throw out your anti-age face cream! Scientists have managed to slow down aging by tweaking the brain! Okay, it is really easy to get carried away with sensationalism… Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, researchers have discovered that stem cells (a type of cell that can develop itself into many different cell types) in hypothalamus (brain region concerned with many bodily functions) regulate ageing&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23282&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The researchers noticed that these stem cells start to vanish from mice hypothalamus around 11 month of age (corresponding to around 40-50 in human years) and completely disappear by 22 months. Such signs of ageing like memory loss went along with the amount of the lost stem cells.                                                                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists then proceeded to remove or add stem cells to this region in order to speed up or slow down the ageing. Turned out that mice in whom the majority of stem cells was removed displayed premature ageing, got retired, complained about youngsters all day long and died significantly earlier. However, when stem cells were added mice showed better memory performance, did power walking, played bingo and lived 200 days longer compared to an average mouse. It has to be noted that the implantation only worked if the new stem cells were made to be resistant to inflammation as the age-related inflammation seems to interfere with the hard-working stem cells preventing their anti-age effect.&lt;br /&gt;There is still a long way to go before you can really throw away your anti-aging cream... but we are sure on our way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.
What do space travels hold out for us? Aliens? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v--IqqusnNQ&quot;&gt;Life on Mars&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqjDSbhobGY&quot;&gt;Planting potatoes on Mars&lt;/a&gt;? Before we can know for sure we need to find out what a prolonged stay in space will do to our brain. A NASA-funded study investigated just that and found that after being on the ISS for a while the brain gets -- quite literally -- spaced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, with no gravity to pull it down, the brain floats upwards in the skull. Unfortunately there was no second post-space scan to see whether it eventually returns to the normal position or whether it stays upwards, reaching for the stars. Secondly, a fold on top of the brain separating motor areas from the sensory ones (called the central sulcus) got compressed and became narrower. On a long mission this might lead to changes in the brain function. In some cases, the upward brain shift was also thought to be responsible for the increased pressure on the optic nerve leading to some extent of vision damage (which is often reported by astronauts). Last but not least, the vessels carrying the cerebrospinal fluid (which cushions our brain and helps with clearing out waste and toxins) got narrower too, whereas the CSF-filled areas in the brain got larger. As the disturbances in the CSF flow are linked to a lot of diseases such as Alzheimer’s it would be handy to find out whether they are cause or effect of these diseases before sending people out on years-long space missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More studies need to be done before we can know for sure what the the significance of these changes is or how the brain reacts to a reduced gravity environment (think Mars), but once we’re through we’re ready to boldly go where no man has gone before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I see a way to squeeze in some Bowie, I squeeze in some Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.
Normally, patients who have been in a vegetative state for more than a year are not very likely to regain consciousness which makes the case of a 35-year old French man even more stunning. After spending 15 years in a coma the patient partly recovered his consciousness after being subjected to electrical brain stimulation&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30964-8&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve played the central role in this miraculous recovery so let’s get to know this guy a little better.  Vagus nerve is a complex nerve running from your brain to several body areas and controlling unconscious body procedures such as heart rate. Moreover it is directly or indirectly connected to several brain areas including thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus all of which play important roles in conscious awareness. It also connects to locus coeruleus which plays a role in alertness and attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the researchers did was to zap this nerve every day for six months. Soon after the beginning of the treatment he started opening his eyes more often, while after one month he was able to track objects with his eyes and turn his head when requested. Electrical activity in his brain reflected these changes -- brain waves which have been absent before were now observed. Basically a shift from no consciousness to minimal consciousness occured, all thanks to the stimulation of one nerve. Despite apparent (albeit minimal) success it is a very long way before we can understand how and why exactly this worked (question about the nature of consciousness, everybody) and generalize it for other patients locked in the vegetative state. But hey, first steps and all!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Safety Nets: Travel After Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23235</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/29/safety-nets-travel-after-brain-injury/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s so much out there that beckons—family, friends, ethnic textiles, and, more recently, the writers’ world. I am compelled to answer the call—all the calls! I reject the invalid role that my bloody brain repeatedly tries to thrust on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to live a full life, I’ve had to learn to set up safety nets wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, I had no difficulty living a fast-paced life. I combined a full-time job with a variety of extra curricular activities including time-consuming hobbies, such as weaving and dragon boating. Travel was an integral part of my life, with trips to conferences,  workshops, and with family and friends at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the wake of my injury, I can’t do nearly as much. Tasks that in my past life were a matter of course, such as grocery shopping and driving, deplete my resources. Travel now drains me, especially when it involves flying. Contending with the high volumes of sensory input streaming in at airports and in flight wears me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to learn to apply coping mechanisms and compensation techniques to function with my damaged brain. Though pacing myself to prevent debilitating &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/26/understanding-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/&quot;&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; would seem easy to apply, for me, it is one of the hardest adjustments I’ve had to implement. When I travel, it’s especially difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m outside my home territory, having less control over the agenda hampers any attempts to slow down. Also, I don’t want people to worry. I don’t want to call attention to myself. I don’t want to miss out, and I don’t want to slow others down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another obstacle in my way is that future events, including possible sources of trouble, now mean less to me. As far as I’m concerned, much of the future is abstract. It’s as if the wiring between cause and effect, between my notion of past and future, is faulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trips often don’t seem real until I actually land at the destination. As a result, planning and preparations don’t make sense. I usually pack for an upcoming trip at the last moment, and when I finally get to it, I have to force myself to do it. In my mind, there’s no good reason for me to undertake a task that now feels so overwhelming in its complexity. Since the injury, poor organizational skills and the difficulties in managing high volumes of data—figuring out what I need to pack, how to arrange it in my luggage, what bags should I take—are daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, as I healed, I became better able to manage my bloody brain. I learned to set myself a list of unbreakable rules that help me prepare for trips. A side effect of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/01/traumatic-brain-injury-can-deep-sleep-be-neuroprotective/&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, a strong OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) streak, has a surprising benefit: I have a list of basics I need to pack that I follow religiously, plus a set way to organize items in my suitcase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rules also include arranging for safety nets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the trip to visit my family in Israel would be grueling. I knew better than to trust my own judgment. If I hoped to convince my bloody brain to cooperate, I needed someone to watch out for me, to keep me out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the trip to Israel, I spoke to my sister about my anxiety. She understood and empathized—she’s walked in my shoes. She too has cavernous &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/04/in-and-out-of-the-abyss-depression-after-brain-surgery/&quot;&gt;angiomas&lt;/a&gt; that have bled. Like me, she is often tempted to outpace herself. But unlike me she is assertive, and when all hell breaks loose with her bloody brain, she knows to take it easy and to rest despite outside pressure. I, on the other hand, have trouble protecting myself, no matter how bad shape I’m in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trip, she shielded me from ambitious plans from well-meaning family and friends who wanted me to participate in activities that would drain my resources. And she also shielded me from myself; I was excited to spend time with my family, not wanting to cause concern, reluctant to disappoint, and too willing to go along with the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the safety nets don’t always work. Some of the changes that the bloody brain brought about get in the way. I am more emotionally volatile now, and often, my emotions drive me instead of reason. In addition, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/22/uncovering-the-secrets-of-memory-to-reverse-damage-in-alzheimers-patients/&quot;&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and poor grasp of the connection between cause and effect often results in me downplaying potential difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first couple of days in Israel, I didn’t listen to my sister’s advice. I was sure I knew better and that I would be fine. Even after the bloody brain lashed out at me with a crippling headache, I felt that she was being overprotective. I did finally listen to her—not because I fully agreed with her, but because I didn’t want to upset her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my brain rewired post-injury, my memory and my ability to make connections improved. As my self-awareness grew and I became more in-tune with myself and the bloody brain, planning ahead was easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even now, more than a decade since the surgeries, when I realize that common sense says, “wait a bit, take a break, don’t do so much,” there is still a niggling little voice inside me telling me that it’s not &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; necessary. I still overstretch myself, though nowhere near as much as I used to. I’m doing better now, I’ll be fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, where did I put that safety net?&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Glioblastoma’s spectre in the Senate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135694</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With his right arm extended – pausing for just a moment – Senator John McCain flashed a thumbs-down and jarred the Senate floor. Audible gasps and commotion followed. At 1:29 am on 28 July, Senator McCain had just supplied the decisive “Nay” vote to derail the fourth and final bill voted on that night. With that, a seven-year pursuit to undo the Affordable Care Act had collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight of that moment was magnified by the circumstances under which Senator McCain had arrived in D.C. days earlier. After undergoing a supraorbital keyhole craniotomy to remove a five centimeter blood clot from above his left eye, McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme – the most aggressive primary cancer of the brain. Just two weeks later, McCain returned to Washington and made waves throughout the Senate chamber and the national health policy debate. Curiously, he may have been subtly drawing strength from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article/doi/10.1093/neuros/nyx545/4601766&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eerie history of American senators before him&lt;/a&gt; who — in the face of glioblastoma — lit up the Capitol in gripping, historical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy, made his courageous return in 2008, enduring the physical effects of glioblastoma to cast a deciding vote to advance a critical Medicare bill. McCain was there cheering on his old friend Kennedy when the entire Senate chamber engaged in a thunderous standing ovation upon his return. Kennedy, in turn, was on that same Senate floor in 1964, to witness the very first account of an active US Senator’s mettle when confronted with glioblastoma. For that remarkable story, we turn to Senator Clair Engle (1911-1964), whose poignant moment came during the most crucial moment in the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act, described by historian Dennis W. Johnson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;&quot;&gt;Promptly at 11:00 a.m., the clerk began calling the roll. “Mr. Aiken.” “Aye.” “Mr. Allot” “Aye.” When the clerk got down to “E”, the Senate reached a moment of high drama, rarely seen in its history. Senator Clair Engle, fifty-two, once a handsome and rugged liberal who had earned the sobriquet “Congressman Fireball,” was now a mere shadow of his once robust self. His fragile, wracked body slumped in a wheelchair, gently guided onto the Senate floor by an aide. Ten months earlier, Engle had undergone an operation to remove a malignant brain tumor; since then his condition had deteriorated to the point where he could not walk, could barely move his arms, and was unable to utter a word. Gallery spectators watched in respectful silence as several times Engle weakly lifted his crippled arm, pointed to his eye, and tried to mouth the word “Aye.” There were tears in the eyes of many of his distinguished colleagues. Senate procedure did not require that a vote be uttered out loud, and Engle’s vote was recorded in the “Aye” column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_135700&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-135700&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BrainCAConMark.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;GBM in the frontal right lobe as seen on CT scan by James Heilman, MD.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Engle’s vote, cloture was invoked, and a fierce 60-day filibuster by Southern segregationists was cut off – producing one of the 20th century’s towering legislative achievements, the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme, or glioblastoma for short, is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Originally named in part by Harvey Cushing, the “father of neurosurgery,” the tumor originates from primitive precursors of glial cells (glioblasts), and frequently takes on a highly variable appearance from the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and cysts (multiform). Glia (derived from the Greek word for “glue”) refers to cells that support neurons through various functions. These tumors have drawn significant attention due to their poor prognosis, yet patient outcomes have changed little as these aggressive tumors have evaded increasingly clever and sophisticated attempts at therapy over the last half-century. Researchers continue to work to gain new insights that may improve survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a devastating neurological disease. Most patients die within one year. Thus, a diagnosis of glioblastoma confers to the patient an ineffable load. In these moments, it is the duty of dedicated, compassionate clinicians to embrace a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated, and work until they can get back up and make sense of their existence. The decision and determination to find meaning in the precious time that remains requires great strength and the support of loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engle, Kennedy, and McCain, whether through a moving gesture or an expression of vitality, offer powerful examples of that strength. Though tragic, there is a poetic thread to how these men are connected over time and through service – each producing moments of inspiration, demonstrating what is possible even when facing terminal neurological illness.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Convincing the public not to engage in harmful drinking: a more challenging task than you might think</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/12/28/convincing-the-public-not-to-engage-in-harmful-drinking-a-more-challenging-task-than-you-might-think/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/drink-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beverage industry has done such a good job in convincing the public that sugary and alcoholic beverages are something they want to purchase and drink, it’s almost impossible with facts and arguments to convince them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not your imagination; populations around the world are getting fatter and sicker every year. Diabetes rates are skyrocketing, childhood obesity is at an all-time high, and waistlines are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be argued that multiple factors are responsible for this change in human health, it is undeniable that sugary, carbonated and alcoholic drinks contribute to a less healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly has the beverage industry pulled off this feat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word: marketing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there has been a multitude of studies conducted on how to use marketing campaigns to convince the public to do or buy something, in a unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4972-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; recently conducted by Dr. Melanie Wakefield and colleagues, the researchers looked at not what convinces people to drink, but what strategies convince the public most on why they should not add these toxic – but highly popular – liquids to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wakefield et al. set out to determine what would be most effective, from a public advocacy position, in convincing consumers to support taxation and sport sponsorship bans of these chemical drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9729 alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/Beer_mug_in_Tokyo_-_October_2017-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was designed in two waves; in the first wave, study participants were placed in different categories of exposure to health advocacy information. The different exposures were as follows: control messages (basic information of the public health issues associated with these drinks); standard policy arguments alone; standard policy arguments with an inoculation message; standard policy arguments with a narrative message; and standard policy arguments with an inoculation message and a narrative message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inoculation message is where the data presenter, by either audio or video means, will warn the listeners of what the other industry might say to counter their message, and why their message is wrong. A narrative message is defined as a story or experience from a person who has a personal connection to the policy, and is telling it from a personal standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the five groups were exposed to these messages, they completed questionnaires on what they thought of them, and how likely there were to influence their behavior and support of a public policy that made it more difficult for beverage companies to market their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second wave of the study, approximately two weeks later, these same participants completed the questionnaires after they had been exposed to the brand marketing of the beverage companies, to see if they could be swayed after they had been educated by the public policy advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this experimental setup is certainly interesting in terms of its impact on the drink industry, one can also see how this study can shed light on how to convince and educate the public on other pressing public matters, where a private industry has well established and deep rooted marketing campaigns in place to financially benefit corporations and combat any messages of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that advocacy messages incorporating inoculation or narrative components can increase public resilience to subsequent anti-policy messages. Across two policy domains (sugary drinks and alcohol) and tactics (taxation and sport sponsorship bans), inoculation and narrative messages &lt;em&gt;delivered separately &lt;/em&gt;were successful in countering the persuasive impact of opposing arguments from the sugary drink and alcohol industry as measured by participants’ level of support for the health policy being addressed in the message and the strength of their anti-industry beliefs after exposure to the anti-policy message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that there was limited evidence of immediate effects of the inoculation and narrative messages compared to the control, with some suggestion that the inoculation messages counter the persuasive messages of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, policy support and anti-industry beliefs were lower following exposure to the industry anti-policy messages at the second wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were a number of limitations to this study, it’s not hard to reconcile these results with what is occurring in the real world, and the ever increasing influence large corporations have on buying, eating, drinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the study cautions, important message effects can be overlooked when focused solely on the immediate effects of exposure to advocacy messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, not all of the results from this study were bleak; there is some evidence that dissemination of advocacy messages can work, though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Social Media Anxiety Disorders: What’s Going on in the Brain?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23207</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/27/social-media-anxiety-disorders-whats-going-on-in-the-brain/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Too much of anything can be dangerous, and social media is no exception. Today many of us spend more time on internet-enabled devices than even sleeping. Due to this overindulgence in social media and the internet, we may become socially reclusive rather than inclusive. This, in turn, may lead to various physical and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, around two billion residents of our planet are online. Hundreds of millions of emails and social messages are exchanged each day. Perhaps, this online over-engagement is becoming more of a problem. The amount of time we spend online and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/07/06/social-media-and-mental-health/&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; is increasing each year. It is estimated that most people spend more than two hours each day on social media in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although social media anxiety and addiction are still not recognized as individual disorders, most investigations support the view that mental issues related to internet overuse are on the rise. Moreover, it seems to be a particularly big problem in younger people. Most individuals nowadays have their first exposure to the internet while in school. Overuse of the internet may lead to problems with concentration, sleep deprivation, failure to exercise, anxiety, and even depression. Although studying the prevalence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/20/digital-dieting-to-prevent-life-destroying-internet-addiction/&quot;&gt;internet addiction&lt;/a&gt; or social media addiction is challenging, it could be affecting as many as 10% of people in certain sections of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is social media engagement a disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is social media engagement itself a disorder? Perhaps the answer is both yes and no. It is no secret that some people get too submerged in the internet and social media. They feel bad if they do not get likes or see negative comments on their posts, and may even get depressed. Many others, however, think that social media is helpful in overcoming loneliness and&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt; depression&lt;/a&gt;, having a positive effect on self-esteem. The supporters of social media are saying that the compulsion to go online is not associated with the kind of harm done by substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scientific review studies have provided mixed results, with only one thing certain: not all users gets depressed or feel anxiety with social media, but some do. For mental disorders related to internet abuse, as with any other psychological issues, there have to be predisposing factors like genetics, personality, lifestyle, other diseases, or a recent history of trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk factors and identification of social media disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the contradicting findings, there is still no doubt that social media disorder exists, and some people are at higher risk of developing it than others. Some individuals are more prone to get dependent on the internet, cultivate impulsive behavior, and are inclined towards risky internet use, as well as being more susceptible to social and emotional impairment, and even physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some tools and measures have been developed to qualify and quantify the disorders related to social media and internet overuse. One of the scales that can be used to measure social media disorder assesses several items over the period of one year—preoccupation, tolerance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/&quot;&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, persistence, displacement (neglecting other hobbies), problems (arguments on social media), deception, escape, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media addiction and neural changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some anatomical brain structures are well known to be associated with mood, emotion, and learning. Hence in one investigation, specific attention was given to the structures involved in the limbic system and reward pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 20 subjects known to be addicted to social media were examined for any morphological changes in the brain, with the help of MRI. The study identified changes characteristic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/17/deciphering-troubled-teens-risk-taking-behavior/&quot;&gt;impulsive behavior&lt;/a&gt;, with a bilateral decrease in grey matter in the amygdala without any changes in the nucleus accumbens. In contrast to other types of addiction, the anterior and mid-cingulate cortex was not found to be impaired in social media addiction, indicating that the inhibitor function of these structures is well-preserved in this condition. The study demonstrated both similarities and differences between the structural changes in the brain in social media addiction and in addiction related to substance abuse or gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other health aspects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is a powerful tool that affects multiple facets of life. It has an additive effect on our already increasing sedentary lifestyle. Hence it is not stretch of the imagination that is is related to increased risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/28/effect-of-obesity-on-human-brain/&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, cardiovascular ailments, and other non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who use social media too often are also more prone to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/02/cyber-psychology-part-ii-dealing-with-the-dark-mind-of-internet-trolls/&quot;&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. They may get involved in risky behavior more frequently. In some people, social media addiction may also lead to disturbed sleep patterns. Moreover, adolescents are considered to be at higher risk of developing an addiction to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of social media or internet addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of social media addiction-related pathologies depends on the nature of the problem. Although there is a lack of trials and evidence for treatment of social media-related mental issues, treatment is often a combination of pharmacological drugs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/05/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-bulimia-nervosa-a-success-story/&quot;&gt;cognitive-behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT)—the kind of treatment that has already shown efficacy in other types of addictions, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although at present there are very few clinical studies on the topic, one can surmise that social media-related addiction, anxiety, depression, and other mental issues are going to become more common. It would be unwise to think that of social media disorder as merely a habit, we should keep in mind the related structural changes in the brain, imparting serious problems for an affected person.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this (50th!) episode of Brain Matters, Anthony talks to Dr. Fred Wolf (Assistant Professor, UC Merced). Dr. Wolf is interested in how alcohol and other drugs of abuse change our genes when we take them. Using the fruit fly as a model organism, he is able to use powerful techniques to delve into the complex relationship between drugs, genes, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wolf helps run his own biology podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiobio.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RadioBio&lt;/a&gt;, with graduate students at UC Merced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music on today’s podcast was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kolezanka.bandcamp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;koleżanka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen and subscribe on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/brain-matters/id730239508?mt=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: New year, new you: 13 books for self-improvement in 2018</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135789</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/512969244/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, twitter highlighted the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fitness-wellbeing/news/a39139/2017-most-popular-new-years-resolutions/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular New Year’s resolutions for 2017&lt;/a&gt;—which included losing weight, reading more, and learning something new among the most common goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 2018 quickly approaching, people all over the world are taking the time to reflect on themselves and determine possible resolutions for the coming year. We’ve put together a reading list of self-improvement books to help our readers reflect and stick to their goals in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/boost-9780190661731&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost! How the Psychology of Sports Can Enhance your Performance in Management and Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Bar-Eli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes hidden, often neglected, psychological forces drive human performance. Drawing on his career as a sports psychologist, Michael Bar-Eli reveals the skills practiced by elite athletes, and explains how these same tactics can be applied in the boardroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/an-intelligent-career-9780190494131&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Intelligent Career: Taking Ownership of Your Work and Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Michael B. Arthur, Svetlana N. Khapova, and Julia Richardson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across industries, navigating career obstacles often proves to be difficult. &lt;em&gt;An Intelligent Career&lt;/em&gt; serves as a playbook for the modern worker: offering clear guidance and support on taking charge of opportunities, seeking continuous learning, collaborating with others, and determining when it is time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/thriving-under-stress-9780199934331&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thriving Under Stress: Harnessing Demands in the Workplace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas W. Britt and Steve M. Jex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplace stress is common. But does it help or hinder us? &lt;em&gt;Thriving Under Stress &lt;/em&gt;emphasizes the surprising ways that stress at work can be used to promote growth—including exercises to help improve the way we respond to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/finding-meaning-in-an-imperfect-world-9780190657666&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Iddo Landau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to meaning in life, we have let perfect become the enemy of the good; we have failed to find life perfectly meaningful, and therefore have failed to see &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; meaning in our lives. &lt;em&gt;Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World&lt;/em&gt; addresses this flawed mindset. With a mix of practical advice and examples from film, literature, and history, this book aims to help people who feel that their lives are not meaningful enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/night-call-9780190669638&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Call: Embracing Compassion and Hope in a Troubled World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Wicks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compassion is not easy. Although caring for family members, neighbors, and friends is a central part of a rewarding life, it can also lead to emotional fatigue, or “secondary stress.” In &lt;em&gt;Night Call&lt;/em&gt;, acclaimed psychologist Robert Wicks offers stories and principles gleaned over thirty years in the helping and healing industry. The book includes a “personal resiliency retreat,” a five-day guide to self-care and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From entrepreneurs to teachers, engineers to artists, almost everyone stands to benefit from becoming more creative. &lt;em&gt;Innovating Minds&lt;/em&gt; reveals a unique approach to harnessing creative ideas and putting them into action. It offers a fascinating exploration of the science of creativity along with new and valuable resources for becoming more innovative thinkers and doers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/seven-steps-to-managing-your-memory-9780190494957&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven Steps to Managing Your Memory: What’s Normal, What’s Not, and What to Do About It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew E. Budson, MD and Maureen K. O’Connor, Psy.D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age-related memory loss is common. But how much can be expected? To help you navigate through age-related memory loss, follow the seven factors of memory: (1) Learn what is normal memory, (2) Determine if your memory is normal, (3) Understand your memory loss, (4) Treat your memory loss, (5) Modify your lifestyle, (6) Strengthen your memory, (7) Plan your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mindlessness-9780190200626&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mindlessness: The Corruption of Mindfulness in a Culture of Narcissism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas Joiner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of mindfulness has become a key approach to addressing life’s challenges. But have we gone too far? Using examples from popular culture, literature, and social media, &lt;em&gt;Mindlessness &lt;/em&gt;exposes the misuse of mindfulness, and considers how we as a society can salvage this valuable technique for improving mental and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-character-gap-9780190264222&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Character Gap: How Good Are We?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Christian B. Miller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think of ourselves, our friends, and our families as decent people. However, hundreds of recent studies in psychology tell a different story: that we all have serious character flaws that prevent us from being as good as we think we are—and we often do not even recognize that these flaws exist.&lt;em&gt; The Character Gap &lt;/em&gt;draws on the latest research in psychology to show how most people are not good enough to be virtuous but not bad enough to be vicious, and offers practical strategies for trying to become better people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/good-people-bad-managers-9780190652395&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good People, Bad Managers: How Work Culture Corrupts Good Intentions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Samuel A. Culbert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s far more bad management behavior taking place today than the well-intentioned doling it out realize. With MBA programs focusing on “success” skills, far too many graduates are entering the workforce without well-practiced managerial skills. &lt;em&gt;Good People, Bad Managers &lt;/em&gt;addresses this issues by breaking down the bad habits of today’s managers, and offering practical advice for achieving change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/when-doing-the-right-thing-is-impossible-9780190657581&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Doing the Right Thing Is Impossible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Lisa Tessman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what most moral philosophers believe, there are situations in which doing the morally right thing is impossible. Drawing on real-world examples, &lt;em&gt;When Doing the Right Thing Is Impossible&lt;/em&gt; explores how and why human beings have constructed moral requirements to be binding even when they are impossible to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. &lt;em&gt;The Elephant in the Brain&lt;/em&gt; confronts our hidden motives directly: tracking down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blasting them with floodlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/presence-9780199395606&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presence: How Mindfulness and Meditation Shape Your Brain, Mind, and Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Verhaeghen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness and one of the roads to it, meditation, have become increasingly popular as a way to promote health and well-being. &lt;em&gt;Presence &lt;/em&gt;integrates meditation concepts and research evidence from cognitive psychology and neuroscience literature to help you better understand the science of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/celldance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Celldance video program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides participating labs financial support to develop video stories of their cell motility research, in addition to post-production assistance for sound and editing services. PLOS supports this ASCB &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/community-committee/public-information/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Public Information Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program that helps showcase the value of basic research, aids in communicating complex scientific concepts to the public and provides scientists a unique opportunity to fine-tune their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;communication skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, two labs working in collaboration and a third lab developed Celldance videos for presentation at the joint ASCB|EMBO 2017 Annual Meeting. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dyche Mullins’ lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fritzlaylinlab.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lillian Fritz-Laylin lab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, created a video honoring foundational research on actomyosin and muscle movement by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/WG/p-nid/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert Szent-Gyorgyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and describing how the molecules that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020091&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constitute the cell’s skeleton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or cytoskeleton, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000201&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;influence the way a cell moves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through both wide open and narrow matrices. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/pathogenesis-of-vascular-infections/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guillaume Duménil lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the Institut Pasteur created a video that emphasizes the value of cohesive basic and clinical research programs and describes the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003139&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;group’s studies on infection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; caused by the Gram-negative bacterium &lt;em&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/em&gt;, responsible for meningitis and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the Mullins lab submitted work to the ASCB Celldance contest was to be able to convey the fundamental importance of molecular and cellular motion to a general audience. Mullins appreciates that fundamental problems in cell biology are often challenging to explain to non-specialists. Article types such as PLOS Research Matters, for both &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/research-matters&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/research-matters-biology&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, can help in this regard, by enhancing public understanding of science and the benefits of basic research to public health, society, life, and the environment. In addition, “A short film can explain concepts that are extremely difficult to convey in a brief elevator conversation or even a long lecture,” says Mullins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paring down several initial ideas the group wanted to convey was key to creating a coherent narrative. The team decided to begin with the importance of molecular and cellular motion, then to introduce the idea that “this is a universal feature of life, even microscopic life living in ponds,” says Mullins. Once the images were in place, the team experimented with audio voice-overs but eventually settled on captions to guide the viewer through the story. “It’s like an old-fashioned silent movie,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7937&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2PTujWh81c&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7937 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;155&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/12/mullins-300x155.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2PTujWh81c&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We Know Life by Motion; Mullins/Fritz-Laylin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even scientists need help understanding what they see under the microscope. Fascinating &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/at-work/test-and-measurement/crafting-light-to-illuminate-life-from-single-molecules-on-up&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3D lattice light sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; movies of crawling cells from the Fritz-Laylin lab were also motivation for wanting to participate in Celldance. “There is so much information in these movies that we had a hard time understanding what we were seeing,” says Mullins. By enlisting the help of visualization experts, the research teams could “suddenly see a wealth of new details. We were no longer seeing cells as ghostly apparitions, barely discernible at the business end of a microscope, but as real, three-dimensional beasts. We wanted to share this experience with a wider audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7957&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af-kolng-Ys&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7957 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/12/dumiel2-300x152.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af-kolng-Ys&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/em&gt;: At Home in Human Capillaries; Duménil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Duménil of his Celldance experience, “From a scientific point of view, I find it useful to see an infection as a story that starts with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000314&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;encounter of the pathogen and its host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the story develops with the different stages of the infection, cellular barriers are crossed, cells invaded, organs infected and the outcome can be happy or sad.” For Duménil, the opportunity was not only about explaining science to the public in an accessible format. It was also, he says, “an opportunity to show the people who do the actual research and our lab environment at the Institut Pasteur.” For more on the work of the Duménil lab and their video, see the partner Celldance blog on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2017/12/22/2017-ascb-celldance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(text and link updated 1/2/2018).&lt;/p&gt;

It has a reputation as the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207017794&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fear center&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438896800766&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotion center&lt;/a&gt;” of the brain, although it performs &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1965-04035-001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;as we've known for well over 50 years&quot;&gt;multiple functions&lt;/a&gt;. One well-known activity of the amygdala, via its connections with other &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoville.ucsd.edu/PDFs/177_Squire%20&amp;amp;%20ZolaMorgan_Sci_1991.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Medial Temporal Lobe Memory System (PDF)&quot;&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; areas, involves an enhancement of memories that are emotional in nature (compared to neutral). Humans and rodents with damaged or inactivated amygdalae fail to show this emotion-related enhancement, although memory for neutral items is relatively preserved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10456070&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adolphs et al., 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9115384&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Phelps &amp;amp; Anderson, 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754441&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McGaugh, 2013&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new brain stimulation study  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) raises interesting questions about the &lt;i&gt;necessity&lt;/i&gt; of subjective emotional experience in the memory enhancement effect. A group of 14 refractory epilepsy patients underwent surgery to implant electrodes in the left or right amygdala (and elsewhere) for the sole purpose of monitoring the source of their seizures. In a boon for affiliated research programs everywhere, patients are able to  participate in experiments while waiting around for seizures to  occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stimulating electrodes were located in or near the basolateral complex of the amygdala (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15084662&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;important for conditioned fear memories&quot;&gt;BLA&lt;/a&gt;), shown below. The stimulation protocol was developed from similar studies in rats, which demonstrated that direct electrical stimulation of BLA can improve memory for non-emotional events when tested on subsequent days (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22141467&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bass et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211699&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOvJ_UO7ae4/WjnZdHYZzWI/AAAAAAAAMXw/0QSnJ2lAu2YYp2Mb-J0WpKBsKzhFOFyWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig1_Inman_anatomy.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;310&quot; data-original-width=&quot;667&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOvJ_UO7ae4/WjnZdHYZzWI/AAAAAAAAMXw/0QSnJ2lAu2YYp2Mb-J0WpKBsKzhFOFyWQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig1_Inman_anatomy.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 1A and B (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; A representative postoperative coronal MRI showing electrode contacts in the amygdala (white square). &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; Illustration of left amygdala with black circles indicating estimated centroids of bipolar stimulation in or near the BLA in all 14 patients. White borders denote right-sided stimulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direct translation from animals to humans is a clear strength of the paper (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...direct activation of the BLA modulated neuronal activity and markers of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex, two structures important for declarative memory that are directly innervated by the BLA.  ... These and other studies [in animals] have led to the view that an emotional experience engages the amygdala, which in turn enhances memory for that experience through modulation of synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in other brain regions. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This model predicts that direct stimulation of the human amygdala could enhance memory in a manner analogous to emotion’s enhancing effects on long-term memory. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experimental task was a test of object recognition memory. Pictures of 160 neutral objects were presented on Day 1 while the participants made “indoor” or “outdoor” decisions (which were quite ambiguous in many cases). The purpose of this task was to engage a deep level of semantic encoding of each object, which was presented for 3 seconds. Immediately after stimulus offset for half the items (n=80), a train of electrical stimulation pulses was presented for 1 second (each pulse = 500 μs biphasic square wave; pulse frequency = 50 Hz; train                                     frequency = 8 Hz). For the other half (n=80), no stimulation was presented. Each trial was separated by a 5 second interval. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BoCqud2oPuk/WjnZj9jgsCI/AAAAAAAAMX0/Pe0s-9Xuz50Y2n0XQYaiA1T0M-GCkQUrQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig1_Inman_task%2Bdesign.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;398&quot; data-original-width=&quot;657&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BoCqud2oPuk/WjnZj9jgsCI/AAAAAAAAMX0/Pe0s-9Xuz50Y2n0XQYaiA1T0M-GCkQUrQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig1_Inman_task%2Bdesign.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 1D (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An immediate recognition memory test was presented after completion of the study phase. Yes/no decisions were made on 40 old objects with post-stimulation, 40 old objects with no stimulation, and 40 new objects (“foils”). Then 24 hours later, a similar yes/no recognition test was presented, but this time with the other set of items not tested previously, along with a new set of foils. The prediction was that electrical stimulation of the amygdala would act as an artificial “boost” of performance on the 24 hour test, after memory consolidation had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This prediction was (mostly) supported as shown below, with one caveat I'll explain shortly. In &lt;b&gt;Panel A&lt;/b&gt;, a commonly used measure of discrimination performance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://memory.psych.mun.ca/models/recognition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;d prime&quot;&gt;d′&lt;/a&gt;) is shown for the Immediate and One-Day tests, with &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;red dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; indicating stimulation and &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;blue dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; no stimulation (one dot per patient). Most participants performed better on stimulated items regardless of whether on the Immediate test or One-Day test, although variability was higher on the Immediate test. &lt;b&gt;Panel B&lt;/b&gt; shows a summary of the performance difference for stimulation &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt; no stimulation trials. Paired-samples &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests (two sided) were conducted for each recognition-memory interval. The result for One-Day was significant (p=.003), but the result for Immediate was not (p=.30). This would seem to be convincing evidence that amygdala stimulation during encoding enhanced delayed recognition memory &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;selectively&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hWAPeB5u7L4/WjnZm6qDwsI/AAAAAAAAMX4/XdPpbxOhzw8FYhNy3JX19Rqn0hbQFJycQCLcBGAs/s1600/Brief%2Belectrical%2Bstimulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bamygdala.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;538&quot; data-original-width=&quot;652&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hWAPeB5u7L4/WjnZm6qDwsI/AAAAAAAAMX4/XdPpbxOhzw8FYhNy3JX19Rqn0hbQFJycQCLcBGAs/s400/Brief%2Belectrical%2Bstimulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bamygdala.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 2A and B (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, from the statistics presented thus far, we don't know whether the memory enhancement effect was &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;statistically&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; larger for the One-Day test. My guess is not, because an ANOVA showed a main effect of test day (p&amp;lt; 0.001) and a main effect of stimulation (p= 0.03). But no interaction between these variables was reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the study was fascinating because the patients were unable to say whether or not stimulation was delivered in a subsequent test of awareness (10 trials of each condition):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;All 14 patients denied subjective awareness of the amygdala stimulation on every trial. In addition, no patient  reported emotional responses associated with amygdala stimulation during the stimulation awareness test or during  recognition-memory testing. Moreover, similar amygdala-stimulation  parameters caused no detectable autonomic changes in patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7) undergoing stimulation parameter screening.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The take-home message is that subjective and objective indicators of emotion were not necessary for amygdala stimulation during encoding to enhance subsequent recognition &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of neutral material&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. “This memory enhancement was accompanied by neuronal oscillations during retrieval that  reflected increased interactions between the amygdala, hippocampus, and  perirhinal cortex”&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (as had been shown previously in animals).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it seems that subjective emotional experience may be an unnecessary epiphenomenon for the boosting effect of emotion in the formation of declarative memories. Or at least in this limited (albeit impressive) laboratory setting. And here I will step aside from being overly critical. Anyone who wants to slam the reproducibility of an n=14 rare patient sample size should be prepared to run the same study with 42 individuals with amygdala depth electrodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;For [n = 5 patients] with electrodes localized concurrently in the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal cortex), local field potentials (LFPs) from each region were recorded simultaneously during the immediate and one-day recognition-memory tests...

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Some of the mysteries of good character</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=135545</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/512475384/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of character is one of the oldest in both Western and Eastern thought, and has enjoyed a renaissance in philosophy since at least the 1970s with the revival of virtue ethics. Yet, even today, character remains largely a mystery. We know very little about what most peoples’ character looks like. Important virtues are surprisingly neglected. There are almost no strategies advanced by philosophers today for improving character. We have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know, though, that matters of character are vitally important. Consider the news these days, dominated by people like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. Or consider the behavior of our heroes, like Lincoln and King, or our villains, like Hitler and Stalin. Or consider the latest scandals in the entertainment world, professional sports, or politics. So much of what has happened can be traced back to the character of the people involved. And to take it one step further, thanks to the latest psychological research, character traits have been linked to all kinds of things that we care about in life: optimism, academic achievement, mood, health, meaning, life satisfaction…the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that philosophers—who have been studying character extensively for thousands of years—are mostly in the dark about the topic, surely sounds like I am exaggerating, right? Maybe that’s true, but let me offer two concrete illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Neglected Virtues.&lt;/strong&gt; The moral virtues are good character traits like justice, temperance, and fortitude. Here are two questions (among many others) you can ask about these virtues. First, conceptually, what do they involve? How, for instance, would you characterize a temperate person? Or a heroic one? Secondly, on empirical grounds, do people actually have the virtues (and if so, how many people and which virtues)? For instance, are there actually any temperate people today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with the empirical question, there has been a recent flurry of interest among philosophers in consulting studies in psychology, and thinking about whether the behavior displayed in those studies is virtuous or not. For a virtue like compassion, real progress has been made in reading the relevant studies carefully, with the conclusion being that most people are not in fact compassionate. Unfortunately, philosophers don’t have much of an idea about what is going on empirically with most of the other virtues (and I’m not sure anyone else does either, for that matter). Part of the reason why is that for some moral virtues there just isn’t the wealth of existing studies to analyze, in the way that there is for compassion. Stealing is a good example—as you might imagine, it is hard to do helpful experimental studies of theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But part of the reason is also that some virtues have simply not been on our philosophical radar screens. The attention of philosophers has been elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DLoMftoEAqw.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;Carte de visite of Sojourner Truth by unknown. Public domain via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sojourner_Truth_01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the virtue of honesty, for instance. If any virtue is on most people’s top five list, it is that one. Yet it has had no traction at all in the philosophy literature. In fact, there has not been a single paper in a mainstream philosophy journal on the moral virtue of honesty in over fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take the virtue of generosity—just three papers in the past forty years (by way of comparison, there are over two dozen papers on the virtue of modesty—who would have expected that to happen!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the upshot is that compassion is likely to be a rare virtue. But at this point it is not at all clear how we are doing with the rest of them. Indeed, in some cases we are not even clear what the virtues look like in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Virtue Development.&lt;/strong&gt; The natural suspicion, of course, is that across the board we are not doing very well when it comes to being people of good moral character. History, current events, the local news, and social media all seem to confirm this. Hence it seems apparent that there is a sizable character gap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DLoYEJnpDVs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;327&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are moral exemplars, people like Abraham Lincoln and Sojourner Truth, whose character is morally virtuous in many respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining their lives ends up reflecting badly on most of us, myself included, since it illustrates in vivid terms just how much of a character gap there really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to at least reduce this gap, it would be helpful to have some strategies which can, if followed properly, help us to make slow and gradual progress in the right direction. Naturally philosophers needn’t be the only ones who can come up with these strategies, but it would be nice if we had something to say that is practically relevant, empirically informed, and actually efficacious if carried out properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and large, we haven’t had much to say. But there are signs that this is beginning to change, thanks to the work of Nancy Snow, Julia Annas, Jonathan Webber, and a few others. In fact, the development of character improvement strategies strikes me as one of the most promising areas of philosophy in the coming decade. Many good and innovative dissertations are there for interested graduate students to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this groundswell of interest in how to cultivate the virtues will continue to expand in the coming years. These are indeed early days in the philosophical study of character. And exciting days too, full of so many worthwhile possibilities to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
