&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half of people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have extreme fears about touching something they feel is “contaminated”. This can mean that after touching a doorknob, say, they then feel compelled to scrub their hands, in some cases even until they bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional treatments, which often involve a combination of a prescription drug (typically an “SSRI”, such as Prozac) plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), help &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonathanhaverkampf.ie/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Treatment-Resistant-OCD-CJ-Haverkampf-J-Psychiatry-Psychotherapy-Communication-2014-Sep-30-3391-94.pdf&quot;&gt;only about 60 per cent of people&lt;/a&gt; with OCD, so there’s an urgent need for additional treatments. Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33142-2&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, Baland Jalal at the University of Cambridge and colleagues present initial data suggesting that a simple video intervention, delivered via a phone app, might help.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35289&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exploratory study, the researchers recruited 93 people from the local community with higher than average fears about contamination but without a diagnosis of OCD. The researchers made this recruitment decision in case their experimental treatment inadvertently worsened their participants’ symptoms, which would likely have been more serious for people with full OCD. But thankfully, as hoped, their intervention was helpful – after just a week, participants in the two intervention groups showed significant improvements, whereas members of the control group did not.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial began with all the participants completing an initial battery of questionnaires and a clinical interview. The participants in the two intervention groups were then videoed for 30 seconds either touching toilet paper inside a bedpan that had been mocked up to look and smell as though it contained faeces, or washing their hands in a sink. The control participants were videoed making arbitrary hand gestures. These videos were then loaded into a smart-phone app, and on four occasions each day over the next 7 days, all the participants were then prompted, via the app, to watch their personalised video.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the bedpan video was designed to be a potentially much less confronting, less time-consuming (and also less expensive) version of standard exposure-based CBT therapy. This involves progressively exposing the client to a “contaminated” object (like a toilet seat), which generates anxiety – but preventing them from washing themselves. By allowing clients to feel the eventual decrease in their anxiety levels, even in the absence of the washing, therapists help them to learn to overcome their contamination fears. The hand-washing video was designed with the hope that it would allow a kind of vicarious cleansing, assuaging the individual’s concerns about contamination without them having to actually go and wash their hands.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eighth day, all the participants came back into the lab for follow-up testing. Both intervention groups showed a significant decrease in OCD symptoms, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. They also got better at a test of cognitive flexibility, which entails being able to shift attention as a situation changes. Their scores on the contamination fears scale did not decrease, but that might be because a week wasn’t long enough for them to recognise changes within themselves, the researchers suggest. (Members of the control group showed no changes on any of the measures.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several participants described their own experiences. One in the hand-washing condition reported: “It felt as if I had washed my hands, so I didn’t need to wash my hands anymore…my hands were clean after using the app”. A member of the bedpan group said: “I have become desensitised to the video and other things as well. If I normally were to wipe a kitchen worktop, I would throw the cloth away because I felt it was disgusting to clean that cloth for another time. But since using the app I now use the cloth, clean it, and use it again another time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is of course to investigate whether these interventions really can work as a treatment for OCD. As the researchers write, they are certainly worth investigating further, in part because they “are not only inexpensive and accessible but can be tailored for individual patients. They also have the potential for widespread implementation and could potentially reach communities that do not have access to adequate mental health care.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33142-2&quot;&gt;Novel Smartphone Interventions Improve Cognitive Flexibility and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Symptoms in Individuals with Contamination Fears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Exploring cancer risk in men on International Men’s day</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10679</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/19/exploring-cancer-risk-men-international-mens-day/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/AdobeStock_86183613-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle and healthcare interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking alcohol are related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2018/03/23/new-calculations-confirm-lifestyle-changes-could-prevent-4-in-10-cancer-cases/&quot;&gt;4 out of 10 cancers&lt;/a&gt; and men are more likely to have at least one or more of these risk factors. Taking tobacco as an example, smoking in men has had a significant impact on the rates of certain cancer types, particularly lung, head and neck, bowel, bladder, pancreatic – cancers that can have particularly poor outcomes. Fortunately, smoking rates in men are now steadily falling and we’re starting to see a subsequent decline in the incidence of some of these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential reason is that men are less likely to have as many opportunities for contact with health professionals across their lifetime in order to obtain health information or to report possible cancer-related symptoms. Women are more likely to have frequent contact on matters relating to contraception, pregnancy, child rearing or menopause and they have also had exposure to healthcare professional through participating in breast (and cervical) cancer screening for the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men have only recently had the opportunity to participate in such programs in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/&quot;&gt;bowel cancer screening&lt;/a&gt;, but the test is conducted at home, which further limits opportunities for healthcare professional contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about inherent differences between the sexes, could they be responsible for some of these differences in cancer rates? Sex hormones, including oestrogens (the primary female sex hormone) and testosterone (the primary male sex hormone), are related to sex-specific cancers such as breast in women and prostate in men but surprisingly, little research has been conducted to see if they are involved in the development of cancers that affect both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers of the oesophagus (or food pipe) and stomach are particularly more common in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-12-11&quot;&gt;men than in women&lt;/a&gt; and are cancers which are linked to poor outcomes. The difference in rates between the sexes is especially pronounced for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adenocarcinoma&quot;&gt;adenocarcinomas&lt;/a&gt;, the type that most commonly occurs in developed countries, with reports estimating up to a 7-fold difference in men compared to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variation by sex is not fully explained by known risk factors such as smoking, obesity and gastroesophageal reflux and the male-to-female ratio is highest during female reproductive years, when oestrogen concentrations are highest. But it’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study of reproductive and hormonal factors in men, we recently found that male pattern balding (used as a proxy for higher testosterone levels) was associated with a small increase in risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.31375&quot;&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt; and was more marked for adenocarcinomas among men enrolled in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a large UK cohort study. To investigate this further, we are conducting studies to examine the use of common hormone-modulating medications, in addition to circulating blood levels of sex hormones, in both men and women to see how these may impact subsequent risk of these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research, along with the work of others, will provide insights into the possible biological reasons for the difference in oesophageal and stomach cancer rates between men and women and in the future, could lead to the identification of potentially exploitable prevention strategies. It’s important to point out though that this work is still very much in the early stages and additional research is required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can men do to reduce cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there is one single cause as to why men develop cancer more frequently compared to women. In addition to the investigation of potential biological factors, it’s clear that we need a focus on cancer prevention and early diagnosis and campaigns such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/be-clear-on-cancer&quot;&gt;Be Clear on Cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the UK are trying to address this – but increased and sustained efforts are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on this International Men’s Day, what can men do to reduce their overall risk of developing cancer in the future? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-prevention-recommendations&quot;&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;’s evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyle choices include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be physically active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat wholegrains, vegetables, fruits and beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the consumption of “fast-foods”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit consumption of red and processed meats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit alcohol intake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to healthy lifestyle choices, it’s important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/mens-health/cancer-facts-for-men.html&quot;&gt;know yourself&lt;/a&gt;, your family history, and to tell your doctor if you notice a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-symptoms/spot-cancer-early&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; which isn’t normal for you, such as a persistent cough, change in bowel movements or difficulty swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>What should a doctor do if a dying patient confesses to killing people decades ago? This is the question posed by a fascinating case report in the Journal of Clinical Ethics, from New Zealand-based authors Laura Tincknell and colleagues.




The facts of the case are fairly straightforward. A 70-year old man with advanced cancer was expected to die imminently and was admitted to a hospital pallative care ward in severe pain. While being assessed by a junior doctor, the man expressed a wish</description>

	<title>Open and Shut?: The OA Interviews: Arul George Scaria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7961882.post-5528503932216638976</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One common criticism of the open access and open science movements is that they tend to take a standardised view of science and scholarship, and so propose one-size-fits-all approaches when advocating for ways of making research and the research process more open and transparent. This often poses significant challenges for, for instance, researchers in non-STEM disciplines. It is also often deeply problematic for those based in the global South.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O2zrNqB3vU4/W_Fup9Qi3RI/AAAAAAAAh9o/akYiLGG0Q1MmS4xYSSMwYNta9c2FmvqjwCLcBGAs/s1600/Logo.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;309&quot; data-original-width=&quot;334&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O2zrNqB3vU4/W_Fup9Qi3RI/AAAAAAAAh9o/akYiLGG0Q1MmS4xYSSMwYNta9c2FmvqjwCLcBGAs/s200/Logo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is one of the reasons why open access has become a source of considerable conflict and divisiveness, particularly as more and more researchers find themselves subjected to increasingly demanding and standardised OA mandates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, while many scientists (but by no means all) may be willing to make their work available with a CC BY licence attached, those working in arts, humanities and social science (AHSS) subjects often object strongly when told they must do so – usually for &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13555502.2013.865981?src=recsys&quot;&gt;good reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, the increasing move to pay-to-publish gold OA poses serious problems for those without access to the necessary funds to pay the associated publishing costs. With growing calls for a global flip of all subscription journals to a pay-to-publish model, this is now a very real issue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, it is those working in AHSS and the global South who are particularly challenged by this development.

It was never a talking point since most of my colleagues did not even realise that the crisis existed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps it was internalised as one among the many life-struggles and everyday bureaucratic trials that one has to live with and undergo in a country like India. Most research mentors also did not push students to go beyond materials that are easily accessible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when I moved for my doctoral studies to the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ip.mpg.de/en.html&quot;&gt;Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Munich, I could see how much effort a country like Germany has been putting into making knowledge more accessible to the public, in spite of the fact that Germany is a far more economically wealthy country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here I’m talking not just about the specific open access initiatives we see in Germany, but also about the excellent network of public libraries which make knowledge accessible for the broader public. This prompted me to open myself up to the growing number of open access initiatives across the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequently, as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Catholic University of Louvain (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html&quot;&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in Belgium, under the guidance of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biogov.uclouvain.be/staff/dedeurwaerdere/tom.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Tom Dedeurwaerdere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I had an opportunity to learn a lot more about diverse open movements and to read closely the works of scholars like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&quot;&gt;Prof. Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this convinced me how exigent inclusive knowledge production is for countries like India. On my return to India and my joining the National Law University in Delhi, open science naturally became a compelling research priority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I prefer to call myself an open science advocate, as open science is a much broader movement than open access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With regard to the third part of your question, yes, there are obvious advantages to open access. The traditional methods of access (which remains the contemporary research scenario in India) promotes exclusivity in access to knowledge as well as in the production of knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The open science movement challenges this by trying to make knowledge production more inclusive. It advocates for broader participation in the production of knowledge through diverse open initiatives. That’s the biggest strength I see the open science movement having. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Open access vs. open science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How would explain open access and open science – and how they differ/ interact with one another – to a layperson?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I would say the simplest but most comprehensive definition of open access I have seen is Prof. Peter Suber’s. His definition reads: “Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This definition can to a great extent also help us in differentiating open access from the broader concept of open science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the key focus of the open access movement is to make content available free of cost online, open science goes much beyond that and tries to make knowledge production more inclusive and transparent. So, open science encompasses all the ‘open’ movements, including open access, open data, open source software, and open lab notes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must add here that there is no single, comprehensive definition of open science. In our open science project, we defined it (based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TUgPNtjZUak753cHG0J6YnrjkR7rZpv0IteWxlbQIxI/edit#gid=223687104&quot;&gt;mapping of diverse definitions&lt;/a&gt; of open science available today) as “scientific inquiries wherein the characteristics of accessibility, transparency, usability, and non- or minimal existence of IP restrictions, are evident and exist throughout all stages of research. It is also characterised by openness to inclusiveness, collaboration, constant and continuous transfer of knowledge between producers and users of knowledge, and prioritisation of research and innovation based on social needs.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To summarise, open access is part of the broader open science movement and one cannot practise open science without open access. However, it may not be the case vice-versa. There are many scholars who have adopted open access, but they may not be practising open science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, people may share their scientific publications through open access repositories, but they may not make their works accessible to lay-people, or they may not support collaboration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: believe you take a particular interest in the copyright aspects of open science.

Over the years, most countries have added more and more layers of IP protection and extended the duration of protection for most subject matter. It is high time we asked ourselves whether we should continue with this IP maximalist approach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the specific context of copyright, it is important that we do not allow copyright law to prevent dissemination of knowledge resources. We need to broaden the exceptions and limitations under the copyright system so that we can regain a balance within the copyright system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the context of the broader open access and open science movements, we may even have to think about a shift from today’s automatic protection regime (i.e. copyright protection doesn’t require registration) to a registration/ renewal-based system for copyright protection. This would mean that more works would be available in the public domain without access and usage restrictions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Needless to say, this would require radical changes to the current multilateral legal system.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Research findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You were the principal investigator for the “Open Science India Report” (currently in draft form &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/aj9gw/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I believe this is based on a survey that set out to explore the current situation in India with regard to open science. Can you say briefly what your main findings were?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Yes, the report results from a survey we conducted among researchers in India working in different disciplines/ institutions. The data, in general, suggest that open science is yet to become a priority for most researchers. While it may not be possible to discuss all the findings, let me share some of the key findings: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The survey data show that while most researchers use publications and data which are accessible online, only a minority share their publications or data through open access repositories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While unwillingness to pay article processing charges (APCs) and an inability to pay these are cited by many as important factors dissuading them from sharing their publications, it is important to note that around 44% of respondents said that they would be prepared to share their data openly &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; when all the research and publications based on those data are completed. This reveals the “exclusivity” approach we currently follow with regard to knowledge resources! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In considering these responses we need also to be aware that for most researchers there will never come to a point in their academic life in which they feel that all potential research and publications based on their data have been completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would also note that our survey also shows that most of the researchers we surveyed did not see any benefit from sharing either publications or data!  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I noted, making knowledge production inclusive is an important aspect of open science. Unfortunately, our survey data also reveal that we as researchers are not taking sufficient steps to make science inclusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we take the case of people with disabilities as an example here: we still view such people as consumers of science and not potential producers. Thus, our survey data show that although many institutions have started to provide ramp and wheelchair facilities, only around 11% provide Braille textbooks and only around 18 % provide audiobooks. Don’t we need a change in this approach? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also found that most researchers are unaware of any institutional measures for making research outputs produced in their institution accessible to people with disabilities, further indicating that there are hardly any measures taken at the institutional level in this regard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We found a similar situation with regard to communicating science in a language accessible to the broader public. The survey data show that only a small number of researchers regularly share simplified versions of their research findings. In a multilingual country like India, it is also important to communicate science in regional languages in order for it to be accessible to the broader public. While some of our policymakers, including the current Principal Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister, have emphasised this aspect in many interviews and talks, our data show that the vast majority of respondents (around 79%) have never shared translated versions of their research in regional languages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The survey data also provide some insights into transparency-related measures taken by respondents. While close to half of them were of the view that the failure to reproduce scientific studies is a major problem in their field, the data also indicate that there are insufficient disclosure practices on the part of researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is, while most researchers reported that they share research methodology, most of them do not appear to be routinely sharing other important information like negative results and sources of funding. Yet these are integral to addressing the reproducibility crisis in science.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our survey data also show that most respondents are unaware of any mandates from their funding agencies or institutions with regard to the disclosure of research methodology, research tools, negative results, errors in research, errors in data, and other limitations.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To summarise, the overall scenario with regard to open science practices in India is not that promising and we need to take a lot more steps to make science open.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What recommendations do you make in the report, and to whom are these recommendations addressed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Our main recommendations are made in Chapter 4 of the report. So, we suggest that if Indian researchers want to address the crisis in science, we need a holistic and inclusive approach involving participation from all stakeholders. Hence our chapter is addressed to all the stakeholders in science including, but not limited to, researchers, policy makers, funding agencies, and institutions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from providing examples wherever possible with most of our recommendations, we have also tried to specifically mention what each stakeholder can do with regard to that recommendation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was done with the aim of not just making it easier for each stakeholder to understand what they can do, but also to convey to each stakeholder that their action is part of a broader set of actions required in that particular area.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main recommendations of the study include the need to create more awareness of the necessity for open science; to make openness and open science a priority in science at all levels; to introduce more robust open access, open data, open source software, and open hardware policies and practices; to have funding agencies, institutions and the government properly monitor and enforce such policies; to create shared resources; to fine-tune approaches towards IP (in particular, taking a more liberal approach to the limitations and exceptions under the copyright law); to introduce broader educational policy reforms to alleviate socio-economic barriers with regard to gender, caste, disability, etc. so as to make production of science more inclusive; to create facilities that enable the accessibility of knowledge resources for people with disabilities; to create incentives for sharing simplified and translated versions of research; to make research outputs available in machine-readable and interoperable formats; to enable a shift from pursuing sensational or “attractive” findings in favour of transparent and socially relevant research; to introduce and implement transparency-related mandates; to improve peer review; to encourage intra- and interdisciplinary collaboration; to share intermediate processes and findings; and to pursue more meaningful engagement with people outside the ‘mainstream’ scientific community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report also suggests the need for re-thinking the criteria used by policymakers, institutions, and funding agencies when evaluating the performance of researchers. We need a radical shift from the current approach which focuses solely on the number of publications, journal impact factor, number of patents, etc. Open science practices must be given due weight in the evaluation process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, the report points out that it may not be advisable or possible to transplant the approaches being adopted for open science in the global North to a country like India, where access conditions and socio-economic situations are vastly different. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the context of the global South, it is also important to focus on creating offline resources, and some of the specific suggestions we put forward in the report include a greater focus on print media, community radio stations, and creation of shared physical infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Offline open access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can you say a little bit more about offline open access resources and who would benefit from them? I assume this is intended to inform and educate the public, and perhaps “citizen scientists”, rather than researchers? Can you give me an example? Do you see this as a peculiarly Indian need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiankanoon.org/doc/560422/&quot;&gt;Art. 51 (h) of the Constitution of India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that it is the duty of every citizen to develop “scientific &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/temper&quot;&gt;temper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform”. Can the citizens of India develop this scientific state of mind without access to scientific knowledge? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a country like India, where the digital divide is substantial (some estimates suggest that only around 31% of the population in India has internet access, while a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/16/china-outpaces-india-in-internet-access-smartphone-ownership/&quot;&gt;2017 report from Pew Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suggest that only around 21% of adults in India use the internet at least occasionally or own a smartphone), it is extremely important to focus on alternative offline resources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way of doing this would be to share simplified versions of scientific information in print form. In fact, it should be mandatory to share simplified summaries of research produced in publicly-funded research and educational institutions. So doctoral candidates defending their theses could be asked to make a short and simplified presentation of their research on the thesis defence day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the more reputable universities (e.g. the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/&quot;&gt;University of Tilburg in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) are already insisting on this, and as a thesis examiner, I have witnessed how useful it is for both the public and the doctoral candidate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another important area where we need radical change is in providing access to libraries. In a country like India, it is important to invest in building an excellent network of public libraries across all villages and towns in the country. Every such library should be able to provide access to a good collection of books. Inter-library loans can facilitate this to a great extent, as the practices in German public libraries demonstrates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This network of libraries should also provide easy access to digital journals. The Government of India should use the power of collective bargaining to reduce the costs of both print and digital materials in this regard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to provide easy access to the libraries of publicly-funded educational institutions. While technically many of these institutions allow access to the public, they tend to put in place enormous bureaucratic procedures, including requiring recommendation and authorisation letters from faculty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why should the public need a recommendation letter before they can access materials bought using taxpayers’ money? It is high time to challenge and change such elitist practices in educational and research institutions in India.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I briefly indicated earlier, we should also try to make use of opportunities like community radio stations to communicate science to the broader public. Maybe specific incentives could be given to educational and research institutions to encourage this. We should also encourage them to communicate science in the context of local problems, with the use of local examples. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only through such diverse efforts will we be able to develop scientific temper in the country, as envisaged under the Constitution of India.     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Who funded your survey and report? Does it have any official status, and so require a response/ action from the Indian Government or from Indian institutions/ funders/ researchers? Or is it an advisory report?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The report is being produced under the aegis of the Centre for Innovation, IP and Competition, with the help of funding from Qualcomm Inc. It has no “official” status and is advisory in character. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, we hope that all stakeholders, particularly policymakers, funders and researchers, will read the report and work towards developing at least some of the solutions we discuss in the report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What would you say were the distinctive characteristics of the research and political environment in India that need to be considered when seeking to introduce open science practices in the country, and what are the distinctive challenges advocates for open science face?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; While there are many distinctive challenges to making open science the norm in India, I would suggest that two of them need specific mention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first one is the lack of awareness among researchers and policymakers that there is a serious crisis in science in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;During many of my interactions with researchers at different academic levels and different institutions, one thing I have observed is that although most of them have directly experienced at least one aspect of the crisis (for example, an inability to access relevant journal articles for their research and/or teaching), not many see it as an issue that needs to be urgently addressed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most Indian researchers silently accept the status quo, and many times they (unknowingly) contribute to the problem (by, for example, not sharing their publications and data). This issue has to be addressed. We need to create greater awareness in the hope of persuading more researchers to challenge the status quo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second issue is more complex: Some of the most experienced scientists and policymakers in India maintain strongly that there is no crisis in science in India, despite clear evidence of the magnitude of the problem. Some of them might be taking that position because they think that accepting the existence of the crisis is harmful to the image of science in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is very difficult to make meaningful change when policymakers take this attitude. Accepting the existence of a problem is the most important step in addressing it, and so open science advocates need to fight to change the attitude of policymakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;More challenges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said that it may not be advisable or possible to transplant the approaches to open science being developed in the Global North to a country like India. As you know, in Europe right now there is a new initiative called &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This aims to ensure that from 2020 all new research funded by a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot;&gt;growing number of funder signatories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is made freely available on the internet. Clearly, for Indian researchers as consumers of scholarly papers, it would be a positive thing if the Plan S objectives were realised. But if (as some argue it will) Plan S triggered a global flip of subscription journals to a pay-to-publish gold OA model it would presumably have a negative impact on researchers in India and the global South as authors of research, particularly if they need/want to publish in international journals. What are your views on Plan S and its likely impact on India and the global South? For instance, if pay-to-publish became the norm would not researchers in the global South find that they had to pay a lot of money to have their research published?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I have mixed feelings about Plan S. On the positive side, it is really great to see different national research funding agencies coming together and strongly asserting that the results from publicly-funded research must be communicated through open access journals or open access platforms from January 1, 2020. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I truly hope that this will incentivise more countries to join the open access movement. Only through such collective efforts will we be able to address the global crisis in access to knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also good to see that Plan S has taken a strong position against hybrid journals, as they often engage in double dipping (taking money both from contributors to the journal as well as from readers of the journal). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other side, we need to ensure that initiatives like Plan S do not incentivise a complete shift to the pay-to-publish gold open access model. This would certainly be detrimental to researchers in the global South, as it would mean that most would be unable to share their research due to the exorbitant charges imposed by publishers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It would also be detrimental to science in general, since science without the perspectives and participation of the global South is incomplete science, and in many cases also misleading science! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope that this danger of Plan S is given due attention during the implementation planning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way to address the issue is to promote green open access as a component of the implementation of Plan S – through the sharing of preprints in repositories for instance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other option would be to support researchers in different disciplines so that they can establish open access journals that do not charge APCs. This is practically feasible today as digital communication technologies have considerably lowered the cost of disseminating knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to note that most of the important aspects of the publication process (for example, the preparation of manuscripts and the review of manuscripts) are undertaken by researchers without remuneration. Given this, funding agencies could easily subsidise APC-free journals by underwriting the administration costs. It would also help establish excellent open and inclusive journals in diverse disciplines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other modes of communication, including the sharing of simplified versions of findings through social media, should also be emphasised in initiatives like Plan S with the aim of making science more inclusive.      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said some Indian researchers fear that the image of science in India will be harmed if they acknowledge that there is a crisis in the areas you mentioned. As you will know, pay-to-publish gold OA has encouraged the rise of a phenomenon that has been dubbed “predatory publishing”, and some maintain that India is a hotbed for predatory publishing. The Indian Government appears to have been &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06048-2&quot;&gt;struggling to tackle this problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Others, however, argue that so-called predatory publishing is not what critics claim and that many publishers and journals in the global South have been wrongly classified as predatory. What are your views on predatory publishing, the exact nature and extent of the problem (if you accept that there is one), and the impact it is having on the Indian research community?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Predatory publishing is an important challenge that needs to be addressed in India. Some studies have shown that India has the highest number of predatory publishers, and some show that Indian researchers are the greatest contributors to predatory journals. However, I feel these two issues need more deliberation if we want to address the challenge effectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, it is important to recognise that the issue of predatory publishing is not limited to open access journals. There are many closed-access publishers in India who will publish anything for a payment. So, in discussing the issue of predatory publishing we have to understand that this is an issue related to scientific publishing in general. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, we need to ask ourselves why predatory publishers have flourished in a country like India. And it is clear that the primary reason is the current incentive structure. When deciding whether to promote researchers most institutions in India use the Academic Performance Indicators (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmuniversity.nic.in/pdf/API_UGC_FORM.pdf&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) produced by the University Grants Commission (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)&quot;&gt;UGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). If one examines the API system, it is immediately evident that the focus is on quantity and not quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consequently, researchers are being given the perverse incentive of increasing the number of their publications and in doing so not many will have the time or patience to focus on quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Was this ever the purpose of science communication? The situation is alarming and only by means of radical change to the current incentive structure will we be able to address this issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said earlier that while the key focus of the open access movement is making content available free of cost online, open science goes well beyond this and aims to make the whole knowledge production process more inclusive and transparent, including making things like lab notes freely available online. You will perhaps know that there is today some concern among OA advocates at the way in which legacy publishers like Elsevier are acquiring more and more of the knowledge production infrastructure – including services that are essentially a product of the open access movement (e.g. Mendeley and SSRN) – as well as traditional pieces of the publishing infrastructure such as publication workflow solutions like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/corporate/elsevier-to-acquire-aries-systems-a-best-in-class-publication-workflow-solutions-provider&quot;&gt;Aries Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The concern is that in doing so legacy companies will be able to lock the research community into proprietary systems that will prove as expensive and controversial as the subscription &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep11/the-big-deal-not-price-but-cost.shtml&quot;&gt;Big Deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For instance, in 2016 Elsevier acquired a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=9,430,468.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/9,430,468&amp;amp;RS=PN/9,430,468&quot;&gt;peer review patent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and recently it acquired the manuscript submission and peer-review tracking system &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ariessys.com/software/editorial-manager/&quot;&gt;Editorial Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. EM is widely used by publishers, including OA publishers like PLOS. (Elsevier’s moves in this area have been documented in &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowledgegap.org/index.php/sub-projects/rent-seeking-and-financialization-of-the-academic-publishing-industry/preliminary-findings/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). In light of this, we are seeing calls for “open infrastructures”. As the authors of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put it, “Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures.” What is your take on this development, and what implications do you feel it might have for open science, particularly for those working in the global South?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I completely agree with the views expressed by Geoffrey Bilder, Jennifer Lin, and Cameron Neylon in ‘&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/&quot;&gt;Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructures’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What we are witnessing today is the capture of shared community resources by a handful of cash-rich conglomerates who want to monopolise every aspect of science communication. We as a community need to fight back against the monopolisation of our resources. As most researchers still appear to be unaware of the long-term consequences of such monopolisation, extensive campaigns are needed in order to create awareness among researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We should also fight this issue legally. Antitrust law might be a useful tool in this regard, as in my view many of the actions of legacy publishers like Elsevier violate antitrust law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, we should use the opposition procedures available under patent law to prevent frivolous patents like the peer review patent you highlighted being granted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The effect of unethical primes on cleansing preference – positive effect sizes denote greater cleansing preference for the unethical condition than the ethical condition.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps no concept has been more important to social psychology in recent years — for good and ill — than “social priming”, or the idea, as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2016/10/13/social-priming-works-after-all/%23.W-CodZNKhPb&quot;&gt;science writer Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; once put it, that “subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on human behaviour.” This subgenre of research has produced a steady drumbeat of interesting findings, but unfortunately, an increasing number of them are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;failing to replicate&lt;/a&gt; – including modern classics, like the idea that exposure to ageing-related words makes you walk more slowly, or that thinking about money increases your selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called “Macbeth effect” is another classic example of social priming that gained mainstream recognition and acceptance from psychologists and laypeople alike. The term was first introduced by the psychologists Chen-Bo Zhong and Katie Liljenquist, who reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Zhong%2520&amp;amp;%2520Liljenquist%25202006.pdf&quot;&gt;2006 paper in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;that “a threat to one’s moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim is such an interesting, provocative example of the connection between body and mind that it’s little wonder it has spread far and wide — there aren’t a lot of social-priming findings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth_effect&quot;&gt;their own Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; (it was also covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/09/15/your-conscience-really-can-be-wiped-clean/&quot;&gt;here at the Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;). But is it as strong as everyone thinks? For a recent paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1864-9335/a000349&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;in Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the psychologists Jedediah Siev, Shelby Zuckerman, and Joseph Siev decided to find out by conducting a meta-analysis of the available papers on the Macbeth effect to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35232&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their original research, Zhong and Liljenquist found that prompting people to think of a previous bad deed they’d committed led them to exhibit “an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea, then, is that someone who feels like they have committed an act of wrongdoing will be more likely, relative to a morally unsullied person, to want to wash their hands. Think Lady Macbeth in &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;, ravaged with guilt over the murder he husband has committed: &lt;i&gt;Out, damned spot!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siev and his colleagues collected all the relevant papers they could find, both published and unpublished (to help with the latter they used the website PsychFileDrawer.org and asked around among the research community). They only included direct replication attempts of Zhong and Liljenquist’s first three studies that “examined the effects of an immoral versus moral prime on cleansing-related preferences or behaviour,” not studies that examined the effect in the other direction, nor broader, so-called “conceptual replications” with somewhat different methodologies. This left them with “15 studies conducted with 1,746 participants from three different continents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a graphic from the paper laying out Siev and his colleagues’ results. The bold vertical line represents the point of zero effect size (no relationship between unethical primes and cleansing preferences), with larger effect sizes to the right.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s perhaps most noteworthy here is that whereas the effect sizes found in the original three “Macbeth effect” studies were moderate-to-large, in all the 11 independent replication attempts&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“there was no effect whatoseover”. In light of this, the authors argue, “the evidence suggests either that unethical primes do not generate a greater preference for cleansing-related stimuli than do ethical primes, or they generate a small one.” In other words it looks like the strength of the Macbeth Effect phenomenon has been overhyped, which won’t come as a surprise to those who have been following psychology’s replication crisis. (On the reverse question — of whether “cleansing alleviates moral threat” — the authors suggest there’s stronger evidence, in the form of several independent replications.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siev’s team dutifully point out that these failed replications shouldn’t be seen as the end of the story: A “Macbeth Effect may plausibly manifest within certain boundary conditions.” It could depend on the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; of moral threat a study participant is faced with, for example, or the type of cleaning involved (say, a floor versus one’s hands).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest lesson of this meta-analysis, though, has to do with science communications: It’s so often the case that when big, snazzy findings like the Macbeth Effect, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html&quot;&gt;power posing&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html&quot;&gt;implicit association test&lt;/a&gt; or any of a handful of other recent darlings of social psychology come down the pipeline, they’re quickly written up in university press releases and taken to be true by many consumers of popular science, as though they had been handed down on Biblical tablets. Yet subsequent attempts to replicate early, exciting effects have often either failed, or have uncovered something significantly less exciting. For everyone involved in this then — press officers, journalists and researchers themselves — just a bit more caution and humility is probably in order. In the meantime, it’s vital that researchers perform more replication attempts, and when practical, conduct these sorts of meta-analyses of replication attempts as well. It’s the only way to determine just how “real” snazzy ideas in psychology really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Look. You can’t plan out your life. What you have to do is first discover your passion—what you really care about&lt;/em&gt;.” Barack Obama, as quoted by David Gergen (cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;Jachimowicz et al, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Saturday Nov 17 in Newcastle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-newcastle-2018&quot;&gt;the first of two BPS careers events&lt;/a&gt; – “perfect for anyone looking to discover where psychology can take them in their chosen career.” A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;second follows in London&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 4. If, like many, you are searching for your calling in life – perhaps you are still unsure whether psychology is for you, or which area of the profession aligns with what you most care about – here are five digested research findings worth taking into consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35259&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a difference between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can find a career path or occupational goal that fires you up, you are more likely to succeed and find happiness through your work – that much we know from a deep research literature. But beware – since a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2003-08110-016&quot;&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 2003 by the Canadian psychologist Robert Vallerand and his colleagues, researchers have made an important distinction between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive one. If you feel that your passion or calling is out of control, and that your mood and self-esteem depend on it, then this is the obsessive variety, and such passions, while they are energising, are also associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;negative outcomes&lt;/a&gt; like burnout and anxiety. In contrast, if your passion feels in control, reflects qualities that you like about yourself, and complements other important activities in your life, then this is the harmonious version, which is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;positive outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, such as vitality, better work performance, experiencing flow, and positive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having an unanswered calling in life is worse than having no calling at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you already have a burning ambition or purpose, do not leave it to languish. A few years ago, researchers at the University of South Florida &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/07/follow-your-heart-having-an-unanswered-calling-in-life-is-worse-than-having-no-calling-at-all/&quot;&gt;surveyed hundreds of people&lt;/a&gt; and grouped them according to whether they felt like they had no calling in life, that they had a calling they’d answered, or they had a calling but had never done anything about it. In terms of their work engagement, career commitment, life satisfaction, health and stress, the stand-out finding was that the participants who had a calling they hadn’t answered scored the worst across all these measures. The researchers said this puts a different spin on the presumed benefits of having a calling in life. They concluded: “having a calling is only a benefit if it is met, but can be a detriment when it is not as compared to having no calling at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without passion, grit is “merely a grind”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All this talk of finding a passion, but you may also have heard that “grit” is vital for career success. As advanced most famously by psychologist Angela Duckworth, this is the idea that highly successful, gritty people have impressive persistence: “To be gritty,” Duckworth writes in her landmark book on the subject, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;is to fall down seven times, and rise eight&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s certainly true (many studies show) that being more conscientious – more self-disciplined and industrious – is associated with more career success. But is that all that being gritty means? Duckwork has always emphasised that it has another vital component that brings us back to passion again – alongside persistence, she says that gritty people also have an “ultimate concern” (another way of describing having a passion or calling). According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/9980&quot;&gt;a paper published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, however, the standard measure of grit has failed to assess passion (or more specifically, “passion attainment”) – and Jon Jachimowicz and his colleagues believe this could explain why the research on grit has been so inconsistent (leading to claims that it is an overhyped concept and simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/25/the-in-vogue-psychological-construct-grit-is-an-example-of-redundant-labelling-in-personality-psychology-claims-new-paper/&quot;&gt;conscientiousness repackaged&lt;/a&gt;). Jachimowicz’s team found that when they explicitly measured passion attainment (how much people feel they have adequate passion for their work) and combined this with a measure of perseverance (a consistency of interests and the ability to overcome setbacks), then the two together &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; predict superior performance among tech company employees and university students. “Our findings suggest that perseverance without passion attainment is mere drudgery, but perseverance with passion attainment propels individuals forward,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest enough effort and you may find that your work becomes your passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s all very well reading about the benefits of having a passion or calling in life, but if you haven’t got one, where to find it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;Duckwork says that it’s a mistake to think that in a moment of revelation one will land in your lap&lt;/a&gt;, or simply occur to you through quiet contemplation – rather you need to explore different activities and pursuits, and expose yourself the different challenges and needs confronting society. If you still draw a blank, then perhaps it’s worth heeding the advice of others who say that it is not always the case that energy and determination flow from finding your passion – sometimes it can be the other way around, and if you put enough energy into your work, then passion will follow. Consider, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/09/24/put-more-effort-into-a-project-and-youll-become-more-passionate-about-it/&quot;&gt;an eight-week repeated survey of German entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; published a few years ago that found a clear pattern – their passion for their ventures increased after they had invested more effort into the ventures the week before. A follow-up study qualified this, suggesting the energising effect of investing effort only arises when the project is freely chosen and there is a sense of progress. “Entrepreneurs increase their passion when they make significant progress in their venture and when they invest effort out of their own free choice,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think passion comes from doing a job you enjoy, you’re likely to be disappointed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another issue to consider is where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think passion comes from. In a paper released as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;preprint at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Jachimowicz and his team draw a distinction between people who believe that passion comes from doing what you enjoy (which they say is encapsulated by Oprah Winfrey’s commencement address in which she said passion “will bloom when we’re doing what we love”), and those who see it as arising from doing what you believe in or value in life (as reflected in the words of former Mexican President Felipe Calderón who in his own commencement address in 2011 said “you have to embrace with passion the things that you believe in, and that you are fighting for”). The researchers found that people believing that passion comes from pleasurable work were less likely to feel like they had found their passion (and were more likely to desire leaving their job) as compared with people who believe that passion comes from doing what you feel matters. Perhaps this is because there is a superficiality and ephemerality to working for sheer pleasure – what fits the bill one month or year may not do so for long – whereas working towards what you care about is a timeless endeavour that is likely to stretch and sustain you indefinitely. The researchers said their results showed: “the extent to which individuals attain their desired level of work passion may have less to do with their actual jobs and more to do with their beliefs about how work passion is pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe psychology might be your calling, the British Psychological Society is holding two careers events &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-newcastle-2018&quot;&gt;this weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;next month&lt;/a&gt;. Both are open to members (at a discount) and non-members.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Spike: Brains as Analog Computers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/fa297021f935</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/the-spike/brains-as-analog-computers-fa297021f935?source=rss----c92c31591e3a---4</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Brains might compute, but not digitally.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3tX8SxApeRHo7HwNBv19A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good question: Is the brain a computer? One thing that makes this a good question is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/how-to-find-out-if-your-brain-is-a-computer-644a1a4fed1b&quot;&gt;invites many further questions&lt;/a&gt;. Some people have taken the idea to be metaphorical: the brain is a computer in the same way that Juliet is the sun. That is just to say that it can be an illustrative way to think or talk about something, but not to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many do take it literally. My favorite example comes from the first sentence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/&quot;&gt;Christoph Koch&lt;/a&gt;’s book, &lt;em&gt;Biophysics of Computation&lt;/em&gt;: “Brains compute!’’ So what does it mean if we take this idea literally, too? What &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I’ll briefly look at some previous ideas about how brains might compute, then explore the role of analog computation for making sense of neural computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736&quot;&gt;explored in a previous blog post in this very forum&lt;/a&gt;, is that the brain is a computer because what it does can be described in terms of algorithms. Unfortunately, this view has some problems. One big one is that lots of things (maybe even everything) can be described algorithmically. If that’s true, then of course the brain is a computer, because everything is. But ideas that are trivially true aren’t very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not enough that something is merely &lt;em&gt;describable&lt;/em&gt; by an algorithm for it to be a computer. Perhaps we can say that the brain computes because it &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;runs&lt;/em&gt;, algorithms. Certainly not everything does that, even if everything is describable by an algorithm. Still, there is a problem with this idea. There’s a subtle, but important, distinction between being algorithmically describable and actually following an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example. Suppose I ask a child to write down a pattern of numbers, using the following rule. Start with 1, then add 3 to it and write that down, then add 5 to what you just wrote down, then add 7 to what you just wrote down, and so on. The child writes down 1, then 4, then 9, then 16, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the child is following an algorithm — the “add 3, then 5, then 7, etc.” rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we can describe what the child is doing in terms of another algorithm: the child is producing the squares of consecutive integers. There are two different algorithms that produce the same pattern (in fact, there are infinitely many such algorithms). In this example, we know which algorithm the child is following out of the many algorithms that describe the behavior. But in other cases, we might not know at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might not even make sense to think that the behavior of an organism is produced by following an algorithm at all, even if it is describable by some algorithm. For example, do single-celled organisms that move through increasing chemical gradients toward food really follow an algorithm? We know that computers can run algorithms depending on which program is running: these algorithms are stored and represented within the system. But for single-celled organisms, the “algorithm” is probably not represented anywhere: it’s just what the system does. But maybe it’s not a requirement that systems explicitly store and represent the algorithms they follow; however, that implies that objects falling due to gravity also follow algorithms! This does not seem like a happy result. These are all difficult and interesting questions, but for now, I will set them aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different problem with the idea of following algorithms is that what we usually mean by “algorithm” is entirely discrete. An algorithm consists of a finite series of discrete instructions, each of which takes some discrete amount of time. Turing’s work on the mathematical analysis of algorithms — and thus computation — assumes discrete time-steps and discrete variables (although, to be sure, “time’’ has to be understood abstractly as simply a succession of events, one after another, without particular units, such as milliseconds). Modern digital computers make the same assumptions. But we know that many elements of the brain are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; discrete: there are plenty of continuous quantities that seem to have an impact on what neurons do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s another problem. How we normally understand algorithms and computation is discrete through-and-through, but we know brains sometimes use continuous variables and processes. Even though we can &lt;em&gt;simulate&lt;/em&gt; continuous quantities digitally, that does not mean that continuous processes just &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other problems, but rather than going through them all, I think it’s better to look at a different way forward. But to get there, we have to take a moment to think carefully about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-010-9562-8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; really means, and what &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; mean&lt;/a&gt; — as well as how they can come apart. The upshot is that we can re-discover a way to think about computation that can be applied to computation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Representation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the brain as an analog computer makes a lot of sense, but first we have to be clear about what exactly that means. Some have entertained this idea, but under the mistaken idea that “analog” is just synonymous with “continuous.” One thought along these lines is that, because continuous quantities can be simulated digitally, analog computation is not worth taking seriously. However, there is much more to analog computation, and for those of us who want to understand how (or even if) brains compute, we should try to understand different types of computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to get a handle on analog representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of what “analog’’ means, they think it just means continuous. In fact, the terms “analog’’ and “continuous’’ are often used interchangeably (although sometimes people also use “analog’’ to mean not-digital, or not on a computer, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletjournal.com&quot;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/10/editorial-keep-shopping-week-analog&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;). However, a bit of reflection, plus a closer look at how analog computers actually operate, shows that this is not right. Instead, here’s the key idea:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analog representation is about &lt;em&gt;covariation&lt;/em&gt;, not continuity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some examples of simple analog devices. A mercury thermometer is a good one (although mercury has largely been replaced by alcohol). What makes this kind of thermometer analog, rather than digital? The way it works is simple: the thermometer represents temperature, and as the temperature increases, so does the level of liquid in the thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/1*0cvcV0i9pU-O67Ng0sdUKg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog thermometer.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is the second hand of an analog clock. The way it works is also simple: the hand represents time, and as time increases, so does the angle of the second hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/384/1*mDuUVaoQua9Qi99ZIuWZqA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog clock: as time increases, so do the angles of the hands.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both of these examples, the device represents something: temperature for the thermometer, and time for the watch. Also, in both of these examples, that representation is &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Simply put, because there is an analogy between the representation and what it represents. Specifically, as the thing that’s being represented increases, the physical property that’s &lt;em&gt;doing the representing&lt;/em&gt; also increases. And by increase, I mean a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; increase: an increase in the height of the liquid in the thermometer, and an increase in the angle of the second hand (with respect to 12, or straight up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But angles and heights are continuous, right? I just said that continuity is not what being analog is all about. But think about that analog clock again. Some electric clocks have second hands that sweep continuously, but many analog clocks (such as wristwatches) tick: the second hand moves in discrete steps. Does ticking (i.e. moving in discrete steps) mean an analog watch isn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; analog anymore? Of course not! An analog representation can be continuous &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; discrete, as long as the right kind of physical covariation is in place. When you start looking for them, you can see many more examples, too. Hourglasses, for example, are analog representations of how much time has passed, whether they contain a liquid, really small particles that you just take to be continuous, or big, discrete things like marbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this is all just a matter of thinking about the concept of “analog,” and looking at some examples of analog representation. But it also turns out that this is how to understand analog computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog (vs. Digital) Computation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t familiar with analog computation, you’re not alone. It was once the dominant computing paradigm, but digital computers have almost completely replaced analog computers. With advances in engineering, digital computers eventually became faster, more flexible, and cheaper than their analog counterparts. Nevertheless, they’re fascinating, and not just as a historical curiosity. They also exemplify a completely different kind of computation that — although not practical from an engineering perspective — shows another way that brains might compute. So let’s take a brief look at how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/949/1*qFmpB6hmsyw1ozo6hOH7kA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.analogmuseum.org/library/telefunken_ra770_kurzbeschreibung.pdf&quot;&gt;Engineer operating the Telefunken 770 RA analog computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key idea of analog computers is that they represent variables by the actual voltage level of a circuit element. So if you have a variable with the value 72.3, the circuit element representing that variable would be at 72.3 volts. This is completely different than how such a value would be stored in a digital computer: in that case, 72.3 would be represented by a series of 1s and 0s in some register (or, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754&quot;&gt;IEEE 754 standard for floating-point numbers,&lt;/a&gt; 01000010100100001001100110011010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add two variables in an analog computer, you use a circuit that literally adds the voltages: a circuit element would take two inputs, one that has &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; volts, one that has &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; volts, and produce an output that has (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) volts. But in a digital computer, to add two variables you use circuitry that adds the two numbers digit-by-digit, much the way that we all learned how to add numbers in elementary school. The least significant digits are added first, then the next most significant (plus a carry digit from the previous addition, if needed), and so on, until we reach the end of the digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the variables in analog computers are continuous, but there are exceptions, and those exceptions are important. Often, when using an analog computer, it helps to know how to program it using a mathematical characterization of whatever you’re interested in. But there are times when you might not know how to characterize something mathematically: you just know what it looks like. So instead of using a continuous function like a sine wave or polynomial, analog computers could approximate complex curves with a series of straight line segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*PK-qIF4ZrFQoGoCZyKi76Q.png&quot; /&gt;A continuous function (gray) approximated by a series of line segments (black).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other times, they would use step functions, with gaps between one value and another, where the voltage would literally switch between the values. Did the existence of these discontinuities mean that these computers weren’t really analog? Not at all: just like analog clocks that tick, analog computers with “steps” are still analog. And again, the reason is that there is analogy between &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they represent and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they represent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is worth belaboring a bit, especially in contrast with digital representation. Somewhat paradoxically, digital representation is both much more complicated but also much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take two digital representations of two different numbers. To keep things simple, we’ll use base-10, which we’re all familiar with, instead of the binary, or base-2 representation used in digital computers. The point is the same in either case. Compare how we represent the number three hundred forty seven and the number seven hundred twelve. Digitally, we represent the first number as 347, and the second as 712. What do those strings of numerals mean? Again, we are so familiar with this that we rarely stop to think about it, but we interpret them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;347&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 10²)+(4 ×10¹)+(7 × 10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 100)+(4 ×10)+(7 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 300 + 40 + 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;712&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 10²)+(1 ×10¹)+(2 ×10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 100)+(1 ×10)+(2 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 700 + 10 + 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important thing to note is that when we compare the two &lt;em&gt;representations&lt;/em&gt;, neither one is larger than the other. Of course, seven hundred twelve is a larger number than three hundred forty seven. But the three character string “712” is not itself larger than the three character string “347” (as long as we hold the font fixed!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are different when it comes to analog representations. If we represent these two numbers in an analog computer, for example, one voltage (712 volts) is literally larger than the other (347 volts). Or in the case of the analog thermometer, the height of the liquid representing 80 degrees is literally taller than the height representing 60 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, all of this still holds whether or not voltages and heights can only come in discrete pieces; analog representation just doesn’t have anything to do with continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing, let me mention another point about what digital does not mean. Some people take “digital” to be synonymous with “discrete,” but the two are different. Digital representations are, well, representations of digits, just like the example we just went through. “Discrete,” however, is much more general, and just means that the thing in question has separate parts. For many purposes, it may not be important that we’re careful about the distinction, but when we’re talking about computation, either in the brain or elsewhere, it is very important. Why? Simply because digital computers use the fact that numbers are represented digitally in order to function as they do. They are not called digital computers simply because they use discrete elements, or operate in discrete steps, but because they represent numbers (including variables, memory addresses, instructions, and so on) in base-2, digital format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, different kinds of tasks are better served by different kinds of computers using different kinds of representations. As it happened, digital computers got fast enough and cheap enough that they were preferred over their analog counterparts, although that wasn’t always true. But let’s look at just one simplified example to show the difference between a digital and an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*nIjx6j6bH5I1K3YiRespUw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I give you one thousand numbers that are represented digitally. More specifically, suppose I give you a thousand index cards, each one of which has a single number written on it. Your task is to find the largest number in that stack of a thousand. The fastest way to do this is also the simplest: you take the first card, call it the largest-so-far, then compare it with the next card. If that card is larger, you have a new largest-so-far; if not, you don’t. You keep comparing, and after 1,000 steps, you will have found the largest card in the pile. In general, how many steps does it take? It takes as many steps as cards you have. In computational complexity theory, we would say that this task has linear time complexity: start with 2,000 cards, it will take you twice as long; 3,000 cards, three times as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*rgaC7co6_DDq3s2iPSyXgw.png&quot; /&gt;Spaghetti noodles. © Can Stock Photo / AlfaStudio&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that instead of giving you a thousand numbers represented digitally, I gave you a thousand analog representations of numbers. In particular, suppose that I give you a bundle of one thousand spaghetti noodles, where the length of each noodle (in, say, millimeters) is the number being represented. Your task (again) is to find the largest number in those thousand. The fastest way to do this (again) is also the simplest: you take the bundle of noodles, tap one end on a flat surface, like a table, and place your hand down so that it hits the tallest one. After a single step, you will have found the largest noodle in the bundle, which represents the largest number of the thousand. In general, this only takes &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; step, which is constant time complexity (much better than linear!). No matter how many numbers (or, rather, representations of numbers) you start with, it’s always just one step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates one way that analog representation can be more efficient, but it also illustrates one of its limitations. Say we had many numbers that were very close in value to one another; it may be difficult to pick out the tallest one if they only differ by fractions of a millimeter. Represented digitally, however, we can easily tell whether two numbers are different. When it comes to contemporary digital computers, where individual steps can be taken at the rate of billions per second, this increased precision outweighs the larger number of steps needed (this, among others reasons, is why analog computers have fallen out of favor for general use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Computation in General…&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I hope to have made clear what analog representation is, and given at least a flavor of how analog computation works. Next, I need to say more about analog computation in general. Luckily for us though, understanding analog &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; is the hard part. All we need to add to the story to get analog computation is a mechanism that manipulates analog representations. But not just any old mechanism will do, nor will just any old manipulation. We need to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*ubrnz-_kfI0aFwLrRKEzyg.png&quot; /&gt;Schematic diagram of a mechanism: organized entities and their activities (bottom) are responsible for a phenomenon of interest (top).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophers of science have developed an account of mechanisms that makes precise what scientists, especially neuroscientists, implicitly mean when they talk about mechanisms (a book-length account is given in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.wustl.edu/cfcraver&quot;&gt;Carl Craver&lt;/a&gt;’s book Explaining the Brain). We don’t need to get into the details, but the general idea is straightforward: a mechanism is a set of entities and activities, organized in a particular way, that give rise to a phenomenon of interest. For much of neuroscience, what it means to explain some phenomenon is to discover and describe the mechanism responsible for that phenomenon. This is in contrast to, say, physics, where explanation involves describing a universal law of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we have a mechanism that manipulates analog representations, do we have an analog computer? Not quite. The manipulation has to be of the right kind. For example, I could build a device that rotates an analog thermometer (like the thermometer mentioned above). That’s certainly a kind of manipulation, and the device that does the rotating may well be a mechanism. But it’s not the right kind of manipulation. So what is the right kind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the mechanism has to manipulate the part of the analog representation that is doing the representing. So when we want to represent a temperature, we have to manipulate the &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt; of the liquid in the thermometer, not its angle. This, by the way, is precisely how thermostats work: one part of the device represents the actual temperature, another part of the device represents the desired temperature. And for analog thermostats, this is done with analog representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to see what this has to do with brains, let me point out that a nice thing about the story I just told is that it generalizes pretty well to digital computers, too. Just replace “analog” in what I said above with “digital:” a digital computer is a mechanism that manipulates digital representations, and it also has to manipulate them in the right way. Heating up the circuitry on your laptop is definitely a way to manipulate the digital representations inside, but not in a way that constitutes computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;…And in the Brain&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that we know what analog computation is, what does this have to do with brains? Quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a general point. Couching computation in terms of representation helps us distinguish what’s computational about the brain, and what isn’t. Brains, like all organs, do all kinds of things that aren’t directly relevant to their primary function, but simply help keep them alive. So for example, we once thought that glial cells only held neurons together and didn’t contribute anything interesting to neural signaling (hence their name, derived from the Greek word for glue). We now know that at least one type of glial cell, the astrocytes, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; contribute to signaling between neurons; another type, the ependymal cells, do not. That means that astrocytes — but not ependymal cells — contribute to computation in the brain. Neural signals are representations (or parts of representations), and the manipulation of those representations (by the right kind of mechanism) is computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s talk more specifically about what the &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; part of this story about computation has to do with brains. There is a whole lot of neural activity that counts as analog representation; you just have to remember that analog representation is about covariation (as discussed above), and not necessarily about continuity. So let’s look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/ratecoding&quot;&gt;consider rate coding&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most well-studied ideas of neural representation, and also one of the earliest. The basic idea of rate coding is simply that as a stimulus intensity increases (or decreases), the firing rate of the relevant neuron increases (or decreases). In other words, the representation (firing rate) increases with the thing being represented (the stimulus). That is about as straightforward an example of an analog representation as one could want. Whether it then counts as analog computation depends on whether the system in question manipulates that representation. For example, in their seminal 1926 work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1514868/&quot;&gt;Adrian and Zotterman&lt;/a&gt; found that as they increased the weight attached to muscle tissue, the sensory neurons of that muscle tissue increased their firing rate. The firing of those neurons serve as input to downstream neurons, and we have an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, rate coding has its limitations, but we can apply the model of analog computation to other neural coding schemes, too. For example, consider timing codes. Some timing codes in the auditory system, for example, work by comparing the relative time that different neural signals arrive at the same place. This allows the organism to locate where a sound came from. The larger the distance between the arrival of two signals, the larger the angle of the sound’s location from the center. Once again, an analog representation, used by the system, resulting in an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complicated example is how grid cells work. These are groups of neurons that create a two-dimensional map of a two-dimensional environment. So, for example, as the organism moves right, the activity of the grid cells “moves” right; as the organism moves left, the activity “moves” left. (More precisely, neurons representing locations to the left of the current position will fire as the organism moves left, vice versa for the right.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/375/1*2YtgtjV9pZMS_jE2wif0oA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Grid cells firing in response to an organism’s movement.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a two-dimensional analog representation, rather than the one-dimensional examples from above. Instead of changing just up or down, increasing or decreasing, we have change along two spatial dimensions. And the change in what’s represented (the environment) results in a corresponding change in the representation (the grid cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, higher-level, example is mental rotation in humans, which relies on the manipulation of analog representation (which, if you buy the view I propose here, just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; analog computation). Here is the task used in the relevant studies, originally devised by Shepard and Metzler in 1971. A participant is shown two pictures of 3-D objects, and asked to push one button (“same”) if the one on the right is a rotated version of the one on the left, and a different button (“different”) if the one on the right is a different object. An example is in the figure below: the top two figures are “same,” but the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*CCOh0tEHauufqba2nLkmoQ.png&quot; /&gt;Mental rotation stimuli. Top two objects are “same,” while the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when you record the time it takes for people to make a response (we only care about the “same” ones), you find that the more the objects are rotated, the longer it takes people to make that response. It’s as if people are mentally “rotating” the object in their head, and checking to see if the objects match. So, the more the objects are rotated, the more mental rotation they have to do, which translates into a longer response time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding has been replicated in numerous studies; in recent decades, cognitive neuroscientists have produced fMRI data from people performing the task while having their brain scanned. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17919082&quot;&gt;meta-analysis from 2008&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/&quot;&gt;Jeff Zacks&lt;/a&gt; found that dozens of these studies support the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations, supporting the original hypothesis proposed by Shepard and Metzler. Why should we think this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important point is that there are much more efficient ways to rotate the representation of an object. Using a typical digital representation, such as what is used in computer graphics systems, involves linear algebra. Without going into the details, the idea is that we can — in one step — multiply the 3-D coordinates of an object by a matrix, resulting in the object being rotated. Importantly, the amount of time it takes to rotate an object by two degrees is the same amount of time it takes to rotate an object by 180 degrees. However, that is simply not the result we find when humans perform this task. Instead, longer rotations take more time. That suggests that we are not rotating the object in a single step, but manipulating an analog representation that covaries with what it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analogy helps. Think about adding a couple of two-digit numbers the way you learned in elementary school. To keep things simple, we’ll use numbers that don’t require any carry digits. So if we want to add 11 to 12, we put one on top of the other, and add the digits. Same thing if we want to add 66 and 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/450/1*sF6FWsVFG-05n1AtUCy0Og.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, it takes the same number of steps, even though in the left problem, we’re starting and ending with much smaller numbers. This is just a fact about doing the addition digitally: even though the numbers are bigger, we’re just manipulating digits, and we’ve got the same number of digits in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s say we had to do the addition in a way that you learned when you were even younger, using (although you didn’t know it at the time) analog representations. Suppose we had a big bag of marbles, and we did the problem on the left by taking out 11 marbles, one at a time, then adding 12 marbles to those, one at a time, and then counting how many marbles we end up with. That would obviously take much less time than doing the problem on the right the same way. Now granted, this is not an efficient way of doing addition! But it does illustrate how analog — but not digital — representations take longer time to do some computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, some might think that this is all well and good, but at the very lowest levels, neural spikes are like the bits of digital computers; so maybe this analog stuff doesn’t have much to do with the hardware of the brain. Neural spikes are either on or off, just like the 1s and 0s of digital computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann&quot;&gt;John von Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the digital computer and a prolific polymath, put the view like this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181111/computer-and-brain&quot;&gt;his 1957 lecture&lt;/a&gt;: “The nervous pulses can clearly be viewed as (two-valued) markers: the absence of a pulse then represents one value (say, the binary digit 0), and the presence of one represents the other (say, the binary digit 1). This is clearly the description of the functioning of an organ in a digital machine. It therefore justifies the original assertion, that the nervous system has a prima facie digital character.” So maybe there are some analog things happening at higher levels, but at its root, neural spikes are discrete and digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some new evidence suggests that this might not be the whole story. An intriguing set of examples from scientists including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394682&quot;&gt;Bialowas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461842&quot;&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228266&quot;&gt;Rowan&lt;/a&gt;, and several others shows that there may be more to action potentials than previously thought. So first, let’s review a bit about action potentials, then see what these new results suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional view of the action potential is that it is a lot like the binary pulse of a digital computer. If we look close at the 1s and 0s of a digital computer, we’ll see that they are actually continuously-changing voltages. However, that continuous change stays around either (for example) zero volts or five volts, and the minor fluctuations above and below those two levels don’t matter for digital systems. That’s because we have designed them that way: even though there is continuous fluctuation, we can treat those voltages as if they are really at two discrete levels, which we call 0 and 1. The slight difference in the waveform from one bit to another doesn’t matter: all that matters is that there is some voltage that’s pretty close to 5 volts or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*XTIKoPJdiGAqiXF45gWiww.png&quot; /&gt;The digital computer and the neuron. Top: actual transistor voltage is “translated” as a 1. Bottom: actual neuron voltage is “translated” as a 1.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how neuroscientists have traditionally viewed the action potential, too. If we compare two different action potentials, there might be a slight difference in the waveform, but that doesn’t matter for the system. All that matters is whether there’s an action potential or not. Now, to be sure, there are exceptions: some neurons don’t generate spikes at all, but have a signal that varies continuously — neurons connected by gap junctions are an important example. And for other neurons, it’s not really the single spike that matters, but their rate of firing, as mentioned above. But these new findings are different altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having no significance, the scientists mentioned above have shown that the precise shape of the neural spike does have consequences. What does that mean? Basically, if a neural spike is a bit taller (it has a higher voltage), then it has a measurable effect on what happens to the neurons it’s connected to. Or, if the spike is a bit wider (it takes a little bit longer), then it also has a measurable effect on downstream neurons. These effects are small, but they are measurable, and completely different than what we find in digital computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So do these count as analog representations? Well, we don’t know yet. They are candidates, because we have something (a neural spike) that varies in the right way. But we do not yet know if these are representations at all. As mentioned before, neurons can do a lot of things, not all of which contribute to their representational capacities. If it turns out that the height (or width) of the neural spike increases as some other variable increases, it may well be a representation. We will have to see. For now though, it is an interesting candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me mention one aspect of analog computation that really has no counterpart in digital computation, which is also, admittedly, the most speculative on my part. Imagine you have a small computer program, or perhaps even a spreadsheet, where you have some variable called, say, “GrandTotal.” It’s easy enough to program a computer (or create a spreadsheet) that adds a whole bunch of numbers together, and stores that result in GrandTotal. And somewhere, deep in the electronic bowels of your computer’s processor, there are some circuits called registers, and there’s a single register that physically stores the value of GrantTotal. Your computer is doing a lot of other things, so there are a lot of other values stored in nearby registers, too. Suppose, in fact, that, just for fun, you wanted to add the values of the eight nearest neighbors — the other registers nearest to GrandTotal — and store those in GrandTotal, too. How can you do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t. The way digital machines are designed and built, their physical implementation is completely abstracted from their programming. There is no way to access variables that are literally, physically closest to the one you are working with. Of course, if you are very familiar with a particular computer, you might be able to discover which of those registers are closest. But then they will be completely different in another machine. There is simply no way to put this kind of capability into the general programming of a digital computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, however, neurons do things like this all the time. Some neural signals, such as neuromodulators, are often simply broadcast to whatever neurons happen to be nearby. This capability takes advantage of the fact that neurons are physical devices, located in space relative to one another. And although digital computation can’t provide this kind of capability, certain kinds of analog computation can. This is simply because &lt;em&gt;analog computation embraces the physical nature of its representations, whereas digital computation abstracts away from it&lt;/em&gt;. Now to be sure, digital computation has many advantages: it is quite nice to be able to use the same program on a wide variety of different computers from different manufacturers, with different speeds, different amounts of memory, and so on. But there is more to computation than just the digital, which, if I’ve done my job, you’ll believe now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analog computers have fallen out of favor, and as a consequence, we don’t think about them when we think about computation. And while the advantages of digital computation are clear for practical purposes, analog computation turns out to be an excellent way to think of computation more generally. When we look closely at how digital computation really works, it has almost nothing in common with how brains work. If digital computation is the only concept of computation you have, you might think we should abandon the idea that brains literally compute. But that would be much too hasty: we just need a broader notion of computation, and it turns out that looking to analog computation helps us see how brains could be computers after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;Every child is born into a world far more complex than the womb it departed. Physically it’s made up of objects, distances, heights, which we know new-born infants are already oriented to read and make sense of. But their new world is also a social one, chock-full of agents with needs and intentions, and past findings show that infants are surprisingly quick to recognise much of this too.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;New research &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds to this literature, investigating the ability to make an important social distinction – between those who hold power due to respect and those who impose it through force – and finds that already by the time they are toddlers, infants can do this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35161&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past evidence showed that infants in the first year of life can view situations and recognise who is likely to hold power. They are more surprised (we know this because they pay attention for longer) when a smaller figure bosses a bigger one about, or a lone figure controls someone with companions, than when the opposite is true. Infants also seem to grasp that power lasts over time, looking longer when someone who used to be obeyed is suddenly defied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Francesco Margoni of the University of Trento, wanted to see if this sensitivity to power extended to telling between its two major types –  legitimate power (e.g. when someone is chosen to be leader or has natural talents) and power based on bullying and inciting fear. We know that these types of power have different implications: fear-based power is resented and can lead to acts of disobedience when possible. Do infants have a sense of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Margoni’s team recruited 96 healthy infants – average age 20-24 months; a balance of sexes – and presented them with a series of cartoony videos (see examples below). One set began with three figures playing with a ball who are visited by a leader wearing a flamboyant hat and wielding a stick that it used to strike the floor, triggering a greeting ritual involving the ball-players&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bowing and murmuring reverently (intended to show this leader was respected).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the leader told the other characters it was time for bed, led them into a house, and left. At this point the study forked, and the infants either saw the subordinates closing their eyes, thus obeying the leader, or they watched a different clip where the ball-playing characters exited the house back to their game area. These two 15-second climaxes looped until the infant lost interest. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the infants looked significantly longer at the version of the story involving disobedience, suggesting that already at this age, the infants did not expect a respected leader to be disobeyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other infants viewed a similar series of videos with a crucial difference: the cue for where the visiting leader was drawing their power. Instead of using their stick for a greeting ritual, this bully visitor used it to strike each of the other characters on the head. Margoni’s team were interested in what the infants would make of disobedience towards this kind of bullying leader. In fact the infants’ looking times were similar whether the subordinate characters did as they were told or disobeyed, suggesting they did not find disobeying a bully at all surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow-up experiments showed the main findings were unaffected by whether or not the leader wore a giant hat (implying that the size of the leader figure wasn’t the determining factor). Nor were the effects due to the bully being seen as ineffectual: when another video showed the bully staying in the room, infants now found disobedience surprising. Even though the bully was outnumbered, the infants still expected what the bully said to be law… at least for those within reach of the stick.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last possibility was that the infants expected compliance to the leader figure because they seemed nice, not because they seemed powerful. So the researchers introduced a visitor who was friendly but had no obvious power. Now the infants were more surprised when the ball-playing characters &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; obey, quite the opposite effect to that found with the respected leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that we understand power relations at a surprisingly young age. The infant mind can read legitimate power and distinguish it from tyranny, understanding not merely who is in charge, but why. Even toddlers recognise that the iron fist holds the most tenuous grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;Infants distinguish between leaders and bullies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinoud Maex's journal club session on his review: &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-integrative-neuroscience/jin008&quot;&gt;On the Nernst-Planck equation (Reinoud Maex, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to know why the electro-diffusion equation is called the Nernst-Planck equation, I read the original papers by these authors a few years ago. This reading formed the basis of a little review paper of mine with the above title (published in Journal of Integrative Neuroscience 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review first discussed Nernst's and Planck's early papers on electro-diffusion, the brief priority conflict that followed, and the role these papers played in shaping the  emerging concept of membrane excitability. The second part of this review discussed in greater detail the constraints of the Nernst-Planck theory, and showed more recent examples of its applicability to neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>For Better Science: Did Frontiers help Robert-Jan Smits design Plan S?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://forbetterscience.com/?p=33017</guid>
	<link>https://forbetterscience.com/2018/11/13/did-frontiers-help-robert-jan-smits-design-plan-s/</link>
	<description>I obtained from the EU commission evidence that Smits was at least strongly influenced by Frontiers while designing Plan S. There were meetings with Kamila Markram and other Frontiers representatives, most notably on 25 April 2018, and a string of emails, where Smits requested and received &quot;Frontiers feedback on the transition to OA and APCs&quot;. Smits recently accepted the invitation as speaker next to Kamila, at a Frontiers-organised conference on 29 November 2018 in Brussels.</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People are “consistently inconsistent” in how they reason about controversial scientific topics</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are various issues on which there is a scientific consensus but great public controversy, such as anthropogenic climate change and the safety of vaccines. One previously popular explanation for this mismatch was that an information deficit among the public is to blame. Give people all the facts and then, according to this perspective, the public will catch up with the scientists. Yet time and again, that simply hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2018.1521870&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Thinking and Reasoning&lt;/em&gt; explores the roots of this problem further. Emilio Lobato and Corinne Zimmerman asked 244 American university students and staff whether they agreed with the scientific consensus on climate change, vaccines, genetically modified (GMO) foods and evolution; to give their reasons; and to say what would convince them to change their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has already done a good job of identifying the individual characteristics – such as having an analytical thinking style and being non-religious – that tend to correlate with accepting the scientific consensus, but this is the first time that researchers have systematically studied people’s open-ended reasoning about controversial scientific topics. The results show that for many people, there are certain issues for which the truth is less about facts and more about faith and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35193&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman found that the most common justifications people gave for their positions on the controversial issues were to simply re-state or qualify their belief – what the researchers called a non-justification, which made up 34 per cent of all responses. Among the actual justifications, the most common kind, making up 33 per cent of all responses, was to cite evidence – a promising result. However, 20 per cent of justifications were subjective and involved making a reference to one’s cultural identity, personal experience or fallacious reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific kinds of subjective justification given tended to vary according to topic. For instance, sceptical attitudes toward the scientific consensus on genetically modified foods (as safe) tended to involve fallacious reasoning of a conspiratorial bent (such as “I am hesitant to believe there are NO concerns because the multinational agricultural corporations such as Monsanto have profits as the basis of their existence so any information they put out is suspect”), or they invoked the naturalistic fallacy (such as, “GMO foods are unnatural and therefore not safe for our bodies”). In contrast, subjective justifications for disbelieving evolutionary theory were more likely to make reference to the importance of one’s cultural or religious identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most significant finding, though, was people’s inconsistency in how they reasoned about the four different scientific topics. For example, while many participants did cite data and evidence to justify their stance on some occasions, only 27 participants (11 per cent) did this consistently across all the topics. “It seems that people are consistently inconsistent in how they reason about scientific topics,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a similar story when it came to the kind of reasons that participants cited that would cause them to change their minds. While it was promising that new evidence or data was mentioned more often than any other reasons, still 45 per cent of participants explicitly denied, at least once, that anything could change their mind on a particular topic; 17 per cent said this of more than one topic. And while 80 per cent of participants indicated that new evidence or data would change their mind on a particular topic, not a single participant took this position on all four controversial topics. Again, the main message is people’s inconsistency in how they reason about different scientific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming prior research on individual characteristics that correlate with scientific reasoning, participants with more of an analytical reasoning style (as measured by agreement with questionnaire items like “I enjoy problems that require hard thinking”) and a stronger liberal political orientation, were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus on the four topics, and to make reference to evidence when reasoning about their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman cautioned that it remains to be seen whether their findings would generalise to scientific topics that have not (yet) been politicised. Of course the current results are also based on a narrow US sample and may be different elsewhere. Notwithstanding these limitations, the researchers said their findings could have implications for scientific advocates: they suggest it may be beneficial to discuss and present topics in a way that reduces any association with your audience’s socio-political identity; and they highlight the importance of better training and education in an analytical thinking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to tailor education about science to the manner in which people think about science may improve scientific literacy,” the researchers concluded, “but doing so requires more research into why people hold the beliefs they do about science.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Highlights of the BMC Series: October 2018</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/12/highlights-bmc-series-october-2018/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-018-0462-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect of pulsed transcranial ultrasound stimulation at different number of tone-burst on cortico-muscular coupling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation can be defined as “the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body.” A growing area of research in the field of neuromodulation has been centered around its potential effects on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Successful neuromodulation of the motor cortex could promise life-changing implications for those affected by movement disorders brought on by stroke and diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising neuromodulation technique shown to affect the motor cortex is pulse transcranial ultrasound stimulation (pTUS). This method uses pulsed low-frequency ultrasound to harmlessly penetrate deep into brain tissue and can be targeted specifically towards brain waves which affect muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers published a study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which looked at the effect pTUS had on the cortico-muscular coupling (mind-muscle connection) between the motor cortex and tail muscles in mouse subjects. Researchers, Xie &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; tested different tone bursts and evaluated the effect they had on the muscle activity of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xie and colleagues found that significant differences in the cortico-muscular coupling activity of mice resulted from an increasing number of tone-bursts, from 150 – 300, at 1kHZ. The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1300-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Procedural pain in children: a qualitative study of caregiver experiences and information needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric medical patients are often not as resilient to the pain associated with common invasive medical procedures, such as venipuncture, when compared to their adult counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Shave &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, published this study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they took a qualitative, interview-based approach at assessing child caregivers’ understanding and perspective towards pain associated with pediatric medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10642&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10642&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/paed-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey saw that caregivers were generally satisfied with the pain management practices that healthcare providers afforded their pediatric patients. However, study participants showed further emphasis toward the value of providing extra information to caregivers and pediatric patients, regarding the purpose of the procedures, as well as what to expect in terms of pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Lastly, participating caregivers further suggested that healthcare providers should direct extra effort towards addressing the child specifically, informing them of the sensations and outcomes of the procedure in terms they can understand; as well as allowing the pediatric patients to ask questions and make decisions regarding the procedure whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmecheng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BMC Series’ newest journal for the physical sciences, Mechanical Engineering, is now open to submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the BMC Series announced that it would be expanding its journal portfolio beyond the realm of biology and medicine, and into the physical sciences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmecheng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is the fourth and latest of these journals to be open for submission. The journal’s scope ranges from articles on “fluid dynamics” to “mechatronics and automation” and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandros Houssein, Ph.D., Editor for &lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2018/10/26/bmc-mechanical-engineering-now-open-submissions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; announcing the journal’s launch and detailing the importance of the new open access platform now available to the mechanical engineering research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Houssein speaks on behalf of the journal’s ethos by stating, “&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; embraces this diversity of subjects and comes to support a large and international research community. With a focus on championing open access research, it aims to advance scientific discovery by making research freely accessible across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-018-0476-4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A highly parallel strategy for storage of digital information in living cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10646&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10646 size-large&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/dna-1024x512.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of digital information in DNA has recently gained a lot of attention due to its promise of high-volume, and extremely long-term, storage potential. While DNA digital data storage is currently possible and being utilized, improvements to methodologies are necessary to realize the full potential of this fascinating and efficient storage model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Akhmetov &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, have recently published an article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they detail their development of a novel DNA digital data storage method. Their “parallelized” storage method aims to capitalize on the weaknesses of previously established methodologies, allowing for better long-term storage, built-in error detection, increased efficiency, and a redundant reading process that allows for the collection of data even if the DNA is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of better DNA digital storage methodologies will be fascinating developments to witness as we make it feasible to store immense datasets for longer terms than previously thought possible, all using the building blocks of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aiche.org/chenected/2018/10/sang-yup-lee-on-importance-publishing-scientific-journals-interview&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIChE Annual Meeting 2018: An interview with the chair of BMC Chemical Engineering on the importance of publishing, and benefits of open access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just prior to the 2018 annual meeting for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the chair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Sang Yup Lee, participated in an interview where the importance of scientific publishing was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee began by discussing how, over the years, the field of Chemical Engineering has been constantly adapting its principles and practices to remain useful, and in some cases essential, to various scientific disciplines. Dr. Lee even asserted, “Chemical engineering has been, is and will be at the core of all industries, including energy, chemicals, materials, medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this information being generated by chemical engineers across such a wide field of disciplines, Dr. Lee went on to emphasize the importance of publication and the open access model: “Publishing in scientific journals is one of the most important media for the dissemination of research outputs. Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5995-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating the growing trend of non-drinking among young people; analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys in England 2005–2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England’s youth have been experiencing an increasing trend in alcohol abstention, which has been wholly celebrated from a public health standpoint. Among citizens aged 16 to 24, the rate of self-reported “non-drinkers” has risen from 18% in 2005 to 29% in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10645&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10645&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/non-drinking-300x300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed to look at the ways in which non-drinking behavior has been increasing among the young adult population in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study evaluated whether specific subgroups have been experiencing a disproportionate increase in non-drinking, as well as whether rates of problematic drinking behaviors, such as binge drinking, are changing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers Fat &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, utilized a qualitative, survey-based approach, where trained interviewers administered a face-to-face interview inside participants’ homes. The study revealed that rates of non-drinking are on the rise across most of its practices, the only exception being that of ex-drinkers, which saw neither an increase or decrease in prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study also showed that, overall, non-drinking behavior is increasing across many subgroups, including subgroups that are already associated with non-drinking behavior. Young adults are also engaging in problematic drinking behaviors less, as rates of overdrinking and binge drinking are lower than previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found no significant association between non-drinking and any one single factor in particular, suggesting that the change may be “multi-factorial or cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12904-018-0368-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Access to palliative care for homeless people: complex lives, complex care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless individuals lack many things considered essential, appropriate health care should not be one of them. In the year 2000, the United Nations stated: “Health is a fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights. Every human being is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity.” Despite this policy, it has been shown that the homeless population is still not afforded an appropriate level of care, especially for end of life palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10654&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10654 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/homeless-2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors of an article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detail their findings from their study on the quality of palliative care provided to the homeless population in the Netherlands. De Veer &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; conducted quality in-depth interviews with over 50 participants, including homeless individuals, nurses, case workers, and physicians. The interviews were used to reconstruct the cases of 19 homeless individuals who are or have previously experienced palliative care, 11 of which had already passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the non-homeless population, homeless individuals were found to experience several key themes that prevented them from experiencing adequate palliative care, namely: late access to palliative care, capricious health care trajectories, and a high degree of complexity associated with care.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open and Shut?: Plan S and Researchers’ Rights: (Re)Framing Academic Freedom</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;When in 1915 the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was formed, and published its &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/A6520A9D-0A9A-47B3-B550-C006B5B224E7/0/1915Declaration.pdf&quot;&gt;Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it was responding to a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_University_Professors#History&quot;&gt;specific historical situation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today the historical situation researchers find themselves in is different and academic freedom faces &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ceupress.com/book/academic-freedom&quot;&gt;new challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. What complicates the picture is that there is considerable disagreement over what exactly academic freedom is, and what aspects of academic life it covers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;This lack of consensus has become all too apparent in the current discussions about Plan S. Indeed, some of those who support Plan S maintain that academic freedom is no longer relevant, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonHoyt/status/1059784394116947968&quot;&gt;or has ceased to exist in any meaningful way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot;&gt;key principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Plan S – which a growing number of funders are signing up to – is that “After 1 January 2020 scientific publications on the results from research funded by public grants provided by national and European research councils and funding bodies, must be published in compliant Open Access Journals or on compliant Open Access Platforms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most (if not all) researchers would surely agree that this is a laudable goal. But for some (we don’t know how many) the way in which it is currently envisaged that Plan S will be implemented raises a red flag with regard to academic freedom. It does not help that those who devised the initiative dismiss these concerns out of hand. The main architect of Plan S –  Robert-Jan Smits – &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06936-7&quot;&gt;has even bemoaned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the fact that people are citing academic freedom in the context of Plan S, “because it stifles a lot of debate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, it is clear that some researchers believe Plan S does have implications for academic freedom. And a growing number of them (currently approaching 1,000) are signing &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/open-letter&quot;&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that asserts, amongst other things, that Plan S “is a serious violation of academic freedom”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the apparent disenchantment with Plan S amongst at least some in the research community, and given that researchers find themselves increasingly subjected to ever more demanding OA policies like it (in which new duties, new restrictions and limitations, and new responsibilities are imposed on them), it is surely time to look again at what academic freedom does and does not mean, and what it should and should not mean in today’s context, and try to redefine and/or refine it for today’s historical situation; or at least to, as Marc Couture puts it in his guest post below, seek to “reframe” it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What seems clear to me is that there is a pressing need for a debate about the relevance, role and responsibilities of academic freedom in the context of the growing list of open access policies, with a view to arriving at some kind of consensus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What also seems clear to me is that this discussion ought to take place amongst researchers before funders seek to impose radical initiatives like Plan S on them. After all, if academic freedom means anything, it surely means that it is researchers and their institutions who should be in the driving seat over this, not funders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;But why not read what Marc Couture has to say below and think about the questions he asks before reaching your own conclusion on these matters. It may well be that Marc’s views on whether and how Plan S has implications for academic freedom are different to mine. But I am not a member of the research community, so my views are not what counts here. What I think &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; count is what the majority of researchers think. And without a meaningful debate, we will never know that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Plan S and Researchers’ Rights: (Re)Framing Academic Freedom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Marc Couture&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Oacf2_KQYKY/W-mdCfbvcII/AAAAAAAAh1g/M5wVOMmiXJQkftMoPBoDpJud9VBwlLAkgCLcBGAs/s1600/MC_2018-11-08-01.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Oacf2_KQYKY/W-mdCfbvcII/AAAAAAAAh1g/M5wVOMmiXJQkftMoPBoDpJud9VBwlLAkgCLcBGAs/s200/MC_2018-11-08-01.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The announcement of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; has generated many much needed (and much heated) discussions. I’m pleased to observe that these don’t concern the relevance of open access, whose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://works.bepress.com/jean_gabriel_bankier/27/&quot;&gt;wide-ranging benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; now seem to be almost universally acknowledged, but only potentially negative side-effects of the massive, if not global, shift to open access that the plan hopes to bring about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though many aspects of the plan are somewhat unclear, and most details of its implementation are still being drafted, what we do know already raises various worries. One is a possible conflict with academic freedom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two requirements of the plan are specifically targeted: (1) publication only in compliant journals (full OA, no hybrid) and (2) dissemination under a licence compliant with the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration&quot;&gt;Berlin OA definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which would require authors to accept ceding generous usage rights in their works to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must say first that I firmly believe that academic freedom is important; it is at the very heart of higher education. Drawing from the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyacademicfreedom.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;numerous available definitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I would formulate its basic, most general definition as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 35.4pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n11&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 35.4pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Academic freedom (AF) is the right, for individual academics as well as their institutions, to decide by themselves the subjects and ideas they wish to investigate, disseminate or teach upon without fear of reprisal or censorship, with the ultimate purpose of benefitting both scholarship and the common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n11&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some definitions of AF include further rights, for instance the right – individually or as a community – to decide not only what is investigated, disseminated or taught, but how it is done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others add more specific freedoms, the most relevant in relation to Plan S being the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001132/113234mb.pdf&quot;&gt;freedom to choose the publication venue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for one’s research results. One also remarks that the language used in some definitions can be very strong, qualifying such freedoms as “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure&quot;&gt;full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdenver.edu/policy/Pages/Academic-Freedom.aspx&quot;&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” or “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmu.edu/resources/facstaff/senate/EXC_MINUTES_8-17-18.pdf&quot;&gt;without constraints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;A &lt;i&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It must be pointed out that AF is neither an absolute, divine-like right, nor a “blank check” granted to researchers. It’s rather a privilege, bestowed to academia by society. Moreover, a &lt;i&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/i&gt; is at work here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the one hand, society acknowledges that scholarship is the most powerful and trustworthy way to explain the world and solve its problems, as long as it is protected from ideological, political and economic vested interests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other hand, scholars, both individually and collectively, must act in a responsible way, by living up to the values underpinning scholarship (rationality, critical thinking, honesty and respect in debates) and the common good (equity, inclusivity, human dignity).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far, the discussions on actual or potential conflicts between Plan S and AF have involved specific freedoms found in one or another definition, with participants arguing that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(1) This or that requirement of Plan S does (or doesn’t) concern, or conflict with, AF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2) This or that measure proposed in Plan S may concern or conflict with AF, but other things as problematic, if not more, have been going on for years in academia without anybody complaining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(3) (Generally, in response to #1 or #2) this or that definition of AF is unclear, outdated or irrelevant, and must be dismissed, or interpreted in this or that way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;My stance is that while more freedom is &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; preferable in the academy, the exercise of rights included in AF, especially the more specific ones found in its various definitions, may or may not contribute, in a given situation or context, to AF’s ultimate purpose of benefitting scholarship and/or the common good. In fact, it could even do the exact opposite, or entail both benefits and harms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, when a measure or a policy seems to conflict with those rights, one should not simply brandish AF as a “trump card” as an argument to counter it, but see this conflict as a warning, inviting one to examine to what extent the exercise of AF, in the situation at hand, effectively benefits – or hinders – scholarship and the common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me illustrate this approach by looking at the two issues I mentioned in relation to Plan S where the topic of AF has been brought forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;(1) Constraints on publishing venues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S puts severe constraints on the venues where research results may be published. This will reduce the choices available to researchers. However, to what extent it will do so is currently hard to assess, as it depends on publishers’ response to Plan S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, any conflict with AF would be of utmost concern, since the right to disseminate one’s results is viewed as part of the basic definition of AF. One such conflict I could foresee in this context is if, when Plan S is finally implemented, researchers choosing marginal or unpopular, yet legitimate, topics or methods found they were unable to publish their results in peer-reviewed scholarly journals altogether, because not one, or too few of those complying with Plan S would consider, let alone accept, their papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, I haven’t seen any mention of such a dire scenario in the discussions about Plan S; considering the ever-increasing number of OA journals in all fields, this is understandable. Rather, the major complaint is that Plan S will impede researchers from publishing in very specific journals, meaning highly selective, high impact ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is viewed as conflicting with AF, on the grounds that definitions of AF either imply researchers must be the only ones to have a say in the way research is done (this may or may not include publication), or with reference to more specific freedoms, like “full freedom in publication” or the right to choose the publishing venue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is thus not surprising that critics have invoked specific rights associated to AF to oppose measures that could either (1) hurt leading, generally (for the time being) non-compliant journals or (2) impede researchers from publishing in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, researchers wouldn’t lose the possibility of disseminating their results. Most papers submitted to these highly selective journals are rejected not for being faulty, but because they are deemed unimportant, not original enough, or unfit for the venue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-017-9921-3&quot;&gt;most of them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are subsequently published in other journals, often journals that focus less on criteria like relevance and potential impact and more on the general quality of the paper and the soundness of reasoning and analysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What those researchers who succeed in having their papers published in prestigious journals really fear is losing the ability to benefit, career-wise, from the so-called “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fennia.journal.fi/article/view/70469/32624&quot;&gt;prestige economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, where journals are evaluated and ranked according to qualitative (perceived prestige) and, increasingly, quantitative criteria (rejection rates, impact factors), and where individual researchers are judged by their peers in large part on the number of papers and the journals in which the papers appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there are strong reasons to believe, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037&quot;&gt;mounting evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to that effect, that this prestige-based evaluation system, as deeply ingrained in academia as it may be, is deeply flawed on many accounts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, the “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;publishing oligopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” of large publishers has skillfully used it to increase its stranglehold on scholarly publication and to justify its skyrocketing costs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One can even argue that the current system conflicts with the freedom of choice in research included in AF’s basic definition. After all, giving prominence to the number of papers and restricting journals that really “count” towards evaluation to leading, high impact ones may in practice make researchers, if they hope to remain in academia, avoid research topics or methods that take too much time to produce results, or that won’t be considered by these highly selective journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here we face a peculiar situation where, in the very name of AF, the research community hesitates to let go of, or significantly reform, a system that is far from optimal and that, quite paradoxically, may well limit the AF of individual researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cOAlitionS_Preamble.pdf&quot;&gt;Preamble of Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; alludes to this prestige economy, by speaking of a “misdirected reward system” and by endorsing the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA Declaration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which proposes that researchers are judged upon the quality and impact of their research, both multi-faceted notions not reducible to numbers and journal names. And while its principles don’t refer explicitly to this system, Plan S has certainly the potential to disturb, or even disrupt it, again to an extent difficult to assess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, one has to put into balance two consequences of the drastic change Plan S hopes to achieve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the one side, there could be drawbacks for some researchers, though one can think that under a new evaluation paradigm, many if not most of them would still see their valuable work recognized. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The importance of high-impact journals, possibly imperilled by Plan S, for assessing the quality of scholarship has also been highlighted, although studies (like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418218112&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) draw a more nuanced picture of the efficiency of the gatekeeping they provide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other side, there are potential benefits to scholarship, in terms of efficiency (e.g., the overall burden of peer-review being reduced, publication delays shortened), and to society (e.g. fewer public funds diverted towards publishers’ revenues and profits, universal access to research results).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;(2) The requirement to publish with a liberal licence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S also requires that the main research results are disseminated under a licence with minimal restrictions (CC BY or similar). Since deciding the way in which one’s works are used may be part of “full freedom in publication”, this requirement may also be viewed as conflicting with AF. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, some researchers don’t like to see their works used by others to “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://schadtlab.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/a-rant-on-strawberries-open-access-licenses-and-the-reuse-of-published-papers/&quot;&gt;make money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”; many are also reluctant to let others adapt them, fearing that this may endanger both the quality of scholarship and the author’s own reputation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, we might wonder to what extent allowing researchers to decide how their works are used (this includes, ironically, letting publishers become the ones to decide) is beneficial to scholarship and society. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What contributes more to AF’s ultimate purpose: protecting works against uses researchers dislike or fear, or allowing those works to be easily used and adapted? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are numerous studies and discussions on this topic, covering issues like fear &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; actual risk, the fuzziness of the various usage restrictions, and their effects on potential users, that could feed the discussion (see for instance &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.107&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.150.2189&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openglam.org/files/2013/01/iRights_CC-NC_Guide_English.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, what I propose here is to reframe the role that academic freedom plays in discussions about the proposals put forth in Plan S, by assessing both their potential consequences on scholarship and the common good as well as the nature of their actual or potential conflict with AF, keeping in mind that the &lt;i&gt;raison d’être&lt;/i&gt; of AF is, after all, to benefit scholarship and the common good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this leaves much room for interpretation and discussion, notably how we define quality in scholarship and what constitutes the common good, I believe it would help answer questions like: Is Plan S a sound, or reasonable proposal? How can it be improved and implemented in order to reach its stated goal, that is flipping to OA a sizable part of scholarly communication, while bringing benefits to both scholarship and society? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are crucial issues, and I see a real danger that a strict, almost dogmatic stance on AF could cause Plan S to fall short of its potential to pave the way towards a less costly, yet &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fairopenaccess.org/&quot;&gt;more fair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, full-OA scholarly publication system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The author thanks Marie-Josée Legault and Richard Poynder for their helpful comments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;n00&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teluq.ca/~mcouture/home.htm&quot;&gt;Marc Couture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; was until recently science professor at &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teluq.ca/site/en&quot;&gt;TELUQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, University of Quebec distance education arm.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schadenfreude – which literally means “harm-joy” in German –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is the sense of pleasure derived from others’ misfortune. It’s a “poorly understood” emotion, according to a group of psychologists at Emory University in the US, and in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X18301430&quot;&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;New Ideas in Psychology&lt;/i&gt; they propose a new “tripartite” model of schadenfreude based on the idea that deep-seated survival concerns can motivate us to see others as less than human.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35151&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shensheng Wang and his colleagues Scott Lilienfeld and Philippe Rochat draw on evidence from three decades of social, developmental, personality and clinical research into schadenfreude. They begin by identifying three distinguishable but related sub-forms of the emotion, “each underpinned by a distinct concern [either aggression, rivalry, or justice] that has deep developmental roots, unfolding in infant and child development”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggression-related schadenfreude derives from the sense of social identity that develops during infancy. Strengthening one’s own social group can entail aggression towards others, and “aggression schadenfreude” is the type experienced by supporters of one football team when another team (not necessarily one they are playing) loses a match, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rivalry schadenfreude” is related to some extent, but is rooted in personal competition – the desire to do better than your peers. Envy can have a part to play in this, and Wang’s team note that both schadenfreude and envy emerge around 7 years of age (in fact some work has found jealousy, and subsequent schadenfreude toward the target of that jealousy, even in two-year-olds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third sub-form of schadenfreude is “justice-based” and is rooted in perceived fairness, which also develops early in childhood. Delight in the misfortune of a high-profile individual who is successful, but who has cheated in business and is then exposed and humiliated, would fall into this category,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all vary in our tendency to feel schadenfreude, the researchers note. For instance, there’s evidence that people with low self-esteem are more likely to perceive other people’s success as a threat to their self-evaluations, and to be more likely to experience schadenfreude as a result.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who score relatively highly on measures of the “dark triad” of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, as well as on the trait of sadism, also tend to feel more schadenfreude. All of these personality traits have been linked to dehumanisation – perceiving another person or members of a group as lacking at least some of the attributes that make us all human, the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that when people experience Schadenfreude, they undergo a [temporary] process similar to that experienced by individuals with high levels of psychopathic personality traits: motivated by certain situational and to a lesser extent dispositional variables, the perceiver tends to dehumanise the victim, temporarily losing the motivation to detect the victim’s mind, much like a psychopath,” they write. In fact, they argue, the process of dehumanisation “may lie at the core of this emotion”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of Wang and his colleagues’ “motivational model” of schadenfreude is that concerns of self-evaluation, social identity and justice “push” individuals towards schadenfreude, whereas “mind perception” (an understanding of what other people are thinking and feeling) pulls them away from it. “We argue that this motivational model of Schadenfreude would help integrate its multiple facets and offer a heuristic framework for embedding Schadenfreude research within the context of emotion theories,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate over the moral nature of schadenfreude has a long history, going back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who condemned it as a malicious emotion. In their conclusion, Wang and his team write: “We encourage researchers to subject our theoretical model to rigorous tests so that they can be either falsified or corroborated, ideally with the aim of bringing this provisional model more closely in line with psychological reality… A deeper appreciation of Schadenfreude may provide a valuable window into the diverse origins of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/&quot;&gt;darker side of humanity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: Pregnancy sculpts women’s brains in preparation for motherhood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5726</guid>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/pregnancy-sculpts-womens-brains-in-preparation-for-motherhood/</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5727 size-large&quot; height=&quot;682&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pexels-photo-396133-1024x682.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motherhood changes everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know before I had my boys how completely and utterly being their mother would change EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having children threw the pieces of my life up in the air. The pieces settled again, but my body, outlook on life, sense of self and emotions have never been quite the same. Not only did I birth two beautiful boys into the world, I birthed a new identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I realise it is the ultimate cliché, but motherhood changes everything. It recalibrates our life course and realigns our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience is not unique. Motherhood is one of the most fundamental transformations we go through as women. And for many of us, parenthood brings with it powerful identity changes and conflicting emotions: love, protectiveness, joy, nurturing, exhaustion, confusion, anger and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cocktail of pregnancy hormones prepares your body and brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a cocktail of hormones prepares your body for birth and breastfeeding. You grow an entirely new organ, the placenta, to ensure your baby receives nutrients and to buffer her against stress. Your metabolism resets to store energy for foetal development and lactation. Your breasts grow so you can nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your baby arrives, she’s often so irresistible you become consumed by her and spend much of your time caressing, holding, feeding, gazing at her and breathing in her scent. These maternal behaviours, as they’re called, are essential for the survival of your newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same cocktail profoundly alters the architecture of your expectant brain, in particular, the brain structures underlying social cognition and emotion. These brain changes last, and in both humans and non-human mammals, the differences in the brains and behaviours of mothers and non-mothers are evident throughout the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a new way to think about pregnancy — changes to your &lt;em&gt;body &lt;/em&gt;ensure your baby is carried safely to term; and changes to your &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt; ensure you’re prepared for the social and emotional challenges of motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in women’s brains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/images/Hoekzema_NN2016.pdf&quot;&gt;A paper&lt;/a&gt; published December 2016 in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; gave us our first detailed insight into how pregnancy changes the structure of women’s brains. Using MRI, a team of Dutch and Spanish researchers lead by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/senior-investigator/190-research-fellows/233-elseline-hoekzema&quot;&gt;Elseline Hoekzema&lt;/a&gt; scanned the brains of twenty-five first-time mothers before and after pregnancy, and compared their brains to twenty women who’d never been pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was associated with pronounced and long-lasting changes in the structure of women’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, grey matter volume was lost. The loss wasn’t random, but was from the same cortical regions in every woman, specifically, regions of the cortex related to social cognition, empathy and theory of mind, which is the ability to read the desires and intentions of others from their faces and actions. The hippocampus, a region associated with memory, also lost volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain changes were long-lasting. Two years after the initial scan, eleven of women who hadn’t fallen pregnant for the second time were invited back and their brains scanned again. In all women, the grey matter shrinkage had endured, except for in the hippocampus, which had recovered volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is grey matter shrinkage a good thing for a new Mum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the plastic changes are not dissimilar to those seen in adolescence when pubertal hormones trigger thinning of the grey matter in teenager’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Synaptic pruning in adolescence is generally regarded as an essential process of fine-tuning connections into functional networks and is thought to represent a refinement and specialization of brain circuitry, which is critical for healthy cognitive, emotional and social development,” says Hoekzema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely a similar process of maturation and specialisation of the social brain is taking place during pregnancy. Loss of grey matter volume sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more, and reflects ‘functional streamlining’, not degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain changes are related to empathy and reading the emotions of others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the grey matter changes occurred in regions associated with theory of mind and empathy, Hoekzema and her team ran a series of additional tests, to see if changes were related to real-life skills. Interestingly, data revealed the greater the degree of grey matter plasticity, the greater the strength of the connection and bonding between a mother and her baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, MRI and fMRI research examining brain structure shows changes to be very subtle and many thousands of people must be scanned to detect small differences. In this case, the grey matter changes induced by pregnancy were anything but subtle. Notably, a computer program was able to automatically determine whether or not a woman had undergone pregnancy based only on her brain scans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what is it about pregnancy that sculpts women’s brains?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoekzema and colleagues propose it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unequaled surges of sex steroid hormones that a woman is exposed to during her pregnancy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endocrine climate of pregnancy may drive grey matter refinement via changes in the number of synapses, glia, dendritic structures, blood vessels or myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of becoming a parent for the first time is an intense, all-encompassing experience, so the obvious question to ask is, whether it is pregnancy, the act of caring for a child, or another factor such as sleep deprivation that tinkers with brain structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tested for the effects of parenting versus pregnancy in a rather ingenious way — they scanned the brains of first-time fathers before and after their wife’s pregnancies. They found no changes in the structure of the men’s brains after they took on dad-duties, which strongly suggested any changes in the women were related to the biological changes of pregnancy rather than the process of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Similar brain changes are seen in other mammals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female rodents can’t read books to find out what to expect when they’re expecting or how to tame toddlers. Therefore, changes in how new rodent mothers think, feel and behave must be driven entirely by biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioural neuroscientists who study the neurobiology of parenting, say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maternal brain is both the goal of the endocrine tsunami that accompanies pregnancy, and the culmination of millennia of natural selective processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of maternal behaviours and superior cognitive abilities has been neatly mapped on to the ‘maternal circuitry’ in the female rodent brain. Like human mothers, rat mother’s brains are structurally different thanks to the hormones of pregnancy and the enriching experience of caring for their young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does this data mean pregnancy is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for parenthood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note this study does not imply fathers nor non-birth mothers lack the ‘parenting brain circuitry’ or a ‘theory of mind’, and it certainly does not let them off the hook from parenting! We don’t need neuroscience to support or deny that fact, anyway. Babies need warm, secure attachment with at least one loving caregiver to organise and regulate healthy brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is one very influential biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that benefit the transition into motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A birth mother is not the only adult capable of being such a caregiver. This data simply shows pregnancy is a very influential bottom-up biological factor in sculpting the female brain, and the changes to grey matter represent the refinement of social brain structures that may benefit the transition into motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In week 45:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; was pushed to the stable repositories. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/issue-labeling-scheme&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; does not build with
it yet, because &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/issue-labeling-scheme&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; tries to link with both &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; and its Python
bindings during the build. I've filed a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues/1063&quot;&gt;ticket upstream&lt;/a&gt;  to clarify if this
is correct. I have already &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/libneurosim/issues/12&quot;&gt;filed a PR&lt;/a&gt; that puts the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt;
Python bindings in the right location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-libNeuroML&quot;&gt;python-libNeuroML&lt;/a&gt; was pushed to the stable repositories and is now ready to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/56&quot;&gt;biosig&lt;/a&gt; is a WIP. It required &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libb64&quot;&gt;libb64&lt;/a&gt; which was approved this week and is
currently in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-duecredit&quot;&gt;python-duecredit&lt;/a&gt; is currently in testing. It should be pushed to stable in a
few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-visionegg-quest&quot;&gt;python-visionegg-quest&lt;/a&gt; is currently in testing. It should be pushed to stable in a
few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nibabel&quot;&gt;python-nibabel&lt;/a&gt; was updated to the latest version and is currently in
testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-grabbit&quot;&gt;python-grabbit&lt;/a&gt; was updated to the latest version and is currently in
testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the way to building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/3&quot;&gt;fsleyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fslpy&quot;&gt;fslpy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fsleyes-props&quot;&gt;fsleyes-props&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-fsleyes-widgets&quot;&gt;fsleyes-widgets&lt;/a&gt;
have all been reviewed, approved, and are now in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nitime&quot;&gt;python-nitime&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nilearn&quot;&gt;python-nilearn&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-petlink&quot;&gt;python-petlink&lt;/a&gt; was approved and is in testing. This also required an update
to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-simplewrap&quot;&gt;python-simplewrap&lt;/a&gt;. Upstream was really quick to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/spedemon/petlink/issues/2&quot;&gt;make the required fixes
for us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All new packages must go through &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;'s QA (testing) process before being
made available to end users in the repositories. You can help test these
packages following the instructions &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing?rd=QA/Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the software we worked on this week was related to neuro-imaging, and
fortunately, a lot of it was Python based which is usually quite simple to
build. The coming week, though, I intend to work on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; isn't the easiest to build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It depends on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv&quot;&gt;iv&lt;/a&gt;, which bundles a really old version of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/&quot;&gt;libtiff&lt;/a&gt;. I've filed
a ticket &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv/issues/3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about
this, but have not had the time to port the code to the newest version of
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/&quot;&gt;libtiff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; bundles &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/Random123&quot;&gt;Random123&lt;/a&gt;, which was relatively easy to remove. However,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; also bundles a really old version of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials&quot;&gt;SUNDIALS&lt;/a&gt; libraries, and
updating the code to use the latest versions is not straightforward. I have
filed an issue about it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; now. This is based on
my initial investigations into building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;. So there's a chance that
more work will need to be done once these issues are solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of software available in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; already. You can see the
complete list &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig&quot;&gt;here on Fedora SCM&lt;/a&gt;. Software that is currently
being worked on is listed &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;on our Pagure project instance&lt;/a&gt;. If you use software that
is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is always welcome. You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora#Communication_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; SIG is actively working on these packages, it would not
be possible without our friends in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; community that have helped with
the various stages of the package maintenance pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

before approving them for inclusion in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The awesome folks at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/releng&quot;&gt;releng&lt;/a&gt; have, of course, been super quick with SCM
requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're grateful to the various upstreams that we're bothering with issues, and
everyone in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; community (including people I may have missed) for
enabling us to further &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science&quot;&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;And other consequences of rewarding quantity, not quality&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8DNJNjcUxIbe9xYMJI95Zg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay/holdentrils&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name me the exceptional things you do once every five days. Not the basics of your ablutions, your plumbing, and stuffing your cake-hole with, um, cake. Not the daily cycle of home-work-home-TV. But the extra-ordinary things, the things that take that little extra effort. Watching a film at the cinema; playing sport; entertaining friends? Bathing the elephant; crocheting a teddy bear; continuing construction of your Lego cerebellum granule cell layer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about publishing a scientific paper? A singular work of deep scholarship, analysis, or experiment, publishing a scientific paper is an exceptional thing by anyone’s standards. A recent report in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8&quot;&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; a select group of scientists who published one paper every five days for at least a year. One paper every five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means each of these scientists was listed among the authors on at least 72 papers in a single calendar year. And these were not the thousand-plus lists of authors on papers from particle physics, not those gigantic teams of atom-smashers at CERN. These were papers about research into the effects of genes within large populations, or tracking human health over our lifespan, or neurology. Research that some would consider everyday, run-of-the-mill science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many possible reactions to this hyper-productive cadre. Some would feel the sting of inadequacy, contemplating how they sweated and bled on the torturous path to build one paper, and wondering how they took such a long and winding road when there exist scientists who can apparently produce effortlessly. Others would interpret the same contemplation of their own experience as awe, placing such evidently extraordinary scientific talents on a pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensible reaction is of the absurd. At that prodigious rate, the scientists who authored more than 72 papers a year are unlikely even to have read all of them. Let alone contributed directly to the work inside, writing a few words or providing some key idea. Let alone doing some meaningful science in their construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be permitted to think “what the fork!?” The mere existence of papers whose authors haven’t even read them is the big red flag that the exponential increase in scientific output is showing no signs of slowing down. Rough estimates claim somewhere between one to two million scientific papers are published every year. That’s 5470 every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: who are these papers for? Who are those one paper every 5 days for, if even their own authors have not read them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly, no one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a nihilistic version of this answer, which runs as follows. Papers exist as the productive unit of science. Measuring science by its papers reduces it to a time-and-motion study of counting the number of papers and proclaiming brilliance, to the weigh-in of a fishing competition where the heaviest stack of papers is proclaimed the winner. Potted biographies of famous scientists routinely say “Professor X has authored over 300 scientific articles”. And you wonder: really? (And also: how did he fit all that in with Magneto wiping his hard drive every five minutes?). The counting is what counts. Not the content, not the ideas, just the mere existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less nihilistic version of “no one” is that papers need not have an audience. Indeed, reading many of them, it becomes plain that the authors forget someone else is supposed to read these things, as they dive into their personal patois, piling noun upon noun upon noun until your brain is begging for an adverb, an adjective, hell even a pronoun would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, papers need not have an audience right now, but one day. For there are two types of scientific paper. There are those that give a shove to knowledge: they prove something right (we should all go in this direction); they prove something wrong (stop going in this direction); or they tell of a new method everyone should know about and use immediately. The kind of papers that make the mainstream news. (More accurately, papers dressed up to look like these kinds of shoves to knowledge make the news). These are the papers meant to be read right now. But they are few in number compared to the total outpouring of papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most papers are archival knowledge. Scientists find something out, make a record of it, and publish it as a paper. Then future scientists can build on it, use it, when there is a reason to. When it becomes apparent, for example, that knowing how a tiny piece of bacterial DNA fends off a virus is the basis for a technique that edits genes in literally anything’s DNA (CRISPR there).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archival knowledge idea might be less nihilistic, but it just pushes the problem into the future. Yes, we’d like to know what we already know; we’d like to not repeat the same ideas and experiments. But there is too much archival knowledge to imbibe. It’s like asking for a shot of single-malt whiskey, and getting a firehose of Jack Daniels in your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take dopamine. I like dopamine, and I’d like to know more about it. PubMed tells me that last year alone there were 4586 papers published on dopamine (in 2017). If I narrow that down to specifically dopamine and reward? 495 papers last year. And apparently five papers have so far been published on this in the future — 2019 (ah, academic publishing there, still so wedded to pre-digital tradition that papers which already exist have to be assigned a monthly “issue” of the journal in which they will formally appear. Despite that journal not having published on dead-tree pulp for a decade. Or ever.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but the prospect of reading 495 papers on dopamine and reward does not fill my heart with joy. Mainly a dull ache. And explicit tests of dopamine’s role in reward are just a tiny part of that story. Other things we’d like to know include how the neuron itself behaves; what its inputs are; where its outputs go; its responses to things that aren’t reward; its role in Parkinson’s disease; etcetera, etcetera. The archival knowledge about dopamine is growing faster than anyone could possibly comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also I’d like to read something that isn’t about dopamine. About how reward is encoded in prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, perhaps. About habit learning. About reinforcement learning. About cross-validated principal components analysis, because I’m just that cool. About Poppy, her hamster Wilberforce, and their starry-eyed misadventures in DoofusVille avoiding the clutches of Reginald the Malingerer and his hoard of ruffians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has no privileged position in The Flood of papers. In his biography of the insanely prolific mathematician Paul Erdos, Paul Hoffman calculated that close to a quarter of a million mathematical theorems were being published every year. Scientists have nothing on the productivity of mathematicians; but we’re drowning all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemplating The Flood leads us to some interesting conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one person can link together the existing web of literature about a single topic. And that web may never stop growing. It’s at the point where a single author of 72 papers a year cannot even link together their own papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means there is no single person who will know “the answer” to a given complex problem. So “the answer” can come in one of two guises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is a computational model of the problem. We see this epitomised in climate research. Huge computer models of the Earth’s climate synthesise an extraordinary amount of data, and bring together a vast array of individual bits of knowledge — about cycles of glacial melt and run-off, of reflections and trapping of sunlight, of feedback between carbon dioxide, temperature, and foliage, to name but a few. The model itself becomes the culmination of a vast research enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running those models gives us answers to complex problems: they might answer the questions of how temperature depends on carbon dioxide, of where those temperature changes will hit hardest and first, and of what changes to the Earth’s environment will stop those temperature changes from careening out of control. And building these models tell us what we &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; know, of where we need to fill in the gaps to make the models better, leaner, smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second guise is an AI. Groan. But the idea that an AI will someday “know” the answer should come as no surprise. After all, we already use machine-learning extensively to make sense of data-sets that are too big for one person to comb through. And what bigger data-set is there than the collective scientific knowledge of humanity? (Answer: Lego’s database of all possible permutations of small plastic bricks that make money).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06617-5&quot;&gt;It’s already happening&lt;/a&gt;. Do you not use Google or PubMed to search the literature? People are already using machine-learning to do systematic literature searches (Iris.ai, Semantic Scholar), to find links between research findings, and show them in a comprehensible form. These are fancy classifiers, learning to group together published work and data-sets by key words. Developments in language processing are beginning to let the machines link findings together to suggest hypotheses, like linking gene expression changes to mental disorders. The next step after that will be to have the machines write the literature reviews, synthesising existing knowledge into a form we mere mortals can understand, and pointing out to us what we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a machine to tell us what we don’t know is exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/05/journal-of-neuroscience-methods-paper.html&quot;&gt;Jessica and Bradley Voytek did&lt;/a&gt;. Scraping 3.5 million abstracts from PubMed, and linking them by key-words for brain regions, disorders, and cognitive functions, they built a model of neuroscientific knowledge. This model naturally has a hierarchy: “cortex”, “thalamus”, and “striatum” are all children of “brain”, for example. Which opened up a simple but effective hypothesis generator: find two concepts that share a parent, but have not been linked together in the existing literature. That pair of concepts are then candidates for linking together. (One can imagine generalising this even to a flat web of links, by seeking a pair of concepts that are each strongly associated with a third concept, but not (yet) strongly associated with each other.) Here is a dumb machine that already gives answers no human could possibly find on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as The Flood grows then, even in narrow disciplines, the machines will be the only ones who know all the links, the only ones that can put together the big picture. So even if we never develop a true AI that can by itself infer new hypotheses and create new ideas, even if that sci-fi scientist is off the table, we will still become dependent on dumb AI for the “answers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like these far-flung futures, the paper-every-5-days people still teach us a couple of valuable lessons for the here and now. For one, complaining about your work not being cited is churlish. Literatures are vast, people miss stuff, give them a break. Don’t complain, collaborate: point others to work they may have missed, and explain why it is relevant, and how it might inform their future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately they teach us that much of what we publish is worthless. I think we can safely say that any paper whose own authors haven’t read it is unlikely to contain ground-breaking information. The lesson to us all is that we should learn to ask: who am I publishing this paper for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more? Follow us at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markdhumphries&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@markdhumphries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=7ec6c5c965cf&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/handing-science-over-to-the-machines-7ec6c5c965cf&quot;&gt;Handing Science Over to the Machines&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Breech birth at home: a new study of safety outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10633</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/09/breech-birth-at-home-a-new-study-of-safety-outcomes/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/new-born-615751_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stuart Fischbein, MD, FACOG: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trained in an era and a hospital that did not see properly selected breech birth as high risk. I have supported this option my entire 32-year career. In 2010, for reasons having nothing to do with outcomes, my hospital system chose to ban vaginal breech birth as well as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). There was no hearing, no discussion, no review of the literature, and certainly no concern for our ethical obligation to offer reasonable choices to our clients and to allow them the option of informed consent and refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I had been collaborating with and assisting midwives for three decades as a back-up physician for home birth transports. In 2010, I left the hospital and began my home birth career. Unbound by rigid protocols put in place by committees and risk managers, I was free to individualize my care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my years in home birth practice, I became aware that we obstetricians project a lot of anxiety onto the women we care for. In healthy women, pregnancy is a normal physiological bodily function that works best when the women are in a safe, private environment. Midwives are experts at normal birth and, in my experience, their model of care leads to better outcomes and higher rates of satisfaction. We, as obstetricians, can learn much from them. A collaborative model, as I have adopted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our recent study&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to better outcomes with less intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most breech studies compare vaginal breech birth (VBB) to planned cesarean section. We chose to compare VBB to a similar cohort planning vaginal cephalic birth. Selection criteria for breech were more rigid than for cephalic, but outcomes were similar in both groups. Although our numbers were too small to capture rare adverse events, intrapartum transports and perineal integrity were much more related to parity than to presenting part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While breech birth at home may not be the ideal for most, it remains the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; choice for many women in this country other than cesarean for breech birth. We published this paper to show what can be done with motivated mothers in skilled hands. Success rates of multiparous mothers for vaginal birth in both groups were 100%. To not offer VBB to these women is professionally irresponsible. Even primiparous breech mothers had a 76% success rate at home. This information deserves a place in informed consent discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our efforts should not be put into restricting choice but into honoring our ethical obligations to the women we serve. We can support this goal by learning and then teaching the skills that make our profession unique, by supporting colleagues who offer vaginal breech birth, and by advocating for more robust breech training &amp;amp; education from our professional societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rixa Freeze, PhD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence since the Term Breech Trial is clear that the short-term risks of VBB to the baby are small—sometimes even identical to planned cesarean section (see infographic below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we cannot forget the long-term risks of cesarean section to the baby and the short- and long-term risks to the mother. Despite this evidence, VBB is nearly impossible to obtain in the United States. For many women, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; option for a vaginal breech birth is at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2033-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; is the largest of its kind on breech birth at home. Larger datasets exist, but they do not include information about provider skill level, selection criteria, type of breech presentation, or whether the breech presentation was diagnosed before the onset of labor—all factors we addressed in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that breech birth at home leads to high rates of vaginal birth and good maternal outcomes (including postpartum transfers, blood loss, and perineal integrity). However, with only 50 breech presentations at the onset of labor, our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about uncommon adverse neonatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more high-quality data on home breech outcomes. What if we could analyze 500 home breech births rather than 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing women enormous harm by taking away their bodily autonomy when their baby is breech. In theory, state and federal laws support the principle of informed consent and informed refusal, and nearly every hospital has a patient’s bill of rights that ensures consent before medical procedures. Yet we throw these legal and ethical rights away when a baby turns bottom-first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better. We owe it to the women we care for. Women should not be forced to leave the hospital in order to exercise their right to informed consent. Every woman with a breech baby deserves access to skilled providers &lt;em&gt;in her own community&lt;/em&gt; who can support her, whether she chooses a planned cesarean section or a vaginal breech birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Outrage: It’s absolutely everywhere. Today’s world, particularly the version of it blasted into our brains by social media, offers endless fodder, from big, simmering outrages (climate change and many powerful institutions’ refusal to do anything about it) to smaller quotidian ones (every day, someone, somewhere does something offensive that comes to Twitter’s attention, leading to a gleeful pile-on).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In part because of rising awareness of the adverse consequences of unfettered digital-age outrage, and of journalistic treatments like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/april-2015/powerful-crazy-cruel&quot;&gt;So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; by Jon Ronson (which I interviewed him about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/jon-ronson-on-monica-lewinsky-and-cybershaming.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outrage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; has become a particularly potent dirty word in recent years. Outrage, the thinking goes, is an overly emotional response to a confusing world, and drives people to nasty excesses, from simple online shaming to death threats or actual violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But a new paper argues that the concept of outrage has gotten too bad a rap and that its upsides, especially as a motivator of collective action and costly helping, have been overlooked. Writing  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302249&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the psychologists Victoria Spring, Daryl Cameron and Mina Cikara detail important questions about outrage that have yet to be answered, and they highlight how certain findings – especially from the “intergroup relations” literature, in contrast to the mostly negative findings from moral psychology – suggest it can serve a useful purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35155&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;They cite two experiments, for example, in which “both naturally occurring outrage (about an ongoing conflict) and induced outrage (manipulated via video footage about the conflict) predict[ed] greater support for nonviolent peacemaking policies relative to ‘induced hope’ and ‘neutral’ emotion manipulations. Similarly, women who read that the majority of men harbour hostile sexist beliefs (versus benevolent sexist beliefs or gender-unrelated beliefs) exhibit[ed] increased anger and fury, which predict[ed] intentions to participate—and actual participation—in collective action for equal salaries. By contrast, reappraisal, aimed at reducing negative emotions such as outrage, reduce[d] participants’ reported intentions to engage in political action.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That’s all fair enough. But arguing that researchers — or anyone else — focus too much on the downsides of outrage feels like an uphill battle to fight in 2018. There are endless, endless examples of online outrage spreading out of control, doing damage most people would view as disproportionate. In 2015, for example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/victim-of-a-scary-web-shaming-speaks-out.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I wrote about&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; a woman who was driven from her home as a result of death threats after she made a failed and offensive joke about a slain law enforcement officer — and as Ronson and others have documented, there are a million stories like this one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Now, few people would deny that outrage is an important impulse for helping to make the world a better place, and for dealing with those who breach important norms. But there are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;many&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; aspects of human nature that have fundamentally important purposes, but which can also go haywire in certain contexts — especially given that most of us are now living in situations far removed from those in which our ancestors lived and evolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Take, well, cheeseburgers: Humans have evolved tendencies to seek out high-calorie foods. This tendency helped keep us alive during the evolutionary history that brought us to now. For most of that history, scarcity was the norm — a double bacon cheeseburger, to a European or African peasant hundreds of years ago, would have been a caloric bonanza the likes of which they had never before seen and might never see again. Today, of course, in much of the developed world we’re lucky not to face this sort of paucity of calories. In fact, the situation has improved so much that many of us face the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;opposite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; problem: too many calories, too easily consumed (you can buy a double bacon cheeseburger for just a few pounds, if that, whenever you want). That’s part of the reason countries like the UK and the United States have certain health problems: Many people consume far more calories than they should, because there’s so much affordable energy-rich food everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To argue that researchers or anyone else are failing to see the positive sides of outrage, in 2018, feels a bit like arguing that people are failing to see the positive sides of our desire for rich and fatty foods. It’s true, at a basic level, that it’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; we’re drawn to calories: Without that drive, we wouldn’t survive. But in 2018, for those fortunate to live in food-secure places, no one is wanting for calories, and a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;surfeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of calories is the more important and societally relevant problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Similarly, we have so many opportunities, every moment of every day, to express outrage, and so many opportunities to accidentally contribute to disproportionate anger directed at faceless, distant strangers, that it feels as though social media, 24-hour news, and other media innovations are taking a fundamentally important human drive — the ability to get outraged at norm breaches — and blowing it up into something ugly and maladaptive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Spring and her coauthors conclude their paper by writing that “we hope to promote a more complete view of outrage—as an emotion that might lead to interpersonal antagonism, but that may also act as a lever for activism on a societal scale.” And that’s a worthy goal: There’s a sturdy body of literature showing that emotion, in general, is more likely to get people to act in prosocial ways than dryer, more empirical appeals — there’s a deep truth behind the well-worn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” But that same feeling of righteous anger that can, in one case, lead people to donate to the less fortunate can, in the next, turn those same people against (to take one example) innocent migrants seeking a better life. Outrage is big and messy and hard to contain — we need it, on a fundamental level, but we should never forget its many dangers and the many ways in which it can lead to negative and inhumane outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302249&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Upside of Outrage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Two and a half years after Maria Fousteri was found guilty of scientific misconduct by her former employer, the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), exactly nothing at all happened. ERC and Molecular Cell ignored LUMC letters from June 2016, while Fouster's British co-authors interfered to save own papers. Of 4 scheduled retractions, none took place.</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: What is inside the head of the fossil predatory fish †Saurichthys?</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/11/08/what-is-inside-the-head-of-the-fossil-predatory-fish-%e2%80%a0saurichthys/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-fossil-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to our close connection to the land we live on, as well as the daily interactions we have with domesticates and wildlife around us, we may often forget that collectively, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals represent less than half of the ‘leaves’ of the vertebrate tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over 50% of living species of vertebrates are ray-finned bony fishes (Actinopterygii), a clade that has been around for almost half a billion years. Despite being masked by an overall fish-like appearance, actinopterygians comprise fossil and living evolutionary lineages that are, in loose evolutionary terms, as distinct as those of frogs and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;†Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the origins of major ray-fin lineages remain obscure. The assignment of early actinopterygian fossils to the correct branch of the tree of life remains an obstacle to acquiring a more complete picture of vertebrate evolution, and its course through major extinction events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, ray-finned fossils are found crushed in two dimensions by overlying sediments. This does not allow the observation of tremendously important internal skeletal features (e.g. the braincase, sensory structures and gill bones). Luckily, on rare occasions, carcasses were encrusted quickly in pebble-shaped nodules that secured their three-dimensional preservation, protecting the integrity of internal structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical investigations, from the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, of the internal anatomy of 3D early actinopterygians still form the core of our knowledge on the subject. Early works have employed destructive techniques, such as serial grinding, to describe internal features. As one can imagine, these results were of limited accuracy and are non-reproducible, since the original specimens were destroyed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Palaeozoic–Mesozoic †Saurichthyiformes were an iconic group of early actinopterygians, which reigned aquatic ecosystems for almost 80 million years and even survived the biggest mass extinction in the history of life. They were the first to evolve the typical ‘ambush predator’ (torpedo-like) body shape, which is nowadays encountered in gars, or needlefish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destructive investigations of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes, conducted in the 1920s, pointed towards a close relationship with modern paddlefishes and sturgeons (which are best known for their delicious eggs ‒ caviar). Although widely accepted, this hypothesized close relationship rested on weak anatomical arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we revisited the internal anatomy of †Saurichthyiformes by employing computed X-ray microtomography on 3D fossils of two species of †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; from the Early Triassic of Nepal and East Greenland.  This method is non-destructive, and results in high-resolution digital models that can be easily studied from different angles, enabling accurate comparisons with other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10597&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10597 size-large&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichtys-Skull-1024x518.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Different stages of study of the skull of †Saurichthys from East Greenland. From external anatomical interpretation (top), to digital reconstruction of X-ray tomograms (bottom). Scale bar = 1cm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We digitally reconstructed internal skeletal structures, such as the braincase, jaws, and gills. We also visualized the spaces that were, in life, occupied by the brain, cranial nerves and blood vessels, as well as the inner ear. This allowed us to infer the shape and/or course of the actual soft-tissue structures. Our reconstructions led to new anatomical discoveries, but also revealed critical flaws in classical works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst our new discoveries is the presence of large empty spaces in the snout. Additionally, we found that a bone (dermohyal), which was previously thought to be missing in †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt;, was actually fused to another bone (hyomandibula). Both features are primitive. Interestingly, we found that the gill-cover bone architecture of †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; is very similar to that of modern sturgeons and paddlefishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this new anatomical knowledge in its evolutionary context, we compared †&lt;em&gt;Saurichthys&lt;/em&gt; with a variety of fossil and living ray-finned fishes. With the help of specialized algorithms, we analyzed a large dataset of morphological characters from dozens of bony fishes, in order to trace evolutionary affinities on the basis of anatomical similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10658&quot; style=&quot;width: 241px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10658&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Saurichthys-Brain-231x300.png&quot; width=&quot;231&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Tomographic renderings of brain, osseus labyrinth and nasobasal canal endocasts of †Saurichthys sp. (NHMD_157546_A)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from Article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting historical phylogenetic hypotheses, the evolutionary trees produced by our analyses do not recover †Saurichthyiformes as closely related to sturgeons and paddlefishes, implying that many of their similarities have likely evolved independently (convergently). However, the lack of internal skeletal data for many other early actinopterygians precludes a clear picture of the early ray-fin tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be too many fossil fishes out there and not enough time (and resources) to study them.  It might even seem that this work only scratches the surface of early actinopterygian evolution. Yet, through works like this, we are able to better locate specific morphological characters and also fossil species that are responsible for ‘reshuffling’ the branches of the largest partition of the vertebrate tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented anatomical knowledge of the internal skeleton of †Saurichthyiformes will doubtlessly form a solid basis for further comparisons with new fossils. Moreover, our research highlights the fact that established classical interpretations of actinopterygian anatomy need to be critically reappraised in light of new material and modern methods of anatomical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of a brown lion. Multiple tiny, green, spinning Catherine wheels with red edges. Colourful fragments of artillery soldiers and figures in uniform and action. Unfamiliar faces of well-groomed men… These are just a few of the hallucinations reported by a group of people with macular degeneration (MD), a common cause of vision loss in people aged over 40.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 per cent of people with MD – who lose vision in the centre of their visual field but whose peripheral vision is generally unaffected – develop Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), reporting hallucinations that vary from simple flashes of light and shapes to faces, animals and even complex scenes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that CBS might arise as a result of over-responsiveness – “hyper-excitability” – of certain visual regions of the cortex, after they are deprived of normal retinal input. But whether this really is the case –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and why some people with reduced vision or blindness develop them, while others don’t – has not been clear. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31142-4&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; by a team of psychologists at the University of Queensland, Australia, led by David Painter, and published in &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt;, offers some answers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35158&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painter and his team studied eight people with MD and Charles Bonnet syndrome (whose regular hallucinations include those listed at the start of this post); eight age- and gender-matched people with MD but without CBS; and eight matched controls with healthy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers presented the participants with a series of red and green flickering chequerboard patterns, to stimulate the intact peripheral region of their retinas. Using EEG (electroencephalography)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to monitor the participants’ brain activity, the researchers found a much bigger response to the flickering patterns in the early vision processing regions of the cortex in the people with MD who also have CBS, compared with both the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the CBS participants reported experiencing hallucinations during the study, so hyper-excitability of these visual processing regions does not automatically trigger hallucinations, but does seem to be a feature of the brains of people who are susceptible to them.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise triggers for hallucinations in people with CBS vary. They include low light levels, or watching TV or riding in a car. Exactly how these triggers might interact with the over-responsiveness of the visual cortex to generate hallucinations is yet to be explored.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike people with schizophrenia, individuals with CBS usually have no trouble recognising that their hallucinations are not real, and most don’t find them distressing. However a minority do, and further research may lead to treatments, write Painter and his colleagues.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings, future treatments could aim to down-regulate cortical hyperexcitability in CBS,” they write,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“perhaps through repeated application of non-invasive brain stimulation protocols that induce long-lasting plastic changes in underlying cortical networks.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31142-4&quot;&gt;Stimulus-Driven Cortical Hyperexcitability in Individuals with Charles Bonnet Hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Can psychology help your cooking taste better?&lt;/strong&gt; Our presenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginnysmithscience.com&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt; hears about the importance of food presentation, pairing and sequencing, and how our perception of food is a multi-sensory experience. She and her friends conduct a taste test using “sonic seasonings” that you can also try at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=zellnerd&quot;&gt;Professor Debra Zellner&lt;/a&gt; at MontClaire State University and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/charles-spence&quot;&gt;Professor Charles Spence&lt;/a&gt; at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have sought to look under the hood to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/30/psychotherapy-has-drug-like-effect-on-the-brain/&quot;&gt;the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. Not only can such understanding help us hone in on the precise processes that are being acted upon in therapy, thus helping us focus on these gains, they could also show where pharmacological interventions might be complementary, and where they could directly obstruct the therapeutic work. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492717303323?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Neuroimaging&lt;/i&gt; has outlined all we know so far about how therapy changes the depressed brain, and it suggests key changes occur in emotional processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35105&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team, led by Cynthia Fu and first-author Anjali Sankar at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience in London and the University of East London, conducted a search of the brain imaging literature, looking specifically for&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;studies that uncovered the brain changes associated with recovery from depression following various forms of psychotherapy, including CBT and psychodynamic psychotherapy.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17 papers they gathered hinted at some consistent patterns, such as decreased amygdala activity after therapy when looking at both emotional and more neutral stimuli, but there were also occasional results that were harder to square – for instance one study showed more activation in hippocampal areas while another study found less activation in the very same region. This inconsistency is to be expected for a still-young domain of investigation, especially when different labs are experimenting with different study designs, so shouldn’t be over-interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the review is most valuable is through the use of a meta-analysis of five studies that asked volunteers with depression to look at emotional images in the brain scanner before and after they had undertaken psychotherapy.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This showed that, after CBT, patients with major depression showed less activation in the left precentral gyrus. This area is in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is involved in thinking and reflective processes. People who are depressed exhibit more activity in this area during emotional tasks, which appears to reflect their tendency to over-process and ruminate on thoughts and worries. As such, the reduction in prefrontal cortex activity after therapy may indicate the effectiveness of therapy in discouraging such negative cognitive styles – taking things for what they are rather than using them as a springboard into contemplating a worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that, after CBT or psychodynamic psychotherapy, patients showed more activation in&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the left rostral (pregenual) anterior cingulate (see image above; healthy controls did not show this change, suggesting it was not simply due to the passage of time or practice effects at the image-viewing task). This brain area is strongly connected with core emotion processing regions, including having a suppressing effect on activity in the amygdala. Evidence already suggests that the connections between the anterior cingulate and the amygdala are weaker in major depression, explaining why emotions may feel more overwhelming. So it appears that one of the effects of psychotherapy may be the re-establishment of this damaged connection. The meta-analysis can’t tell us exactly how, but one possibility is through practices such as “cognitive re-appraisal” – finding new ways of interpreting difficult experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fu and Sankar and the rest of their team emphasise that we’re still in early days of making sense of the relationships between brain changes and clinical response, especially the extent of improvement – for instance, how much does an increase in pleasure in life relate to changes in a particular brain region? They note &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033745&quot;&gt;a study from 2012&lt;/a&gt; that took this approach, finding that extent of improvement on a depression inventory correlated with the activity change in the anterior cingulate cortex, reinforcing that this may be a key brain region worthy of further examination.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we’re still chipping away at the gargantuan task of mapping how the process of therapy plays out in the neural tissue that sits within our skulls. It’s an endeavour worth continuing – as Sankar and colleagues explain, “Understanding the mechanisms of treatments on brain activity has the potential for developing diagnostic biomarkers and identifying new targets for beneficial forms of treatment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492717303323?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis of the neural correlates of psychological therapies in major depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In temporal information processing, both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play essential roles. In particular, for interval timing learning, the cerebellum exhibits temporally localized activity around the onset of the unconditioned stimulus, whereas the basal ganglia represents the passage of time by their ramping-up activity from the onset of the conditioned stimulus to that of the unconditioned stimulus. We present a unified computational model of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia for the interval timing learning task. We report that our model reproduces the localized activity in the cerebellum and the gradual increase of the activity in the basal ganglia. These results suggest that the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play different roles in temporal information processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the unexpected outcome of two votes shook the world: the UK voting to leave the European Union, and the US electing President Donald Trump. Even the pollsters got it wrong – for example, based on the latest polling data, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; gave Clinton an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html&quot;&gt;85 per cent chance&lt;/a&gt; of winning just the day before the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate polling is important for a number of reasons. Poll results influence politicians’ campaign strategies and fundraising efforts; affect market prices and business forecasts; and they can impact voters’ perceptions and even turnout. So, when the polls are wide of the mark – as they were so badly in 2016 – many outcomes are being sent astray by misleading information.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But polling is not as simple as just asking a lot of people who they intend to vote for. Polls are often biased by who is motivated enough to respond, and people can be overly-optimistic about the likelihood they will actually vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor, outlined by Andy Brownback and Aaron Novotny of the University of Arkansas in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804318301174&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental and Behavioural Economics&lt;/i&gt;, is people feeling the need to conceal their true voting intentions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35133&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially desirable responding (SDR) can occur when people feel their position is socially unacceptable, like voting against an ethnic minority or female politician, or when revealing their views on sensitive issues such as immigration and same-sex marriage. For instance, it’s plausible that some people told pollsters they were going to vote for Clinton, while actually intending to vote for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether this was really happening, Brownback and Novotny conducted three experiments during the 2016 presidential campaign, including a telephone survey of 800 people of voting age in Arkansas, and a survey of almost 2000 US voters on Mechanical Turk.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ingenious method to tease out participants’ true or “implicit” preferences involved presenting those in the “implicit” condition with four statements around hot-button issues like gun control and climate change. The statements were balanced to reflect both conservative and liberal views, such that participants were unlikely to agree with all four. For example, people who agreed with “I think the threat of global warming is exaggerated” tended not to agree with “I prefer presidential candidates who oppose the NRA”, and vice versa. There was also a critical fifth statement, either “I often find myself agreeing with Donald Trump” or “I often find myself agreeing with Hillary Clinton”. In this implicit condition, participants were simply asked to give a total number, from 0 to 5, regarding how many statements they agreed with – the idea being that they would feel their preference for Trump or Clinton was hidden within their overall tally.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ scores in the implicit condition were later contrasted with the scores of participants in an “explicit” condition, in which they rated how many of the exact same policy statements they agreed with,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;and then, completely separately, they answered either, “Do you often find yourself agreeing with Donald Trump, yes or no?” or&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“Do you often find yourself agreeing with Hillary Clinton, yes or no?”. In this explicit condition, their candidate preference was totally transparent (more like in a typical poll), and their answer to this final question was added to the number of policy statements they agreed with. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that participants in both conditions had a score out of 5. Because participants in the implicit condition were able to indicate they agreed with Trump without admitting so overtly, then if socially desirable responding was occurring, we would expect the total number of statements agreed with to be higher when Trump featured in the implicit condition than the explicit condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what the researchers found with the results suggesting people were more likely to express agreement with Trump in the implicit condition, and more likely to agree with Clinton in the explicit condition. Interestingly, the researchers found that there was no significant effect of political ideology, so those with more conservative views weren’t more likely to show socially desirable responding than those with liberal views (based on six questions about economic ideology, covering topics like taxation, government spending and immigration). However, party affiliation did have an effect: registered Democrats in particular were more likely to suggest agreement with Trump in the implicit condition. Party identification, then, seems more important in producing this social desirability effect than the political beliefs that presumably underpin that choice. This is important, because it means socially desirable responding exacerbates the differences between the two parties, suggesting voters in each camp have less in common than they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While finding evidence of socially desirable responding in polling is interesting, it is unclear how this implicit test method could be used for more accurate polls in future, as the data it produces is too noisy. However, another group of researchers has tried a different approach with more obvious practical implications: asking people who their social circle are voting for. We know that when one person votes, their immediate family and friends are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Connected-Surprising-Networks-Friends-Everything/dp/0316036137/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;15 per cent more likely&lt;/a&gt; to vote too, and it’s likely voting choices are influenced in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0302-y&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, Mirta Galesic at the Santa Fe Institute and Max Plank Institute, and colleagues, tested this hypothesis not only with regards to the 2016 US election, but also the 2017 presidential election in France. They found that, in both cases, asking people if and how their social circle intended to vote was a more accurate predictor of the outcome than when participants only provided their own intentions or their prediction of who would win. In fact, in one poll, the researchers found that the social circle question was almost twice as accurate as reporting one’s own intentions (82 per cent vs. 46 per cent) in the five key swing states that lost Clinton the election. Asking about participants’ social circles means they don’t have to reveal their own potentially embarrassing preferences, and it indirectly increases the sample size of the poll itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was also able to track social influence over time, as the researchers started polling both personal intentions and social circle intentions in July and continued weekly until after the US voted in November. One week before the election, more participants said they would vote for Clinton than Trump. Yet, as early as September, these polls accurately predicted Trump’s win as people reported a swing towards him in their social circles. Not only that, but people who reported an intention to vote differently from their social circle were much more likely to change their own position at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pattern the researchers observed is how participants’ social circles become echo chambers. In August, supporters of both candidates reported that only around two-thirds of their social circle agreed with them. By November, Trump supporters had become much more homogenised, with 40 per cent reporting that 90 per cent or more of their circle now also supported Trump, relative to only 30 per cent of Clinton supporters saying the same. This could be for a number of reasons: switching support from third parties, deciding to vote when they originally weren’t going to, or even freezing out people who disagreed with their political views.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complementary strands of research both demonstrate flaws in traditional polling, and ways of addressing them in future. It seems likely that people represent their preferences in a socially desirable light, but it would be difficult to use the statement list methodology to predict an election outcome. Asking about a person’s social circle is a much more effective way of obtaining more accurate results, and also sheds light on other social processes at work. Hopefully this will be adopted more widely going forward, to improve polling accuracy and avoid any last-minute surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9763</link>
	<description>Earlier this year, I posted on how Sergio Della Salla, the editor of Cortex, criticized a headline-grabbing JAMA paper that had reported neuropsychological abnormalities in US embassy staff exposed to the mysterious Havana 'sonic attack'. According to Della Salla, the evidence presented didn't suggest enduring cognitive deficits in the victims.



Now, Della Salla is back (along with co-authors) for round two with a new paper, called Cognitive symptoms in US government personnel in Cuba: The</description>

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Gloria Choi, Ph.D. Named 2018 Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award Winner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11446</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/gloria-choi-ph-d-named-2018-peter-gruss-young-investigator-award-winner/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) announces that Dr. Gloria Choi is the second biennial Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient. Choi is an Assistant Professor at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. Her research focuses on olfaction and social cues, as well as neuroimmunology and neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored and deeply grateful. Being recognized as the Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award winner adds to my motivation to continue striving for good, exciting and important scientific research,” said Dr. Choi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Choi received her Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Neurobiology &amp;amp; Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY, in the laboratory of Nobel Prize-winning researcher Richard Axel. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including being named one of Cell Magazine’s 40 Under 40 in 2014. As the 2018 Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award recipient, she will be honored with a special presentation and will give a talk at MPFI’s national Sunposium conference, which takes place March 4-6, 2019 in West Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gloria Choi’s achievements continue to push the boundaries of neuroscience forward, and her ability to bring her full focus, creativity, and intellectual curiosity to a question is clearly evident in the groundbreaking research that she has already published so early in her career,” wrote Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute, who nominated Choi for this award. Desimone went on to say that Choi is a “creative and collaborative researcher who is certainly an inspiration to other young scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peter Gruss Young Investigator Award is given biennially to recognize a young neuroscience investigator for significant contributions to the scientific community through collaboration, creativity, and curiosity-driven research. In addition to recognizing exceptional achievements, it also serves to support research, inspire young scientists, promote cooperation, and acknowledge the outstanding legacy that Dr. Peter Gruss built throughout his honorable career at the Max Planck Society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/images/20181005-NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroFedora logo!&quot; class=&quot;text-center img-responsive pagination-centered&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/images/20181005-NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In week 44:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-PyLEMS&quot;&gt;PyLEMS&lt;/a&gt; was imported into Fedora and is now in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-PyLEMS&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We received a suggestion to include &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsleyes&quot;&gt;fsleyes&lt;/a&gt;, so we've begun working on that.
Two of its dependencies are in review now: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1645329&quot;&gt;fslpy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1645661&quot;&gt;fsleyes-widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in line with the spirit of FOSS development, we try to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects&quot;&gt;stay close to
upstream&lt;/a&gt;, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-PyLEMS&quot;&gt;PyLEMS&lt;/a&gt;: issues were filed to request that &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/LEMS/pylems/issues/42&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/LEMS/pylems/issues/39&quot;&gt;license
text&lt;/a&gt; be included in the PyPi
tarball.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroMLlite&quot;&gt;NeuroMLlite&lt;/a&gt;: I opened a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroMLlite/pull/2&quot;&gt;PR adding the license file to the sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC&quot;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/a&gt;: Unfortunately &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC&quot;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/a&gt; uses a private copy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mflood/rudeconfig&quot;&gt;rudeconfig&lt;/a&gt; that contains
changes that have not yet been sent upstream. Bundling is &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Bundling_and_Duplication_of_system_libraries&quot;&gt;to be avoided&lt;/a&gt;
in Fedora for good reason, so I've filed a ticket &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC/issues/56&quot;&gt;asking if the local
changes to rudeconfig could be sent upstream&lt;/a&gt;. Until this is solved,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC&quot;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/a&gt; cannot be included in Fedora, unless a bundling exception is made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task list was moved to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;Pagure issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.
I've done a bit of housekeeping so that we now use labels like the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/issue-labeling-scheme&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt;
initiative does, inspired by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63#.ve6i7zcou&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
It really does make handling issues much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of software available in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; already. You can see the
complete list &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig&quot;&gt;here on Fedora SCM&lt;/a&gt;. Software that is currently
being worked on is listed &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;on our Pagure project instance&lt;/a&gt;. If you use software that
is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is always welcome. You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora#Communication_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
