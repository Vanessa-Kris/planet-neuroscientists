&lt;p&gt;It’s a trick that politicians have long exploited: repeat a false statement often enough, and people will start believing that it’s true. Psychologists have named this phenomenon the “illusory truth effect”, and it seems to come from the fact that we find it easier to process information that we’ve encountered many times before. This creates a sense of fluency which we then (mis)interpret as a signal that the content is true. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you might like to believe that your particular way of thinking makes you immune to this trick. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/n7bze/&quot;&gt;according to a pre-print uploaded recently to PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt;, you’d be wrong. In a series of experiments, Jonas De keersmaecker at Ghent University and his collaborators found that individual differences in cognition had no bearing on the strength of the illusory truth effect.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37408&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers wondered whether three aspects of cognition, already known to influence how people make judgments, could determine how prone someone is to the illusory truth effect: cognitive ability or intelligence; the need for cognitive closure (i.e. the desire to avoid ambiguity); and cognitive style (whether someone thinks in a rapid and intuitive manner or takes a slower and more analytic approach). For example, someone who relies more on intuition and wants hard-and-fast answers might be more likely to use the fact that information has been repeated as a cue to its truthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across six experiments involving between 199 and 336 participants, the team measured the illusory truth effect while also tapping into these aspects of cognition. The exact methods varied for each study, but generally participants would first read a mix of true and false trivia statements, then complete various cognitive tests and surveys, and finally they would re-read and judge as true or false the earlier trivia statements, as well as new ones interspersed among them. A seventh study was similar but involved fake and real political headlines (the participants’ final challenge in this case was to judge which were real and which were made up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the illusory truth effect across all seven studies: participants were more likely to rate trivia statements and headlines as true/real if they’d seen them previously. Crucially, the strength of this effect did not vary according to the participants’ cognitive ability or style, or need for closure. (A couple of studies found some small significant associations, but these disappeared when the researchers integrated all the data.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that we are all predisposed to believe repeated information regardless of our own particular cognitive profile. And while that might make us all susceptible to advertising and the fabrications of dishonest politicians, the researchers have a more optimistic take. “These novel findings are in line with the assertion that processing fluency is not a judgmental bias and flaw in the individual, but rather a cue to truth that is universal and epistemologically justified in most contexts”, they write. In other words, it’s not that there’s a foolish subgroup of people who are more vulnerable to the “illusory truth” effect, but rather it’s an advantageous and universal bias that’s arisen because most of the time fluency actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a reliable signal of truth. For example, a statement that is often repeated may tend to be endorsed by more people, which could be a useful cue to its truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual differences relating to the illusory truth effect waiting to be discovered, the team adds. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, seem to show a less strong effect, suggesting that certain fundamental aspects of memory and cognition may be required to support the effect. With a greater willingness to publish null results like this one – and not just leave them in the file drawer – researchers should be able to build up a much more complete picture of the illusory truth effect and other cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be best advised not to read this article late at night or before you eat. Psychologists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Charles University in the Czech Republic have surveyed a large sample of non-clinical volunteers to gauge their reaction to 24 creatures that are commonly the source of specific animal phobias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12409&quot;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not only contribute to our understanding of animal phobias, but could prove incredibly useful to horror writers. Among the key findings is that spiders were unique in being both intensely fear- &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; disgust-inducing in equal measure. The researchers said this may be due to their mix of disgusting properties – including their “quirky ‘too-many-legs’ body plan” – combined with the fact they are “…omnipresent in our homes, often lurking in the hidden dark places and capable of fast unpredictable movement.” In other words, the intense fear arises in part from the prospect of coming into physical contact with a creature perceived by many to be revolting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37399&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jakub Polák and his team recruited nearly 2000 people online and asked them to rate how frightening and disgusting they found 25 creatures, including – alongside the spider – a snail, dog, bull, maggot, cockroach, two kinds of snake (a viper and a grass snake), and ant. See the image above for the full list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted in photographs on-screen, this particular selection of species – aside from the red panda, which acted as a non-fear-inducing control – was chosen because they are frequently the source of animal phobias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorising the creatures based on the levels of fear and disgust that they elicited, the researchers identified five groupings: fear-relevant, non-slimy small animals, such as cockroaches, ants and wasps; mouse-like animals, such as mouse, rat and bat, which scored low on elicited fear and disgust; snakes and lizards; parasites, such as lice and tapeworm, which triggered high disgust; and finally, farm or pet mammals, such as cat, dog and horse, which generally elicited low fear and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation for common animal phobias is that they reflect an exaggerated, uncontrolled form of innate fears for certain creatures that we all share, particularly for creatures that imperilled our ancestors, such as spiders and snakes. Consistent with this evolutionary account, spiders and venomous snakes elicited the strongest fear reactions among the participants, while parasites elicited the strongest disgust reactions (consistent with the idea that disgust motivates a form of protective “behavioural avoidance”). However, less consistent with the evolutionary perspective on animal phobias is that 14 of the creatures elicited virtually no fear, including rats, mice and lizards, even though these animals are commonly the source of phobias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that, similar to spiders, the parasitic creatures like tape-worm and roundworm were both highly disgust-inducing (even more than the spider) while at the same time being rated as highly fear-inducing (even more than, say, the wasp or grass-snake). &lt;span&gt;Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, this combined fear and disgust reaction to intestinal parasites has evolved because they infect us with microscopic larvae meaning we rarely see them with our eyes, yet we are aware they are omnipresent. Once again, as with spiders, we cannot rely only on disgust (and behavioural avoidance) to protect us, and so we also fear unwanted physical contact. The maggot, by contrast, may elicit less fear because it can be seen and avoided more easily.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other details to emerge from the study are that women generally gave higher fear and disgust ratings than men, and especially for non-slimy invertebrates and repulsive human parasites – this may be in line with evolutionary theory because “women as a sex with higher reproductive cost need to be extra careful of pathogens threatening not only their health but also the [health] of their children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the researchers asked their participants about any past traumatic experiences with animals, such as being seriously bitten by a dog or scratched by a cat. Surprisingly perhaps, they found that fear ratings were &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; among people with such a bad experience in their past. However, this correlation makes sense if you consider that people with a greater fear of animals may be be more cautious and less likely to get hurt. “Our results … suggest that fear and disgust could protect subjects against harm even in our modern environment,” the researchers said. In excess, fear can be debilitating and unwelcome, but this last result is perhaps a reminder that it is also there to serve a purpose – including to protect us from the creatures that may bite us while we sleep or infect us from within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing voices that don’t exist in the outside world is the most common form of hallucination experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related conditions and it can be very distressing. However, there is a growing recognition that hearing voices is not always pathological. Many mentally well people hear voices (or “auditory verbal hallucinations”) – in fact, around 6-7 per cent of adults in the general population report having had such experiences at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led some experts to propose a “continuum model” in which the same fundamental underlying mechanism leads to hearing voices in healthy people and in patients with a clinical diagnosis, but that for various reasons, such as a traumatic past, the experience is more troublesome and distressing for the patients. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/45/4/733/5149404&quot;&gt;a new open-access paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; challenges the continuum model, finding an important brain difference between patients who hear voices and voice-hearing healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37393&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Jane Garrison and Iris Sommer, recruited three groups matched for age, education, sex, handedness and overall brain volume: 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related conditions such as nonspecific psychosis or schizoaffective disorder) who hear voices; 50 non-clinical healthy volunteers who hear voices (at least once per week); and 50 healthy controls who do not hear voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers scanned all their participants’ brains, specifically looking at the length of a brain structure involved in “reality monitoring” or telling the difference between internally and externally generated experiences. For instance, a typical test of reality monitoring involves asking a person to read or imagine different words, and then asking them to recall which words they’d read and which they’d imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrison and her colleagues wanted to test the idea that a problem with reality monitoring contributes to the voice-hearing experience in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy people who hear voices. To test this account, they used the scans to measure the length of a brain structure called the paracingulate sulcus (PCS) – this is the most frontal area of the medial prefrontal cortex and previous research has suggested that it is involved in reality monitoring. For instance, people for whom the PCS is completely absent (up to a quarter of the general population by some estimates) tend to struggle with reality monitoring tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they predicted, the researchers found that their patient volunteers had a shorter PCS than the healthy non-voice-hearing controls, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a shorter PCS than the voice-hearing healthy controls. In contrast, there was no (statistically significant) difference in the length of the PCS between the voice-hearing healthy controls and the controls who did not have hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrison’s team believe this result is consistent with there being two routes to auditory hallucinations (see image, above). For healthy people who hear voices, the researchers believe the origin is in hyper-activation of sensory parts of the brain involved in processing auditory information. For patients with schizophrenia, by contrast, they believe there is a sensory component combined with a problem with reality monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings, together with our previous work, corroborate a model in which part of the mechanism underlying hallucinations is shared between clinical and nonclinical individuals with hallucinations,” the researchers said, “while a second mechanism, compromising [in]adequate reality monitoring, is present in patients only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two-route model could explain some of the differences in the voice-hearing experience reported by patients and healthy voice-hearers, such as the lower frequency and shorter duration of the experience in the latter group. In healthy voice-hearers, hyper-activation of sensory areas is likely to be a relatively exceptional event, and their intact reality monitoring can also suppress the experience. For patients, by contrast, hyper-activation of sensory areas may not need to be so intense, and they may not have the necessary reality monitoring capabilities to inhibit or make sense of their hallucinations – consequently their voice hearing is more frequent and long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings also chime with past research that has suggested important differences between clinical and non-clinical voice hearers at a neurobiological level. For instance, patients with schizophrenia have been shown to have heightened synthesis of the brain chemical dopamine, potentially contributing to seeing intense meaning in sensations and experiences (known as “aberrant salience”), whereas non-clinical voice hearers do not show this same abundance of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to note that the new findings – and the two-route model – cannot account for some of the differences in the experiences of patients who hear voices and healthy people who hear voices, such as the more negative (angry, upsetting and controlling) content in the hallucinations reported by patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s worth noting that, among the healthy voice-hearers in this study, the length of the PCS was intermediary between the patients and non-voice-hearing controls. It’s possible, the researchers admitted, that the reason the difference in PCS length between the two healthy groups was found to be statistically non-significant may have been due to a lack of statistical power. They said that replication of this study with larger samples could clarify this issue, adding that “…further research is [also] needed to to assess the extent to which the present results generalise to other nonclinical populations with hallucinations who may have different etiology and phenomenology of hallucinatory experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

Potential role of calcifying nanoparticles in the etiology of multiple sclerosis



Hmm, I thought, this looks interesting. I'd never heard of the idea that nanoparticles could cause neurological illness.



So I read the paper and quickly found myself falling down a (nano)rabbithole into a fascinating and little-known tale of strange science.

&lt;p&gt;There is increasing recognition that while our personality traits are stable enough to shape our lives profoundly, they are also partly malleable, so that our choices and experiences can feedback and influence the kind of people we become. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300825&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt; shines a light on a highly consequential behaviour that captures this dynamic – smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add “… to existing knowledge on the implications of smoking by showing that this behaviour is also likely to alter individuals’ characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37376&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already well established that, by virtue of their traits, some people are more disposed than others to take up smoking – namely those who are more extraverted, less emotionally stable and less conscientious. The new research, led by Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier, suggests (but does not prove) that this habit can then feedback and shape smokers’ traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using repeated measures of people’s personality traits over many years, the researchers report that smokers display personality changes that are different from those seen in non-smokers, especially in terms of reduced emotional stability and reduced extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from five large surveys of middle-aged and older volunteers, four in the US and one in Japan. Ranging in size from just over 600 participants to over 6000, the surveys included information on whether the participants smoked and measures of their personality traits collected repeatedly over time spans from 4 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results showed that smokers showed declines in emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness, relative to non-smokers. However, the precise patterns of change varied across the different samples. The most consistent pattern was for smokers to show relative declines in emotional stability and extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan and his team also looked to see if stopping smoking had any positive personality consequences. In fact, there was little evidence of this. If anything, stopping smoking was associated with declines in agreeableness. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because of a loss of “smoking-related social interactions”; residual adverse effects of smoking; and due to health-related side-effects associated with smoking cessation, such as “heightened risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes” both of which are known to have unhelpful consequences for personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is impressive for the size of the samples and the use of a longitudinal methodology that followed the same people over time. However, it’s limited by the reliance on participants’ self-reports of their own traits; the lack of information on smoking intensity; the skew towards older participants; and it’s inability to offer insights into why smoking would seem to lead to mostly adverse personality changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculated that the health-related harms of smoking might be a factor mediating the habit’s apparent effects on personality. Health consequences of smoking such as insomnia, depression and reduced cardio-vascular fitness are known to have negative effects on personality. “Furthermore,” Stephan’s team add, “smoking may alter the energetic capacities needed to maintain emotional stability, the tendency to be exploratory, cooperative and altruistic, self-disciplined and playful, and enthusiastic and active.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A curious detail in the findings is that, unlike the US samples, differences in personality change were not found among smokers in Japan compared with non-smokers. The researchers said this result may be an extension of what has become known as the “Japanese smoking paradox” – the fact that even though smoking rates are higher in Japan than the US, rates of lung cancer and mortality risk are lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this new research represents “the largest and longest longitudinal examination of the association between smoking and personality change in adulthood,” the researchers said. The results suggest that the “deleterious effects of smoking may extend to detrimental personality changes,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, and as the researchers acknowledge, this conclusion, while highly plausible, comes with a hefty caveat – the observational study design cannot prove that smoking causes personality change. It’s possible that another factor or factors, such as stressful life circumstances, both increase the likelihood of people taking up smoking and cause unwelcome long-term personality changes. It’s also possible that pre-existing personality dispositions drive both the uptake of smoking and the later trajectory of personality change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research that collects more detailed baseline contextual data on participants may be able to test these possibilities. In the meantime, if you are ever tempted to take up smoking, it is worth considering that it is not just your health you are putting at risk, but quite likely also your personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “learning style” myth – the idea that we each have a preferred modality for learning, usually described as visual, auditory or kinaesthetic – just won’t die. Belief in learning styles endures even though psychologists have pointed out repeatedly the many problems with the concept. Students &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/&quot;&gt;don’t benefit from learning in their supposedly preferred style&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and teachers and their pupils &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/&quot;&gt;don’t agree on the pupil’s learning style&lt;/a&gt; in the first place.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But exactly how believers in learning styles conceive of the concept has until now remained unclear. It could be that people take an “essentialist” view that our learning style is something we are born with, for instance. On the other hand, they may believe that learning styles are more liable to change – a “non-essentialist” perspective. A new study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/edu0000366&quot;&gt;the Journal of Educational Psychology&lt;/a&gt; has found that, in fact, both views are common, a result that could have implications for tackling the myth.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37366&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaylene Nancekivell and colleagues at the University of Michigan asked 331 adults who believed in learning styles to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with 15 statements that laid out an essentialist view of the myth. These ranged from suggesting that learning styles are innate (e.g. “In the future, scientists will be able to determine a person’s learning style by examining their genes”) to implying that learning styles can predict success (e.g. “A person’s learning style predicts the kinds of teachers from whom they learn best”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the participants’ responses were quite inconsistent: for example, they tended to agree that learning styles can be detected in childhood, but disagree that they are inherited from their parents. And the average rating for all statements fell almost exactly in the midpoint of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, further analysis revealed two key subgroups hiding in the pool of participants. Based on patterns in their responses, the researchers identified one group they called “essentialisers”, who more strongly endorsed more of the statements, and another group of “non-essentialisers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran a second experiment to find out more about the beliefs of the two groups. Participants read a short story about a baby whose biological and adoptive parents had different learning styles (one set of parents were “visual” learners and the other “kinaesthetic”, for instance). The essentialisers indicated that the child was most likely to develop the learning style of their biological parents, while the non-essentialisers rated the learning style of the adoptive parents higher. Essentialisers were also more likely to believe statements relating learning styles to brain differences, such as “Brain imaging can be used to identify a person’s learning style.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that people’s beliefs about learning styles vary much more than previous studies have recognised, the authors say. Some people appear to believe more strongly than others that learning styles are hard-wired in our brains and genes – and this could potentially make them more resistant to efforts to debunk the myth, the researchers suggest. “The present studies provide a new starting point for research on learning styles and suggest that future research on neuroscience-based myths needs to move beyond merely assessing the rate at which they are endorsed,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be useful to know whether certain individuals are predisposed to being essentialisers, but for now this remains unclear. Neither age, gender nor level of education predicted which participants were in which group. And most dishearteningly, the teachers who took part in this new research were just as likely to take an essentialist view of learning styles as the remaining participants. If essentialist views about learning styles really are more resistant to change, then understanding what makes a person think that way will be important for tackling the myth.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/edu0000366&quot;&gt;Maybe They’re Born With It, or Maybe It’s Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Une petite mise au point concernant le rôle de l’éducation dans les facultés cognitives</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1630</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/une-petite-mise-au-point-concernant-le-role-de-leducation-dans-les-facultes-cognitives/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quelle est la part de l’inné et de l’acquis dans l’intelligence, ou plus généralement dans les facultés cognitives ? C’est une question très controversée, en particulier parce qu’elle a une grande portée politique : l’éducation est-elle importante, ou bien tout est-il prédéterminé par nos gènes ? Il est évident que dans le second cas, investir dans l’éducation semble vain ; il devrait plutôt s’agir de faire de la sélection et de l’orientation que de l’éducation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il existe une littérature scientifique abondante sur ce sujet, malheureusement ses résultats sont souvent mal interprétés et déformés par des idéologues. Prenons l’exemple d’une &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/les-profs-tombent-dans-le-piege-de-l-adn_2083387.html&quot;&gt;récente tribune&lt;/a&gt; de l’essayiste Laurent Alexandre dans l’Express :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;« 64% de nos différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques ; l’école et la famille n’ont malheureusement qu’un rôle marginal face à nos chromosomes ».&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je vais supposer que la première assertion est correcte et bien établie scientifiquement. La conclusion est non seulement fausse, mais absurde. Revenons quelques siècles en arrière. Génétiquement, la population était sensiblement la même qu’aujourd’hui. Mais peu de gens apprenaient à lire, donc peu de gens savaient lire. Par conséquent, oui, l’éducation et la famille ont un rôle déterminant dans les capacités de lecture. Par ailleurs, si l’on avait fait la même étude sur la population de l’époque, on aurait trouvé non pas 64% mais une proportion bien plus faible de déterminisme génétique, puisque les capacités de lecture étaient en premier lieu déterminées par la possibilité d’apprendre à lire. Inversement, si l’éducation était la même pour toute, par exemple si on avait institué une école publique pour tous avec des programmes nationaux strictement appliqués de manière uniforme, eh bien on trouverait que très peu de différences de quoi que ce soit sont expliquées par l’éducation, puisque ce ne serait pas un facteur variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une assertion du type « 64% des différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques » est une mesure contextuelle, qui reflète en grande partie la variabilité de chacun des facteurs. En aucun cas elle n’indique un rôle causal faible pour l’éducation ou l’environnement familial. Elle peut tout aussi bien indiquer une certaine homogénéité de l’éducation reçue. Tout ce qu’elle indique, tout ce qu’indique cette littérature en général, c’est que les facultés cognitives sont influencées par des facteurs à la fois génétiques et environnementaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etant donné que l’on ne sait pas lire spontanément mais uniquement après l’avoir appris, il faut une certaine dose d’aveuglement idéologique pour prétendre que l’école y joue un « rôle marginal ». Certes, il faut aussi avoir un cerveau pour pouvoir lire, d’où les facteurs génétiques. Par exemple, un ver de terre ne sait pas lire. Rien n’indique cependant que ces « 64% » de variation d’origine génétique concernent le cerveau. Il faut aussi des yeux pour pouvoir lire, par exemple. Des difficultés de lecture liés à un problème ophtalmologique d’origine génétique seront comptées dans ce total. De même, si (expérience de pensée) l’éducation des enfants étaient biaisée en fonction de facteurs physiques d’origine génétique, alors ce biais apparaîtrait également comme facteur génétique. Ce n’est sans doute pas ce que l’on veut dire par « facteur génétique des capacités de lecture », mais c’est quand même ce qui est mesuré.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La question qui a un intérêt politique, ce n’est pas : quelle part de la variabilité des capacités de lecture dans un contexte éducatif et socioculturel donné peut être expliqué par des variations génétiques (neurogénétiques ou non, purement biologiques ou conditionnés à des facteurs socioculturels) mais plutôt : dans quelle mesure améliorer l’éducation peut-il améliorer les capacités de lecture ? Pour répondre, on peut faire appel à l’histoire plutôt qu’à la génétique, et la conclusion est sans appel : historiquement, plus de gens ont su lire lorsqu’on leur a enseigné la lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En résumé, oui l’éducation a un rôle majeur dans les capacités cognitives comme la lecture, et la science ne dit pas le contraire. Evidemment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It usually helps to “get a fresh pair of eyes” on a problem, especially from someone with a different perspective than your own. But what if you could find a variety of vantage points from within yourself? After all, each of us has multiple roles and identities in life. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by Sarah Gaither at Duke University presents evidence that prompting children to think about their own multiple identities boosts their problem-solving skills and increases their flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone can be a woman and White, a teacher and a parent, a girl and a friend,” the researchers write. “Although individuals may not automatically reflect on their multiple identities, here we propose that when they do, it may have positive consequences for their creative problem solving and flexible thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37354&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of three studies, Gaither and her team split 48 six- and seven-year-olds into two groups. One was the intervention group and these participants spent time reflecting briefly with a researcher about eight of their various social identities, such as “friend”, “girl” and “reader”. This process concluded with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you are lots of things at the same time.” The other group served as a control and these participants chatted briefly with a researcher about eight of their different physical attributes, such as having two feet and a mouth. Similar to the intervention condition, the control condition ended with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you have a lot of things at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards all the children completed four different problem solving and flexible thinking challenges. One test involved them figuring out how a bear with a bowl of lego could reach honey in a high branch on a tree* (they were told that even stacked together the lego couldn’t reach). Another test involved coming up with novel uses for a gold box. The third involved categorising a collection of photos of 16 individuals in as many ways as possible. The last task involved an interaction with a puppet who made 16 claims about different pairs of items or individuals belonging to the same category, such as a dog and cat being the same kind of animal, or a male and female child being the same kind of person. When the child agreed the puppet was correct, this was taken as a sign of flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent, with the children who reflected on their multiple identities outperforming the children in the control condition on all four of the tests. For instance, half the children in the multiple identities condition solved the bear puzzle, compared with just 12.5 per cent of the control condition children; and the children agreed with the puppets’ broad-minded thinking over six times, on average, compared with under four times on average among the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two follow-up studies with dozens more children, the researchers showed that reflecting on another person’s multiple identities, as opposed to one’s own, did not have the same benefit; and that some of the performance gains associated with thinking about one’s own multiple identities were greater when these were phrased in a way that made them sound a stable part of the self rather than a transient preference – reflecting on being &lt;em&gt;a helper&lt;/em&gt; rather than enjoying helping, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research with adults had already shown benefits to creative thinking of reflecting on one’s own different social identities. This new research builds on those findings by extending them to children, and showing that the benefits are limited to reflecting on one’s own social identities, as opposed to one’s physical attributes, or reflecting on the social identities of others. The new results also jibe with past research showing that travelling abroad and visiting other cultures can increase open-mindedness and creativity. It’s possible that reflecting on one’s own varied social identities helps to activate memories of diverse experiences and perspectives, thus helping trigger more flexible thinking – however, more research is needed to identify the precise mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a short, simple intervention could have such seemingly dramatic effects will likely raise the eyebrows of more sceptical readers. Successful replication attempts with larger samples and diverse participants may help alleviate these doubts. Future research could also look into whether the multiple identities intervention would have greater benefits for individuals with more diverse social roles and experiences (for children raised in multicultural or multi-racial homes, for instance), and whether reflecting on social roles that one perceives negatively would still be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our discovery suggests that anyone–regardless of their racial group or other social identification–may benefit from a multifaceted mindset,” the researchers said. “Something as simple as thinking about one’s identity from multiple angles could increase open-mindedness in a society that is becoming increasingly diverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871&quot;&gt;Thinking about multiple identities boosts children’s flexible thinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The answer is by emptying the bowl, inverting it and using it as a step to stand on and reach higher.&lt;/p&gt;

Through the partnership, Science Exchange and Brex can provide their mutual biotech and pharma clients with streamlined access to payments and innovative R&amp;amp;D services, thereby accelerating drug discovery research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Having attained a $2.6B valuation in just over 2 years, Brex has demonstrated a market need by solving a major challenge for entrepreneurs — simple, high quality payments products that allow them access to their credit. This week, Brex launched its corporate credit card for life sciences, freeing R&amp;amp;D leaders from the personal liability embedded within existing credit card offerings. The Brex for Life Science Card provides up to 20x higher credit limits, tailored rewards (such as points multipliers on lab supplies and conference fees), and discounts on outsourced R&amp;amp;D services ordered through Science Exchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“We are excited to help increase our clients’ buying power by offering them access to the Brex for Life Science Card,” said Elizabeth Iorns, PhD, CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder of Science Exchange. A former cancer researcher, Dr. Iorns once had to use her own credit card to fund a study and personally understands the potential impact of the Brex card on scientific research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“With Science Exchange, we will continue to explore ways to jointly serve our clients through integration of new payment technologies,” said Orion Despo, Head of Growth and GM Life Sciences at Brex. “Combining Science Exchange’s project tracking capabilities with the Brex platform’s automated expense management, life science entrepreneurs can spend less time on audit trails and more time on research.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Brex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Brex is transforming B2B payments by creating corporate cards, rewards, and travel programs that are tailored to specific industries. In 2018 Brex launched the first corporate card and rewards program specifically designed for startups. By rebuilding the credit card tech stack from the ground up, Brex is able to reimagine every aspect of corporate cards, including underwriting, transparency and approvals, to create a radically better experience for customers. Brex is backed by Y Combinator Continuity, Max Levchin, and more and has raised $315M in equity and $100M in debt capital. The company’s headquarters are in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>The Neurocritic: 'I Do Not Exist' - Pathological Loss of Self after a Buddhist Retreat</title>

All you see is a shell with no being inside, a mask covering nothingness. I am no one and no thing. I am the unborn, the non-existent.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;– from &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10943-019-00794-x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pickering (2019)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therapytribe.com/listing/dr-judith-pickering-marriage-and-family-therapist-camperdown-new-south-wales-australia-2050/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Judith Pickering&lt;/a&gt; is a psychotherapist and Jungian Analyst in Sydney, Australia. Her patient ‘Eve’ is an “anonymous, fictionalised amalgam of patients suffering disorders of self.”   Eve had a psychotic episode while attending a Tibetan  Buddhist retreat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“She felt that she was no more than an amoeba-like semblance of pre-life  with no form, no substance, no past, no future, no sense of on-going  being.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2ereq31Zfg/XQai7NjZLZI/AAAAAAAAM3A/w6h_6TZWufw7LUZIaWO5-AfVU8bjaIUiQCLcBGAs/s1600/Naegleria%2Bfowleri_brain-eating%2Bamoeba2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;507&quot; data-original-width=&quot;710&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2ereq31Zfg/XQai7NjZLZI/AAAAAAAAM3A/w6h_6TZWufw7LUZIaWO5-AfVU8bjaIUiQCLcBGAs/s400/Naegleria%2Bfowleri_brain-eating%2Bamoeba2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve's fractured sense of self preceded the retreat. In fact, she was drawn to Buddhist philosophy precisely &lt;i&gt;because &lt;/i&gt;of its negation of self. In the doctrine of non-being (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;anātman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;),  “there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul, or essence in living beings.” The tenet of emptiness (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;śūnyatā&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that “all things are empty [or void] of intrinsic existence”  &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was problematic as well. When applied and interpreted incorrectly, &lt;i&gt;śūnyatā&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;anātman &lt;/i&gt;can resemble or precipitate disorders of the self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Pickering noted: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Eve’ is representative of a number of patients suffering both &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;derealisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;depersonalisation&lt;/a&gt;. They doubt the existence of the outer world (derealisation) and fear that they do not exist. In place of a sense of self, they have but an empty core inside (depersonalisation).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you find your way back to your &lt;i&gt;self&lt;/i&gt; after that? Will the psychotic episode respond to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuroleptics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mood stabilizers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current article takes a decidedly different approach from this blog's usual themes of neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopharmacology. Spirituality, dreams, and the unconscious play an important role in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jungian psychology&lt;/a&gt;. Pickering mentions the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.sonoma.edu/users/d/daniels/objectrelations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Object Relations School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Attachment Theory&lt;/a&gt;, Field Theory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190126041446/http://www.therelationalschool.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Relational School&lt;/a&gt;, the Conversational Model, Intersubjectivity Theory and Infant Research. She cites &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;development, Object Relations Theory&quot;&gt;Winnicott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bowlby&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;attachment theory&quot;&gt;Bowlby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Bion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an influential British psychoanalyst&quot;&gt;Bion&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href=&quot;http://nro.sagepub.com/content/11/1/16.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blanke &amp;amp; Arzy 2005&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kas et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Seth et al. 2012&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I read this paper? Sometimes it's useful to consider the value of alternate perspectives. Now we can examine the potential hazards of teaching overly Westernized conceptions of Buddhist philosophy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When Westerners Attend Large Buddhist Retreats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Eve’s existential predicament exemplifies a more general area of concern found in situations involving Western practitioners of Buddhism, whether in traditional settings in Asia, or Western settings ostensibly adapted to the Western mind. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have there been problems of translation in regard to Buddhist teachings on &lt;i&gt;anātman&lt;/i&gt; (non-self) as implying the self is completely non-existent, and interpretations &lt;i&gt;of śūnyatā &lt;/i&gt;(emptiness) as meaning all reality is non-existent, or void?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This relates to another issue concerning situations where Westerners attend large Buddhist retreats in which personalised psycho-spiritual care may be lacking. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Traditionally, a Buddhist master would know the student well and carefully select appropriate teachings and practices according to a disciple’s psychological, physical and spiritual predispositions, proficiency and maturity. For example, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;teaching emptiness or &lt;i&gt;śūnyatā &lt;/i&gt;to someone who is not ready can be extremely harmful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As well as being detrimental for the student, it puts the teacher at risk of a major ethical infringement... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Dr. Pickering's discussion of &lt;b&gt;Nameless Dread&lt;/b&gt; to be especially compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX984nkwjy8/XQbNwj3jHzI/AAAAAAAAM3k/tN7WwofDiZwAFhfoftrG9-chG895xvi_QCLcBGAs/s1600/mask.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;400&quot; data-original-width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX984nkwjy8/XQbNwj3jHzI/AAAAAAAAM3k/tN7WwofDiZwAFhfoftrG9-chG895xvi_QCLcBGAs/s320/mask.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nameless Dread&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I open the door to a white, frozen mask. I know immediately that Eve has disappeared again into what she calls ‘the void’. She sits down like an automaton, stares in stony silence at the wall as if staring into space. I do not exist for her, she is totally isolated in her own realm of non-existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sense of deadly despair pervades the room. I feel myself fading into nothingness, this realm of absence, unmitigated, bleakness and blankness.We sit in silence, sometimes for session after session. I wonder what on earth do I have to offer her? Nothing, it seems.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g5IHL-n3G5M/XQbDk5M-0JI/AAAAAAAAM3Y/uNxNbNZG7uIYvQCSjy6svDqR_Nr8YolvgCLcBGAs/s1600/sadness4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;480&quot; data-original-width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g5IHL-n3G5M/XQbDk5M-0JI/AAAAAAAAM3Y/uNxNbNZG7uIYvQCSjy6svDqR_Nr8YolvgCLcBGAs/s320/sadness4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDENDUM (June 18 2019): &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/i-do-not-exist-pathological-loss-of.html#c1481186127380413356&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/a&gt; alerted me to a tragic story two years ago in Pennsylvania, where a young woman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/06/york_county_suicide_megan_vogt.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'She didn't know what was real': Did 10-day meditation retreat trigger woman's suicide?&quot;&gt;ultimately died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; after experiencing a psychotic episode during an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;intensive 10-day meditation retreat.

&lt;p&gt;Loneliness &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;is a “disease”&lt;/a&gt;, associated with an increased risk of death equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Strides have been made in understanding what &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/&quot;&gt;form of loneliness&lt;/a&gt; is damaging&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(a lack of&lt;i&gt; close&lt;/i&gt; relationships with other people, rather than a lack of relationships per se), but ways to tackle loneliness are badly needed. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, available as a preprint on PsyArXiv, reveals a way in which loneliness seems to be maintained and, therefore, a potential route to an intervention.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37348&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular model of loneliness holds that it is maintained by abnormal processing of the social signals – such as smiles and eye contact – that underlie positive social interactions. One consequence of this abnormal processing could be a failure to automatically mimic other people’s facial expressions – a phenomenon that occurs naturally during most social interactions. To investigate for the first time whether this is the case, Andrew Arnold and Piotr Winkielman at the University of California, San Diego conducted a small, preliminary study on 35 student volunteers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students first completed three scales that measured their loneliness, depression and personality. Based on the loneliness results, they were classed as either lonely or not lonely. Next they had electrodes attached to two pairs of their own facial muscles important for generating emotional expressions – regions of the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles in the cheeks, and also the corrugator supercilii (frowning) muscles in the brow. They were then shown video clips of men and women making facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scales that they were given to complete showed that the lonely and non-lonely students were equally good at distinguishing between facial expressions, and there were no group differences in the strength of “negative emotion” ratings to anger, fear and sadness or “positive” ratings to joy. So the lonely people could recognise and understand emotional expressions just as well as the non-lonely group. However, there were important differences in how their &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; faces responded spontaneously to the video clips.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When members of both groups saw videos of people displaying anger, for example, their own brows moved to automatically mimic this expression. But when the expression in the video was of joy, only the “non-lonely” group automatically smiled in response. The participants’ scores on depression and on extraversion bore no relation to this finding. It was loneliness that made the difference.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers checked that the lonely group could deliberately mimic smiles, as well as frowns (which they could). They also found that the lonely group smiled automatically while viewing “non-social” positive images (such as nature scenes) that also made the other group smile. These images didn’t include people (or if they did, their facial expressions weren’t obvious.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a failure to mimic other people’s smiles automatically could be playing a role in loneliness. A failure to mimic a smile might send an antisocial signal to others, the researchers note, undermining social connections, and leading to social &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;connect. “Indeed, this could be one behavioural mechanism that maintains chronic loneliness,” they add.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small study, and it can’t speak to the causal direction: does loneliness lead to a problem with smile mimicry or is it the other way around? But it does suggest a new target for addressing loneliness, and for further research into the role it might potentially play in real-world encounters.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the serious problem of loneliness in society and its danger to health, more research on how it presents in everyday social interactions is useful for greater understanding of and treatment of the condition, ourselves and each other,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/&quot;&gt;Smile (but only deliberately) though your heart is aching: Loneliness is associated with impaired spontaneous smile mimicry&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has yet to be subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version on which this report was based]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: We get happier as we get older. (Part 2 of Your Brain at 100)</title>

	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/we-get-happier-as-we-get-older-part-2-of-your-brain-at-100/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5968&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/close-up-dungaree-elder-2050981-300x249.jpg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 2 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;those years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another longevity project, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/&quot;&gt;New England Centenarian Study&lt;/a&gt; (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of their age, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older you get the happier you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The emotion paradox in the aging brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

This responsibility, once the domain of a company’s IT function, must be shared by all teams within organizations; scientific leadership, operations, legal and finance teams can all help mitigate risks of outsourced R&amp;amp;D services management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five key factors make the shared responsibility necessary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distributed, networked R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; R&amp;amp;D studies are increasingly distributed across geographies, across multiple third party providers and subcontractors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large, electronically shared data sets. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data are being stored on multiple cloud-based platforms and transmitted electronically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public awareness. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While data disclosure events receive the most attention (because companies must publicly disclose data breaches), there is increased public awareness around other cyberattacks, such as ransomware attacks, phishing, and intellectual property theft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;High dollar amounts of losses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; incurred following cyberattacks, with increasingly sophisticated and destructive attacks. The NotPetya malware attack of 2018, which affected at least one major pharma company, cost companies over $10 billion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More oversight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Given the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule, Congress has asked that companies who have suffered data breaches share details around which third-party providers they use and what security measures are in place. Likewise, in Europe, 91 companies have been fined for lapses in data privacy since the GDPR data privacy regulation took effect in May 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why media outlets report scientifically misleading information. But one key site at which this sort of misunderstanding takes root is in the press releases that universities issue when one of their researchers has published something that has a chance of garnering some attention. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1324-7&quot;&gt;new open-access study in BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt; attempts to change this by intervening in the process directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37345&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press releases are often misleading in many different ways, but a common flaw is their &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/21/how-much-are-readers-misled-by-headlines-that-imply-correlational-findings-are-causal/&quot;&gt;tendency to confuse causal and correlational claims&lt;/a&gt;. That is, an observational study will find that (to take a hypothetical), the more wine people drink, the more likely they are to be diagnosed with cancer over a given period. A study like this, reported accurately, doesn’t show that drinking wine &lt;i&gt;causes&lt;/i&gt; cancer – it shows that wine consumption is &lt;i&gt;associated with &lt;/i&gt;cancer diagnoses. It could be some other factor or factors is/are responsible for the link, like maybe people who drink more wine engage in other behaviours that &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; increase the risk of cancer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental studies, on the other hand, allow for the more confident drawing of causal inferences. If (again hypothetically) you took two otherwise equivalent groups, assigned one to make no lifestyle changes other than beginning to drink more wine, and then tracked differences in long-term cancer diagnoses, it’s more likely any observed group differences were caused by the experimental intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that health press releases often present purely correlational evidence as though it is causal is, to an extent, understandable: “Wine Causes Cancer” is more eye-catching than “Researchers Uncover A Correlation Between Wine Consumption And Cancer That May Or May Not Be Causal.” And because journalists often write stories based entirely on press releases, the end result is that news coverage often lacks nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new research, a team of psychologists led by Rachel Adams at Cardiff University and including her colleague Christopher Chambers, the author of “The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology: A Manifesto for Reforming the Culture of Scientific Practice”, asked a bunch of university press offices to participate. The press offices sent the team hundreds of their biomedical and health-related press releases before they went out to the public, and Chambers and his colleagues randomly assigned them to different conditions: some they didn’t touch regardless of their contents or accuracy (the control group), whereas for the others they proposed edits that “aligned” the press release’s headline and content with the nature of the evidence (with experimental evidence allowing for stronger causal claims, and purely correlational evidence presented with cautious language). Then they watched the press releases go into the wild, evaluating how often their more careful approach was carried over into any ensuing national and international press stories – and whether the toned down releases led to less media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important takeaways are that news headlines were more accurate when they were written off more accurate press releases (which shows that journalists really are relying heavily on press releases rather than reading the studies themselves). And as judged by the amount of media coverage each press release generated, there was “no evidence of reduced news uptake for press releases whose headlines and main claims aligned to evidence.” Now, press releases should be accurate for accuracy’s own sake, but this does offer some evidence that honest press-release writers won’t be punished, in terms of reduced media coverage, by doing the right thing. This suggests, as Chambers and his team write in their abstract, that “[c]autious claims and explicit caveats about correlational findings may penetrate into news without harming news interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the research team further point out, what this study can’t answer is the actual effect of misleading versus appropriately hedged media coverage on news consumers themselves – that is, will their behaviour change on the basis of whether or not they are reading accurate health coverage? That’s a question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be fascinating and important to conduct a study like this on press releases related to psychological findings – another area where it’s been fairly standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2015/08/tetris-related-science-reporting-failure.html&quot;&gt;for a while&lt;/a&gt; for weak or conflicting findings to be presented in a much stronger, more attention-getting manner in press releases, potentially causing harm to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: When does old age begin? (Part 1 of Your Brain at 100 series)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5957&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smartphone-1987212_1920-300x128.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 1 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When does old age begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t seem to make up our minds, and the older we get, the further we move the goalposts marking the last season of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/06/29/growing-old-in-america-expectations-vs-reality/&quot;&gt;2009 survey&lt;/a&gt; of Americans asked participants when they believed someone grew ‘old’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young folks in their twenties believed said old age began at 60. Those under 50 put the threshold closer to 70, whereas those 65 and above said that the average person does not become old until turning 74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting old wasn’t nearly as bad as people think it will be. Nor was it quite as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, one in four adults ages 65 surveyed reported memory loss. One in five had a serious illness, are no longer sexually active, or often feel sad or depressed, lonely or have trouble paying bills. One in ten felt like a burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside, the same group said they have more time for hobbies, travel, volunteer work, and more financial security. Of all the good things about getting old, the best by far, according to older adults, is being able to spend more time with family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Am I Old? Certainly not!”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my boys said to me recently he couldn’t imagine me as a little girl and how did it feel to finally be “old”. I told him I feel the same now as I did when I was 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Am I Old? Certainly not!” This was the answer survey respondents gave too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the older they got, the younger they said they feel. About half of those under 30 said they felt their age. But those who were 75 and older? Just 35% say they feel “old”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems we remain on intimate terms with our much younger selves — I sometimes wonder how ten-year old me suddenly became forty-three?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We enter the end of our lifespan with our past woven intimately into our biology.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From birth, our neural architecture is shaped by life’s ups and downs, the decisions we made, the places where we lived, worked and learned, the meaning we’ve derived, and who we loved, gave life to, and travelled with through time. How we spend our early years will determine how we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more of us are living to into old age, and there has never been a better time in which to do so. Our large clever human brains have bequeathed us with modern medicine and tools with which we manage our reproductive health, avoid maternal and neonatal death, vaccinate against disease, prevent pain, treat infection and some cancers, and perform surgery if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, women lived barely long enough to see out their 50s. A baby girl born today can expect to live to see out the first decades of the 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncovering the secrets of exceptional longevity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 21, 1875, one year before the Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, cinema, and on a trip to Paris saw the Eiffel tower being built. When she was 13, Jeanne met Vincent Van Gogh; although apparently, she was less than impressed saying he was ”…very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf, and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and “alert as a hummingbird” till the end. The French called her “la doyenne de l’humanitè” (the elder of humankind) and she still holds &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11520-2_16&quot;&gt;the record&lt;/a&gt; for the world’s longest ever living human (although this has been recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/&quot;&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2017, the latest longevity record holder, Emma Martina Luigia Morano of Vercelli, Italy, died aged 117. Born in November 1899, Morano was the last known living person who was born in the 1800s. According to the Guinness Book of Records, Morano followed the same extraordinary diet for around 90 years: three eggs per day (two raw, one cooked), fresh Italian pasta, and a dish of raw meat. The current longevity crown belongs to Polish Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal, who celebrated his 113th birthday in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Once rare as diamonds, the oldest of the old are the fastest growing sector of our global population.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were born in 1900, the odds of living till age 100 were less than 1 in a million, and few people lived long enough see out the 1950s. For girls born into wealthy countries today, the odds of blowing out 100 candles on a cake are roughly 1 in 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel Kristal claims he doesn’t know the secret of his long life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that everything is determined from above and we shall never know the reasons why. There have been smarter, stronger and better-looking men then me who are no longer alive. All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked her secrets, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that … I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes. Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work, raw eggs, biking, and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wait. For death and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blue Zones lessons for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another longevity project, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner together Professor Michel Poulain famously described five ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluezones.com/&quot;&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;’ around the globe where the residents live to exceptional old age. Despite being very different parts of the world, there are commonalities to the resident’s lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their longevity has nothing to do with brute discipline, diets, exercise programs or supplements… In Blue Zones areas around the world, longevity happens to people. It’s the result of the right environment that constantly nudges them into moving more, eating more plants and beans while eating less meat and sugar, socializing with the right people and living out their values. It’s that simple, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residents of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, prioritise friendship and family, and they almost never work extra hours if it means they have to forego a good party. They also foster ‘plan de vida’ or ‘a reason to live’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Loma Linda, California, the strong sense of purpose, day of rest, no-smoking policy, and healthy diet practices of the local Seventh Day Adventist community has rubbed off on the health of the whole town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residents of the mountainous villages of Sardinia, Italy and the Greek island of Ikaria, nap, fast, grow their own food, and drink wine daily with friends. It’s thought the clean air, warm breezes and rugged terrain of the Mediterranean islands draw locals outdoors to move naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The residents of the Japanese islands of Okinawa, home to the world’s longest living women, are dedicated to family. Okinawans practice ‘Hara hachi bu’, a reminder to stop eating when they’re 80% full, ‘Ikigai’, which roughly translates to “Why I wake up in the morning,” and form ‘Moais’, groups of five friends that remain committed to each other for live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buettner has distilled the lifestyle practices of Blue Zones into lessons for longevity. As he says, to make it to 100 you may have to “win the genetic lottery”, but the average person’s life expectancy can be increased by moving move, prioritising friends, family and social gatherings, eating less, drinking wine, and fostering a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sydney Centenarian Study lessons for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the rarity of extremely old folks, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/research-projects/sydney-centenarian-study&quot;&gt;Sydney Centenarian Study&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with a consortium of centenarian research teams from around the globe to pool their resources and data to enable more powerful conclusions to be drawn. Their data support the Blue Zones observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlene Levitan, who once headed up the Sydney Centenarian Study says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is emerging from the global research is that around 30% of longevity is contributed by genetics. The remaining 70% is to do with our lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, exercise, and remaining socially integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest themes to emerge is related to the personality traits of resilience, adaptability and optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of our centenarians will report optimism as a life-long personality characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have healthy vision, there will be a specific region of your brain (in the visual cortex) that responds most strongly whenever you look at faces, and similar regions that are especially responsive to the sight of words or natural scenes. What’s more, in any two people, these face, word and scene regions are located in pretty much the same spot in the brain. However, there is not a specific region for every possible category of visible stimulus – there are no “car” or “shoe” regions, for example (at least, not that have been identified to date). Is that because childhood experience is critical for training the visual cortex – we spend a lot of time looking at faces, say, but not cars? And, if so, in theory, could a lot of childhood time spent looking at a different type of object generate its own dedicated, individual category region?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is “yes”, at least according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8&quot;&gt;ingenious study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour, &lt;/i&gt;of people who played a Pokémon game for years of their childhood.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37328&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Gomez led the new study while a graduate student at Stanford University. He was looking for a way to test whether there’s a critical developmental window for the formation of dedicated category regions in the human visual cortex, just as there is in macaque monkeys. He needed a kind of visual stimulus that some adults had been exposed to intensively in childhood but others had not. He thought of how, from about the age of six, he, like many other kids he knew, used to spend countless hours playing a game on his Nintendo Game Boy called Pokémon Red and Blue. It involved identifying hundreds of different Pokémon characters, which look a bit like animals or mythical beasts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez realised that if he could find other people who had also started playing the game intensively at about the same age, using the same device, he could explore whether this had influenced the organisation of their visual cortex.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He managed to recruit 11 such adults (including himself), and scanned their brains while they were shown images of Pokémon characters, as well as other things, such as faces, corridors and cartoons. Gomez and his colleagues found that within the visual cortex (in the ventral temporal region) of the Pokémon experts, there was a discrete area that was most active when looking at the Pokémon characters. There was no such region in a control group of non-players.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other work has found that the brains of people who become experts at recognising a type of object (like cars) as an adult respond differently to those objects than the brains of novices. But these differences are not in the visual cortex; they’re more often in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attention and decision-making rather than basic visual processing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the work showing the plasticity of the visual cortex in young macaques, “the current finding of a Pokémon-preferring brain region really drives home just how amazing the plasticity of our developing visual system is,” write Daniel Janini and Talia Konkle of Harvard University in a news comment on the paper, published in the same issue.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez and his colleagues also found that – as with face-processing or word-processing regions – the “Pokemon region” shared a similar location in all of the experts’ brains. They think that the physical size of an object’s image on the retina is important in determining where, in the brain, the category region forms. The image size of a Pokémon character viewed on an old Game Boy screen by children is consistently smaller than that of someone’s face – and a lot smaller than that of a landscape, for instance – which could have a lasting effect on the way visual representations are handled in the adult brain, the researchers think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as being fascinating, the study has potentially important practical implications. “Our data raise the possibility that if people do not share common visual experiences of a stimulus during childhood, either from disease, as is the case in cataracts, or cultural differences in viewing patterns, then an atypical or unique representation of that stimulus may result in adulthood, which has important implications for learning disabilities and social disabilities,” the researchers write. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider autism, for example, which is associated with difficulties recognising faces and an aversion to eye contact. If kids with autism grow up looking at faces differently from how most children do, perhaps this explains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurosciencenews.com/ffa-fusiform-facial-area-neurons-autism-recognition/&quot;&gt;observed deficits&lt;/a&gt; in the function of the face-sensitive region of their visual cortex, and in turn this could contribute to the social difficulties that autistic children experience. If this account is correct, then finding out how long the window of visual cortical plasticity lasts will be critical for designing effective interventions for autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8&quot;&gt;Extensive childhood experience with Pokémon suggests eccentricity drives organization of visual cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;How brains learn diseases, and their cures&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/1*slNjzwmTKuHo03_bW86V-Q.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are &lt;em&gt;cells&lt;/em&gt;, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-to-unlearn-a-disease&quot;&gt;epileptic patients report&lt;/a&gt; that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-dostoevsky-epilepsy-was-a-matter-of-both-life-and-literature&quot;&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012372&quot;&gt;Rivlin et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517513/&quot;&gt;Giaccia, Simon, &amp;amp; Johnson, 2004&lt;/a&gt;). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705794&quot;&gt;Kemp &amp;amp; Peers, 2007&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615&quot;&gt;Ling et al., 2001&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728482/&quot;&gt;Nei, 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821532/&quot;&gt;Richerson, 2010&lt;/a&gt;). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11438615&quot;&gt;Ling et al., 2001&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15897710&quot;&gt;P-Codrea, et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468748&quot;&gt;Takano et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123&quot;&gt;So, 2008&lt;/a&gt;), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, SUDEP is more prevalent among males, and males tend to be more sensitive to hypoxia, suffering worse outcomes. This has been found true both in clinical studies and in studies involving multiple animal models (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474588&quot;&gt;Hill &amp;amp; Fitch, 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542909&quot;&gt;Mayoral, Omar, &amp;amp; Penn, 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889641&quot;&gt;Mirza, 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149081&quot;&gt;Pérez-Crespo et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;). This sexual dimorphism may be due, in part, to the gene G6PD, an X-linked gene related to oxidative stress, which has been implicated in hypoxia-induced damage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063801&quot;&gt;Chettimada et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225644&quot;&gt;Gao, L., et al., 2004&lt;/a&gt;). It’s also worth noting that in a rodent model, sleep apnea-induced plasticity of the breathing circuit was normalized with antioxidant treatment, which may similarly show a protective effect in high SUDEP risk patients. Therefore, markers of oxidative stress may play an important role in detecting and preventing SUDEP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some researchers believe that SUDEP is related to another medical mystery, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the best known risk factors for SIDS is prenatal nicotine exposure, and nicotine exposure is known to alter receptor expression in oxygen-sensing neural circuits; therefore both diseases may result from plasticity of the brain areas responsible for controlling breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SUDEP has also been associated with a variety of genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as well as several anti-convulsive drugs that also make patients prone to arrhythmias (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372310&quot;&gt;Klassen et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989471/&quot;&gt;Glasscock, 2014&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087123&quot;&gt;So, 2008&lt;/a&gt;). However, genes do not deterministically dictate SUDEP risk. Given that genetic tests are costly, and only suggestive of susceptibility, a functional measurement such as apnea would likely be a more effective biomarker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=ced1cb1b3545&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/thoughts-on-a-medical-mystery-ced1cb1b3545&quot;&gt;Thoughts on a medical mystery&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You should take just under two-and-a-half minutes to finish reading this blog post. That’s going by the findings of a new review, which has looked at almost 200 studies of reading rates published over the past century to come up with an overall estimate for how quickly we read. And it turns out that that rate is considerably slower than commonly thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the various estimates of average reading speed bandied around over the years, one of the most commonly cited is 300 words per minute (wpm). However, a number of findings of slower reading rates challenge that statistic, notes Marc Brysbaert from Ghent University in Belgium in his new paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/&quot;&gt;released as a preprint on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37321&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brysbaert searched for all studies measuring reading rates in participants aged between 17 and 60 and in languages that use the Latin alphabet. The exact nature of the studies varied a lot: for example, in some, participants had to read a long passage before answering multiple choice questions about the text, while in others they read single sentences while their eye movements were measured. But Brysbaert included only those studies in which participants read for fun or comprehension, and excluded others that require memorization or other challenges. Altogether, he found 190 suitable studies conducted between 1901 and 2019, collectively involving 17,887 participants.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average reading rate across all these studies turned out to be just 238 wpm – much slower than the popular 300 wpm estimate. However, there was quite a lot of variability between studies, particularly those that used very short passages, where the slowest rate was just over 100 wpm and the fastest nearly 400 wpm. With longer texts, the rates fell more closely around the average, suggesting that longer reading tasks might be a more reliable measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the number of studies involving non-English languages was too small to draw any firm conclusions, there seemed to be a hint of differences between languages. For example, reading rate in the five Spanish studies was considerably faster than the average, at 278 wpm, while the average rate for the 144 English-only studies was 236 wpm. And while the meta-analysis only included participants under the age of 60, Brysbaert notes that other studies have found that reading rate declines in older age groups.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that reading rates are closer to 240 than 300 wpm might seem fairly inconsequential. But it does have real-world implications. These kinds of thresholds are used by educators to determine whether someone is a slow reader and in need of remedial help – so honing in on a precise number is important. “Setting the target reading rate at 300 wpm is unrealistic for the majority of people and likely to result in disappointment of what can be achieved,” writes Brysbaert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis of past reading-rate estimates is arguably the most interesting part of the new preprint – but in fact the manuscript encompasses a lot more. If you want to find out more about the long history of reading research&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;or what the fastest possible reading speed is, go and have a look at the paper. But set aside some time: at more than 19,000 words long, it will take you about 80 minutes to get through.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture in your mind a futuristic, technologically enhanced human. Perhaps you imagined them with a subcutaneous device in their arm for phone calls and browsing the internet. Maybe they are wearing smart glasses for augmented reality. What I’d wager you didn’t think of is the presence of an artificial sixth digit attached to each hand. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10306-w&quot;&gt;a breakthrough open-access study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the first to study the physiology and sensorimotor mechanics of polydactyly volunteers (people born with extra fingers) – shows the feasibility and practical advantages that would be gained from such an extra appendage. The results also have implications for the medical treatment of polydactyl people, who often have their extra finger removed at birth on the presumption that it will be of no benefit to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37317&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carsten Mehring and his colleagues conducted various tests with two polydactyly volunteers, a 17-year-old boy and his mother, both born with an extra fully formed finger between their thumb and index finger (known as preaxial polydactyly). The researchers note that polydactyly is “not rare”, with an incidence of around 0.2 per cent in the population. However, fully formed preaxial polydactyly is a rarer subset of that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using MRI of the volunteers’ hands, the researchers established that the extra finger has a saddle joint, similar to a typical thumb, and that it is innervated by its own dedicated nerves. Further tests established that the volunteers had independent control of their extra finger and that they were able to use it to perform a pinch grip with each of their other fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MRI of the volunteers’ brains further showed that the extra finger was represented in the brain independently of the other fingers. Another test, that involved concealing the extra finger and asking the volunteers’ to identify landmarks on it, showed that they had an accurate mental representation of their extra digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers used video motion capture to observe the volunteers manipulating various objects. This showed that the volunteers engaged in a “rich ensemble of movement patterns” and that they frequently used their extra finger in coordination with both their thumb and index finger (it was not simply used as a substitute for these digits). “Taken together these results demonstrate that the movements of the six fingers of our two subjects had increased complexity relative to common five-fingered hands,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do these extra movement capabilities provide any functional advantage? Mehring and his team devised a video game that required coordinating key presses to respond to six boxes oscillating progressively faster up and down onscreen. A different key press was required to respond to each of the six boxes, so people with normal five-fingered hands would need two hands to succeed at the task, the researchers note. Critically, the polydactyl volunteers were able to achieve the same impressive game performance with one hand as with two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience and psychology have studied extensively the profound neural consequences for humans of losing a limb or other appendage, including documenting the pain caused by the phantom limb effect (usually explained as due to reorganisation of the brain’s representation of missing part). However, this new study represents the first neuroscientific exploration of having an extra body part, finding “… that the human nervous system is able to develop, embody and control multiple extra degrees of freedom and integrate them into coordinated movements with the other limbs, without any apparent deficits or conflicts in the sensorimotor or mental representations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has immediate implications for the medical response to polydactyl, suggesting the need to “…thoroughly evaluate the functionality of [the extra digit] in polydactyl infants before deciding whether to remove it.” Also, from a cyborg perspective, the results “…suggest that it may be of value to augment normal five-fingered hands with an artificial supernumerary finger,” the researchers said. In fact this new research paves the wave for an entire new research endeavor. “Polydactyl individuals with functional [extra fingers] offer a unique opportunity to investigate the neural control of supernumerary limbs, analyse internal representations of body and the limits of sensorimotor capabilities in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10306-w&quot;&gt;Augmented manipulation ability in humans with six-fingered hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: When narcolepsy makes you more creative</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=141992</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/602950398/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At night, the surrealist poet Saint-Pol-Roux used to hang a sign on his bedroom’s door that read: “Do not disturb: poet at work.” Indeed, may sleep increase our creativity? The link between creativity and sleep has been a topic of intense speculation, mainly based on anecdotal reports of artistic and scientific discoveries people have made while dreaming. Dmitri Mendeleev supposedly came up with the arrangement that became the periodic table while asleep. Yet, scientific proof of such a relationship remains scarce. To investigate the long-term effect of sleep on creativity, clinicians and scientists from Sorbonne University, Paris, France, and Bologna University, Italy, called upon experts of sleep and dreams: patients with narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder characterised by uncontrolled sleep attacks. These naps are special, as they often start immediately with a specific sleep stage named rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas healthy subjects need to sleep for roughly one hour before entering REM sleep. Therefore, patients with narcolepsy have a swift access to REM sleep, a stage associated with robust dreaming activity. They also present many symptoms showing that the boundary between wakefulness and REM sleep is blurry. For example, most narcolepsy patients are lucid dreamers, meaning that they are conscious of dreaming while dreaming, to the point of sometimes having control over their dreams. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130&quot;&gt;It has also been shown that naps containing REM sleep are followed by a period of increased mental flexibility, in turn favouring problem solving&lt;/a&gt;. Given their life-long privileged access to REM sleep and dreams, may patients with narcolepsy have developed over time higher creative abilities than average?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awz137&quot;&gt;To answer this question, the authors compared the creative abilities of patients with narcolepsy with healthy subjects&lt;/a&gt;. Defining and measuring creativity is not an easy task. In this research field, creativity is commonly defined as the ability to produce work that is both original and adapted to constraints. In order to obtain a picture of creativity as detailed and complete as possible, the authors asked participants to complete various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, 185 patients with narcolepsy and 126 healthy subjects completed two questionnaires on creativity. The first questionnaire explores your creative profile and score, through 57 questions, and concludes whether one is innovative, imaginative, or a researcher.  Then, in the second questionnaire subjects report creative achievements (from being a complete beginner to being a national star) in various domains of arts and sciences, including writing, theatre/film, humour, inventions, or culinary arts. The results of these two questionnaires provide a subjective measure of creativity. Next, researchers tested the creative performances of 30 patients with narcolepsy and 30 healthy subjects during a face-to-face two-hour long test of creativity, named the Evaluation of Creative Potential. The divergent-exploratory thinking, a thought process used to generate creative ideas, was tested by finding the greatest number of solutions to a problem (e.g., “Invent the maximum of shapes using two triangles”). The convergent-integrative thinking, the ability to give the correct answer to questions that do not require significant creativity, was tested by combing several elements into a coherent pattern (e.g., drawings a scene based on seven shapes, or writing a story that includes an animal, an old man, the suburb and three cars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher creative scores than the healthy subjects, for both the subjective and the objective measures, and in all forms of creative profiles. Most symptoms of narcolepsy (sleepiness, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, but not treatments) were also associated with higher scores of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased creativity may be a result of more frequent opportunities for patients with narcolepsy to incubate ideas during daytime naps (with REM sleep). Moreover, the high dream recall frequency observed in narcolepsy may also provide them with a high pool of inspiring new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, an increased creativity is demonstrated in subjects with narcolepsy, providing a silver lining to this disastrous disease. These young adults are often considered lazy, but it appears their proficient lucid dreaming and creative abilities may help researchers better understand the role of dreaming in everyone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image credit: “Grayscale photo of sleeping woman lying on bed” by Kinga Cichewicz.

While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Becerril-García believes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is undesirable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential. Interestingly, as the debate has played out, it is not only OA advocates in the South that have been reaching the conclusion that AmeliCA has.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Heeded and acted upon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will have to wait and see exactly how influential AmeliCA has been. Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S. For her part, Becerril-García hopes that the feedback that she and others have provided has been heeded and will be acted upon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amongst other things, Becerril-García believes that cOAlition S should commit some of its funding to help build the infrastructure and technology needed to allow the academy to regain control of science communication. So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11&quot;&gt;rumour on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003. Amongst other things, this saw it partner recently with UNESCO and a group of other national and regional open access platforms to launch the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;). The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on open access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in &lt;i&gt;vis-à-vis&lt;/i&gt; the international scholarly publishing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis? My suspicion is that this is unlikely to prove possible for so long as the Global North remains so deeply wedded to the principles of neoliberalism.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get a fuller view of AmeliCA’s hopes and ambitions please read the answers Becerril-García gives below to a number of questions I emailed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can you say something about yourself, your institution and your research interests/specialism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I am a professor-researcher and computer engineer in the Science Communication and Dissemination Research Group of the School of Political and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaemex.mx/&quot;&gt;UAEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hold a master’s degree and a PhD in computer sciences and my research interests are semantic technologies, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, technologies for science communication and open access, and data visualisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UAEM is a Mexican public university and a leading and pioneering institution with regard to open access.

Redalyc has developed technology to strengthen and provide visibility to journals in the region. Currently, there are 1,305 journals and upwards of 650,000 full-text articles available on the platform from which more than 100 million texts are downloaded per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Redalyc provides an indexing system. To be accepted for inclusion in the index, journals first have to go through a rigorous quality evaluation process. We also offer services to complement what journals provide on their own websites – e.g. tools to enable journals to generate XML that is compliant with ANSI/NISO JATS standards and to provide PDF, HTML and ePUB reading formats, as well as an article interactive reader for reading articles on desktop computers as well as on mobile devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also provide interoperability and search engine optimisation services to enable the journals to be transparently integrated with the Directory of Open Access Journals (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;DOAJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; and hundreds of content aggregators and libraries all around the world. The metadata are exported automatically to help maximize the visibility and impact of the content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, Redalyc has developed a set of metrics for regional scholarly publications, institutions and countries to indicate levels of collaboration, internationalisation and usage of scholarly content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA is a project launched by Redalyc with the support of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clacso.org/&quot;&gt;CLACSO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; and UNESCO that aims to create a communication system – not an indexing system like Redalyc – for the more than 15,000 current journals from the region.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, we offer the technology developed by Redalyc as part of a cooperative strategy in which dozens of institutions with various decentralised and coordinated projects at different universities and research groups from the region are able to participate. We all share the same goal: a collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated open access system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;In control of the academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Should I conclude from what you say that AmeliCA does not believe commercial publishers ought to play a role in scholarly communication? If it does see a role for them, what role should that be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; It seems to me that the way in which the question is posed suggests that the only alternative model to the one AmeliCA proposes is one that involves commercial publishers. From where I stand the situation is more complex, and even more complex when we observe the different regional contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We know that before the Second World War the participation of commercial publishers was limited, and journals depended mostly on professional associations. In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;the oligopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;amp;Src=IP&amp;amp;Alias=WOK5&quot;&gt;Web of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scopus.com/&quot;&gt;Scopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources. This is the system of evaluation used today for researchers, for projects and for journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is a system from which Latin American scientific publications are largely excluded, especially those from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Consequently, researchers are forced to publish in journals owned by commercial publishers who are mainly based outside the region, and in order to make their work open access they now have to pay an APC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of AmeliCA is to support and consolidate a native model that has operated in Latin America for more than 30 years, a model in which the publishing process is financed in a structured and rooted manner with public resources provided via local universities. This is the starting point and our aim is to demonstrate that different models of scholarly publishing have developed than one controlled by commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What has also been happening in our region recently is that journals that have been locally founded and developed – with public resources – and then internationalised, are being acquired by commercial publishers; there are several examples where the publisher is not an academic publisher anymore. These are journals that were created and consolidated with public resources, and then supported by Redalyc for years in order to attain international visibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our view is that this kind of appropriation, and the considerable restrictions researchers now face in order to share, process and publish their work open access, among many other characteristics of the models used by big commercial publishers, are unacceptable for the development of science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The commercial strategies that for-profit publishers have adopted for open access are ravenous, exclusionary and unsustainable. This is entirely contrary to the vision of open access that AmeliCA supports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe that developing a scholarly communication system that is in control of the academy is a much healthier strategy for science and society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it that commercial publishers are a pivotal actor in science communication – in many parts of the world – if most of the activities needed to generate knowledge are undertaken by the academy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why did commercial publishers shift from being the providers of publishing services to the owners of content, and now owners of the tools needed in all stages of the scientific communication process?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which of these various roles is truly beneficial to science?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Free from paywalls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In January, AmeliCA published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kXe1UO4beE&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;directly contrasting the approach being taken by the new European OA initiative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/oa2020-and-coalition-s/&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; with what AmeliCA aims to achieve. The video argues that some of Plan S’s goals are “counterposed” with those of AmeliCA. For instance, it says, where Plan S simply aims to regulate commercial agreements, AmeliCA is focused on “building an infrastructure from and for the academy.” Can you say something more about how AmeliCA aims to achieve this and why it is concerned about Plan S?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; AmeliCA’s goal is that all knowledge should be free from paywalls and in that respect, its view coincides with Plan S, and with the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-02-04.htm&quot;&gt;BBB definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” of open access. It also agrees with Plan S that authors should retain the copyright in their works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where we would diverge is if Plan S seeks to replace the pay-for-reading model of subscription publishing with a pay-for-publishing one, and to do so in a way that leaves publishing in the control of commercial publishers (as discussed in the previous question). Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions. This investment should aim to return resources to the institutions that generate knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, AmeliCA seeks the same goal as Plan S but wants to achieve it by means of cooperation between multiple academic institutions. In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A clear example of this can be seen at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unlp.edu.ar/&quot;&gt;National University of La Plata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; in Argentina. There you can see a very strong, determined, and prepared group already using AmeliCA’s technology to sustain its journals and prevent the implementation of APCs, or the intervention of commercial publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This group is composed of researchers and students and they are being trained in publishing matters in order to sustain the work in the future. Everything is financed with resources from the university and supported by the infrastructure and technology that AmeliCA offers and that Redalyc developed over many years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: AmeliCA is focused primarily on Latin America. More recently, UNESCO announced the launch of the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;GLOALL&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;. This brings together the coordinators of six platforms: AmeliCA, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajol.info/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;AJOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;É&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erudit.org/en/&quot;&gt;rudit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/&quot;&gt;J-STAGE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openedition.org/?lang=en&quot;&gt;OpenEdition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scielo.org/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, with the aim “to democratize scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”. Aside from the geographical spread of the participants, and the emphasis on language diversity of GLOALL, what distinguishes its aims from those of AmeliCA and Plan S? Is GLOALL more about &lt;/i&gt;articulating&lt;i&gt; an alternative vision to Plan S or are there real-life &lt;/i&gt;practical initiatives&lt;i&gt; planned? If so, what kind of initiatives?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLOALL, in my view, offers the potential for great platforms to work together to create a non-commercial open access future. This need not explicitly oppose commercial publishers but could work from another point of view, one that conceives knowledge as a public common good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I should stress that this is my personal view. GLOALL is a new initiative and the scope has yet to be defined. We know that we share common goals and that these need to be realised in the form of policies, projects and strategies, and to be focused on achieving open access aligned with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;established in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/sustainable-development/SDGs/index_en.htm&quot;&gt;United Nations 2030 Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA will willingly share its technology and experience with GLOALL members, and with any region that wishes to strengthen the model we believe in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Three weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://africanopenscience.org.za/&quot;&gt;African Open Science Platform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;joined with cOAlition S (the group of funders behind Plan S) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oa2020.org/&quot;&gt;OA2020&lt;/a&gt; (a European initiative with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/oa2020-and-coalition-s/&quot;&gt;same goals as Plan S&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;to sign the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;São Paulo Statement on Open Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; This was done at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/news/2019-annual-meeting-sao-paulo/&quot;&gt;annual meetin&lt;/a&gt;g &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of the Global Research Council (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearchcouncil.org/&quot;&gt;GRC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Can you say how this statement came about (i.e. who approached whom?) and how the statement fits with the goals of AmeliCA and GLOALL? How difficult was it to arrive at wording that all sides could agree on? What are the next steps if any?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The question is wrongly posed: AmeliCA didn’t join with either cOAlition S or with OA2020. AmeliCA was invited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/&quot;&gt;Science Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to participate in an event. Several other platforms were invited and together we signed a statement reaffirming the common goal we all share of freeing knowledge from paywalls. This is the goal of dozens and hundreds of platforms. The São Paulo Statement does no more than state that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our concern is not over the goals of Plan S but how they are implemented. The purpose of the meeting we had with the Plan S architects was to discuss that. And at that meeting, I explained our stance (as discussed in the previous questions). I also presented our stance publicly in a panel held at the GRC event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aside from stating that we reject the APC model, I mentioned in that meeting the risk of disrupting the Latin American system by implementing a Eurocentric model, and I resolutely asked why institutions and governments in Latin America would be motivated to continue subsidising scholarly publishing if strategies are put in place that will end up driving more public money to commercial enterprises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I pointed out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. And I asked: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have repeatedly expressed our concerns about Plan S. Now we are waiting for cOAlition S to announce its final implementation plans. We hope that the feedback phase has been useful, and that cOAlition S will adjust their strategy to enable an inclusive, participative open access model to be developed, one in which non-profit scholarly communication is taken into account when financial resources are distributed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If they don’t, Plan S will only further weaken those publishing activities that are still in the control of the academy, and strengthen commercial publishers – to the point perhaps where the former will disappear altogether. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA’s goals are crystal clear: we want scholarly publishing to be in the hands of the academy – universities and professional associations. In other words, to continue working in the way that Redalyc has been working for decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: The wording of the São Paulo Statement is very general and does not specify much in the way of practical action. As you will know, cOAlition S has been struggling to get global buy-in for Plan S, and has attracted criticism in the Global South for attempting to foist a one-size-fits-all Eurocentric model (as you call it) of scholarly publishing on the world. I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement? What benefits do you think signing it might bring to the Global South?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Scholarly publishing is a global ecosystem that already exists. Consequently, for a proposal to be established as global, and for everyone’s benefit, all countries and institutions need to participate in the discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would highlight several points about which I believe there is agreement in the South, although with some nuances: the present model is unsustainable, and knowledge must be freed from paywalls. Every stakeholder agrees with this other than those who benefit from the way things currently are. The only point of disagreement, as I said, is over how open access is achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the South, Redalyc, AmeliCA, CLACSO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latindex.org/latindex/inicio&quot;&gt;Latindex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lareferencia.info/en/&quot;&gt;LaReferencia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (amongst others) have &lt;a href=&quot;http://reuniondeconsorcios.conricyt.mx/index.php/primera-reunion/declaraciones/?lang=en&quot;&gt;expressed their strong objection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; to the APC model. And I expressed this clearly and vehemently at São Paolo, so I hope that the final implementation guidelines will demonstrate that cOAlition S has listened to the feedback it has received and is prepared to provide resources for non-profit players. Here I am thinking of non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools. If this happens then our engaging with cOAlition S will have led to something positive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if Plan S ends up dismantling the current harmful system for evaluating research and researchers based on the false prestige bestowed on publications by the Impact Factor – as called for by the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – there is no doubt that the South would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As to any PR benefits the São Paulo Statement may have: I wouldn’t like to think the meeting was only undertaken for media purposes. In signing the statement, we wanted to give a vote of confidence to the notion that communication and feedback between the North and South is a good thing. Plan S and the general public know AmeliCA’s principles and values. We unwaveringly affirm them and will keep working towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I believe AmeliCA plans to publish a public response to the São Paulo Statement. What will be the aim and purpose of that public response and when do you expect to publish it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; We signed the declaration and we shared it. However, I would stress that several platforms signed it, some of which AmeliCA and Redalyc distance themselves from completely. It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together with other institutions AmeliCA and Redalyc are working towards, and hope to further, non-commercial open access (as I have explained) and we resolutely support DORA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal. I would, however, note that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/&quot;&gt;SciELO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; – another regional initiative in Latin America – has signed an agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/&quot;&gt;Clarivate Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. In doing so they have chosen a different route, one that legitimises the Impact Factor as a way of ranking the importance of journals. They have also chosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarivate.com/products/scholarone/&quot;&gt;ScholarOne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; (which is a proprietary Clarivate Analytics product) as their publishing platform in Brazil, rather than the open source software Open Journal Systems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;OJS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; developed by Public Knowledge Project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;PKP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;. And they are encouraging the publishing of journals in English over local languages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This interview allows us to take a deeper look at the complexities of these issues, which we’ll also share in a publication on the AmeliCA web site and via other means and forums in the coming days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S may sign general declarations with dozens or hundreds of actors, but it is clear that the real detail and discussion must be found in the “small print” – that is, in the implementation guidelines. We are all waiting for news from Plan S about that. Let’s see how they’ve enriched their understanding and stance after the multiple conversations they have had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Terribly alarming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I sometimes think that OA advocates in the global North have spent 17-odd years working towards a solution that (as AmeliCA puts it) “simply aims to regulate commercial agreements” and are now realising that this approach is creating a system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberquarterly.eu/article/10.18352/lq.10280/&quot;&gt;no more financially sustainable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; than the subscription system. Would you agree? If so, how can this be resolved at this point in time? Might it be too late?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; If the focus of any new initiative is on replacing the model of paying-to-read with one based on paying-to-publish, it will inevitably create an unsustainable and non-inclusive system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is clear is that at this point in time the control of scholarly publishing is in the hands of commercial publishers, and so any planned change must necessarily include them. However, in the process of change control needs to be transferred to academia – to academic institutions, to universities, to academic associations, and to other stakeholders whose focus is on the development of science rather than promoting private commercial interests. And if this is done in a collective manner and in a distributed and fair way the value and power of scholarly communication can be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means building infrastructure, taking advantage of the great benefits that communication and information technologies now offer, professionalising institutions so that they can create a publishing tradition, and anything else that can further the task of taking back control of scholarly communication which is currently dominated by private interests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As things stand, the South cannot escape the perversion of the system. It saddens us to see how more and more national systems of journal assessment disqualify local journals if they don’t rank in the first quartiles of Scopus or Web of Science, no matter how much they have contributed to the history and problem solving of the discipline or region concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a consequence, local journals are now receiving fewer direct resources. And they are receiving fewer contributions because researchers are discouraged from publishing in them. Researchers are discouraged because local journals do not fulfil the requirements needed to be considered “mainstream”, and researchers’ salaries and incentives depend on being published in mainstream journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has happened in Colombia, in Mexico and in many other countries. The agreements between SciELO and Clarivate Analytics, the appropriation of journals by commercial publishers, the hiring of SpringerOpen by public universities to dictate how and where to publish, the list of such examples is vast. Right now, we are looking at an ecosystem at risk of total collapse. And that is terribly alarming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Million-dollar question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Is it in your view possible to build a global system of scholarly communication (and an open-access infrastructure) able to meet the needs of all countries in a fair and equitable way, both countries &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in the Global South and those in the Global North? If so, what might it look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AB-G:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; That is the million-dollar question. Thank you for asking, and for thinking that I could provide even the draft of an answer. Undoubtedly, that is what we all want, and because of that we gather together and debate the issue. But let me share my viewpoint on that with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to start by asking: what science communication model or paradigm can be considered a suitable one for humanity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not necessarily a matter of South or North. We must go back to basics and recover the essence of what science communication is and should be. Is it to communicate research, and to do so to the limit of what is possible in order to attain the greatest efficacy and efficiency in putting scientific and technological advances at society’s disposal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We must remind ourselves that the goal of publishing is to make our research available for the public, to submit findings to public scrutiny, and to do so in a way that allows everyone to access knowledge without restriction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We need to facilitate a global conversation that focuses on both the large and small problems humanity faces and to ensure that all researchers are able to participate in that conversation, not only those who can pay to take part in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current information technologies enable us to rethink what is now taken for granted. We can deconstruct what we know does not work and we can decide what engine is needed to further the agendas and work of researchers. And we can be more creative in planning how to distribute resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many efforts have been made to do this around the world, there hasn’t yet been enough determination and resources put into uniting these isolated and disparate efforts. Open access and scholarly communication find themselves at a key historical moment and we are now in a position, and have a great opportunity, to redraw the system of scholarly communication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I imagine a web of data for science, a knowledge cloud – sustainable and open – that promotes a participatory and inclusive science communication system, one in which every institution that is generating knowledge is able to connect it into a giant graph of knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to do that I strongly believe that academic institutions must not only be the generators – as it were – of this asset, but also the owners and transmitters of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for answering my questions. I look forward to seeing how the various initiatives you are involved in develop going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>Open and Shut?: Why did Riksbankens Jubileumsfond decide to leave cOAlition S?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7961882.post-8643079142044142360</guid>

	<description>&lt;span&gt;Last September a group of (mainly) European funders (cOAlition S) launched a new open access initiative called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The goal was to make all publicly funded research open access by 2020. And to that end, a month later (November) a set of draft implementation guidelines for the plan were published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;600&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgNKZLszjgw/XPine4l_b0I/AAAAAAAAlR0/FIHIIWhUxE8bzhfMbweAkimImTzH17LZwCLcBGAs/s200/800px-Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Image Simeon87 &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Farewell_signs#/media/File:Back_of_Las_Vegas_Sign_at_Night.JPG&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S proved controversial and, amongst other things, led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/home&quot;&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; of protest being launched. &lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help ease the way and encourage buy-in, therefore, cOAlition S opened the guidelines up for public consultation. This attracted more than 600 responses and saw the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/revised-implementation-guidance/&quot;&gt;revised guidelines&lt;/a&gt; last week (31st May). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The updated guidelines have been better received, even by publishers. Elsevier, for instance, has “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-welcomes-new-open-access-guidance-from-coalition-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcomed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” them, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yacadeuro.org/2019/06/05/press-release-researchers-respond-to-revised-guidance-for-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; open access advocates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, Plan S appears to still be struggling to sign up new funders. When it launched, there were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sparcopen.org/news/2018/coalition-european-funders-announces-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;10 funders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; today there are still only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/funders-and-supporters/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Many believe this is too few to trigger the change to scholarly communication that cOAlition S members want. Importantly, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;two largest producers of research papers in the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – China and the US – are notable by their absence from the coalition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, while cOAlition S is quick to tell the world when it signs up a new funder, it is silent when a funder leaves the coalition. It has not, for instance, publicly commented on the decision by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/en&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to leave the coalition. RJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s name just disappeared from the Plan S web page sometime during the week beginning 20th May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How, when and why did RJ leave?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March RJ published &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an open letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; addressed to cOAlition S in which it expressed some concerns about the initiative and said, “RJ remains in the Coalition S, but cannot support Plan S in its current form.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It added that it believed Plan S needed to be “more flexible and discussed more openly with the research community.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Leave or remain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next day (7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March) RJ posted a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jubileumsfonden/status/1103607518209732610?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; saying that it could no longer support the timetable for Plan S and linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/Forskningsnyheter/2019/rj-avvisar-tidsplanen-for-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on its web site. This note stressed RJ’s support for open science but repeated that it could not support the Plan S schedule. It added, however, that it had emphasised to cOAlition S that it wanted to remain in the group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet three days before cOAlition S published its revised guidance (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;May 28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;) RJ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rj.se/en/Researcher-news/general-news/riksbankens-jubileumsfond-steps-away-from-plan-s/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that it had left the coalition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The announcement added: “After consultation with researchers and discussions within the Board, Jubileumsfond decided on March 6, 2019 to step away from Plan S. Our assessment is that the process is too fast to suit humanities and social sciences. This also means that we have left cOAlition S, but we continue to support their ambitions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Confusingly, although the May 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;announcement says that the decision to leave the coalition had been taken on March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, RJ’s letter of that date emphasised that RJ was remaining in the Coalition S. Its continuing commitment to the coalition was repeated in the note of 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the hope of better understanding what had happened and why RJ appeared to be making contradictory statements I emailed the CEO of RJ, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Hedin&quot;&gt;Marika Hedin&lt;/a&gt;. (Hedin took over as CEO on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; February. The decision to sign up to Plan S had therefore been taken by the former CEO.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked Hedin if perhaps the problem was that the former CEO had signed up to Plan S before RJ’s Board had had an opportunity to discuss and approve the decision. She replied, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, I think that you have misunderstood the situation. Our CEO is authorised to make decisions like this, and in the early talks of Plan S, the aims seemed completely aligned with the already far-reaching Open Access policies that Riksbankens Jubileumsfond has had since 2010.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Evolved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hedin added, “However, when Plan S was published in November it had evolved. There were thorough discussions and consultations about this in our Board during our former CEO, and during his last and my first board meeting in late February, it was jointly decided to step away from Plan S. We were all in complete agreement on this, he, I and our Board of Directors. He and I then wrote a letter jointly to the COAlition declaring this, which was published on our website March 6.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, this does not seem entirely consonant with what was said in the March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;letter. It is also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; not clear in what way Plan S had evolved such that it had now become unacceptable to RJ. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;10 Plan S Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;– which surely make clear to signatories what they are being asked to sign up to – had been published in September and presumably funders would have been asked to agree to the 10 principles before signing up. Either way, we might wonder why it took six months for RJ to become concerned over what it had signed up to, and eight months before it eventually left cOAlition S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More puzzling perhaps, the May 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;announcement came just three days before cOAlition S published its updated guidelines. These might seem to have addressed RJ’s concerns. That is, the start date has been delayed, and greater flexibility has been provided for implementation. In other words, cOAlition S might seem to have heard and addressed the concerns of RJ. But RJ left anyway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;asked the interim coordinator of cOAlition S (and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/author/robert-kiley/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Head of Open Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the Wellcome Trust) Robert Kiley whether Plan S had evolved over time he said “no changes were made to Plan S other than the changes we announced on Friday.” (I.e. in the updated guidelines published on 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; May).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what went wrong? Was cOAlition S so keen to sign up funders that it failed to outline exactly what they were being asked to commit to? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wasn’t involved in Plan S until &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the Principles had been published (September 2018)”, Kiley told me, “so have no knowledge of what might have been discussed prior to their publication (or whether RJ were part of these discussions or not).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or was it rather that when Plan S came up for discussion at the RJ Board, members rejected the CEO’s decision to sign up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still confused, I invited Hedin to do a full Q&amp;amp;A. She replied, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank you, but I have no further comments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After making that decision our Board of Directors have also decided to not participate in the current debate but rather continue discussing this issue within our own organisation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Our relationship with cOAlition S is good and we support their efforts even though we have stepped out of the process of Plan S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At this point we do not plan to make a statement about RJ leaving the cOAlition,” Kiley told me. “I hope in time that RJ may reconsider their position and once again align themselves with Plan S.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Openness and transparency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But does any of this matter? Is it important to anyone but RJ (and cOAlition S) that it decided to sign up to Plan S and then later changed its mind? Does it matter if the reason for leaving is not clear? Perhaps it doesn’t. The incident reminds us, however, that the Plan S project underlines the way in which the open access movement has morphed from a bottom-up to a top-down movement, and transparency has increasingly been sacrificed in the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above all, open access was meant to be about openness, clarity and transparency. This is not what we see today. Rather opaqueness and opacity have become the norm. And this change appears to date from&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html&quot;&gt; the point at which funders began to take up the cause&lt;/a&gt; and started introducing ever more oppressive OA mandates. Increasingly, decisions are taken behind closed doors and new rules are imposed on unwilling and hapless researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And is there not a hint of hypocrisy here? Principle 5 of Plan S insists that publishers must be transparent about their pricing and processes, including their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/journal-transparency-rules-help-scholars-pick-where-publish&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;editorial policies, their decision-making, their acceptance rates and their review times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Researchers, meanwhile, face ever more bureaucratic scrutiny in order to ensure compliance and are threatened with sanctions if they fail to comply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should we not expect cOAlition S members to live by the same rules of responsibility and transparency that they seek to force on publishers and researchers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it not therefore incumbent on RJ to explain in more detail what it thought it was signing up to, why it signed up if it did not understand the implications of doing so, and why it subsequently chose to leave, despite apparently having had its demands met – that is, both the timetable and the implementation of Plan S were adjusted to become more flexible? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should we not also expect decisions about open access to be decided in a democratic and open manner? How, for instance, did signatory funders make their decisions about joining Plan S and how open to scrutiny is that decision-making process?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1100679321868554240&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;invited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; all members of cOAlition S to send me a link to, or copy of, the minutes of the meetings of the board (or similar) where it was agreed to join the coalition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only three funders responded and not one pointed me to any minutes. Of those who responed, two were private funders – the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation – and one a public funder, Formas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In responding for Wellcome, Kiley &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1100168492848951296&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been taken by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/executive-leadership-team&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Executive Leadership Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This might seem to suggest that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us/governance/board-governors&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wellcome Board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which has ultimate responsibility for Wellcome’s activities) had not been consulted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Formas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pressformas/status/1111600447628955648&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;replied&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the decision to sign up to Plan S had been made by the Director General, with no mention of the Formas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://formas.se/om-formas/sa-styrs-formas/forskarradet.html#Innehall&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific Council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; having been asked to give approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the minutes of the Board meetings of the Research Council of Norway posted on the Web suggested that the funder did not discuss Plan S until three months after it had signed up. (The minutes of the meeting appear now to have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Saklister_og_referater/1195592857784&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;taken down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from the embarrassment of signing up to an initiative like Plan S only to have the decision later overturned by the Board, this kind of executive power grab is out of tune with the open, transparent and democratic principles that the OA movement was built on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In its letter of March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; RJ makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rj.se/globalassets/forskningsnyheter/2019/coalition-s_rj_190306.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an important point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: it says that by seeking to force Plan S on researchers without adequate consultation the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt; of Plan S, “has succeeded to turn researchers who have been in favour of Open Science and Robert Merton’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CUDOS principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against these positions. This is an unfortunate development.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That perhaps is the key issue: forcing oppressive OA mandates on researchers may turn out to be counterproductive. Perhaps that is the real reason why RJ left cOAlition S: the failure to get researcher buy-in &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;announcing the initiative. But then why did RJ’s CEO sign up in the first place? Why did RJ not express concern until six months later? And why is it not willing to talk openly and publicly about what happened? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all, if RJ’s concerns about the dangers of seeking to force open access on researchers are valid then the issue is of wider significance than Plan S alone. It is of relevance to the very future of open access and how it is (or is not) achieved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXVI) Codes and processes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1626</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxvi-codes-and-processes/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two classes of problems with the concept of neural codes. Initially, while working on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;critique of the neural coding metaphor&lt;/a&gt;, I focused mostly on the epistemic problem (the first two parts of the paper). The epistemic problem is that when we say that Y is a neural code for X and that Y is metaphorically decoded by the brain, we imply that Y is informative about X by simple virtue of being in lawful relation with X. But this is a kind of information that is only available to an external observer who can see both X and Y, knows the two domains and the correspondence. If not X but X’ caused the neural activity Y, the organism would never know from just observing Y. Therefore Y cannot be a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X for the organism. Of course it could be a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; representation of X, if the organism could observe that Y is in lawful relation with Z, a primary representation of X. But then we need to account for the existence of that primary representation, which cannot be based on an encoding. A number of other authors have made similar criticisms, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiii-the-interactivist-model-of-cognition/&quot;&gt;Mark Bickhard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epistemic problem is, I would say, the “easy problem” of neural codes. Addressing it gives rise to alternative notions of information based on internal relations, such as O’Regan’s sensorimotor contingencies, Gibson’s invariance structure, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129&quot;&gt;subjective physics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a deeper, more fundamental problem. It has to do with substance vs. process metaphysics and the way time is conceived (or in this case, disregarded). I address it in the third part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3&quot;&gt;neural coding essay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9&quot;&gt;in my response to commentaries&lt;/a&gt; (especially the third part). To explain it, I will compare the neural code with the genetic code. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/&quot;&gt;problematic aspects&lt;/a&gt; with the idea of a “genetic code”, but in its most unproblematic form, there is a lawful correspondence between triplets of nucleotides and amino acids, which we can call a code. Nucleotides and amino acids are two types of substances, that is, some stable entities (molecules). Nucleotides are transformed into amino acids by some process that unfolds through time (translation). A process is not a substance; it may involve some substance, for sure (e.g. enzymes), but it is the activity that defines the process. The code refers to some lawful relation between two types of substances, disregarding the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this analysis in mind, “neural codes” now look very peculiar. The neural end of the code is not a substance at all. It is a particular measurement of the activity of neurons done at a particular time, for example the number of spikes during a particular time window. We then consider that this number is the output of some process, some kind of stable entity that can be further manipulated and transformed by some other processes. Of course this is exactly what it is for the experimenter, who manipulates those measurements, makes calculations etc. But from the organism’s perspective this view is very puzzling: the activity of neurons &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the process, not the result of a process (what other process?). Neurons do not produce stable entities like amino acids which can participate in various processes. A spike is not a stable entity, it is a timed event in the process of neural interaction (like, say, the binding of an enzyme on RNA), and measurements like spike counts are simply “snapshots” of that process. It is not coherent to treat signatures of processes as if they were substances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We all know that goats have complex vocalizations, but very few of us know what they mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the health and well-being of livestock, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2019.00024/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;greater understanding of Farm Animal Cognition is also important&quot;&gt;advantageous to understand&lt;/a&gt; the emotional states conveyed by vocalizations, postures, and other behaviors. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Emotions in goats: mapping physiological, behavioural and vocal profiles&quot;&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; measured the acoustic features of different goat calls, along with their associated behavioral and physiological responses. Twenty-two adult goats were put in four situations: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;(1) control (neutral)&lt;br /&gt;(2) anticipation of a food reward (positive)&lt;br /&gt;(3) food-related frustration (negative)&lt;br /&gt;(4) social isolation (negative)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dr. Elodie Briefer and colleagues conducted the study at a goat sanctuary in Kent, UK (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buttercups.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats&lt;/a&gt;). The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days. Additional details are presented in the first footnote.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/goatvocalization/home/sound/goat%20calls%20%28negative-positive%29.mp3?attredirects=0&amp;amp;d=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#dfig1&quot; title=&quot;Audio A1&quot;&gt;Audio A1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; One call produced during a negative situation (food frustration), followed  by a call produced during a positive situation (food reward) by the same goat (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Briefer et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behavioral responses during the scenarios were timed and scored; these included tail position, locomotion, rapid head movement, ear orientation, and number of calls. The investigators recorded the calls and produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spectograms&lt;/a&gt; that illustrated the frequencies of the vocal signals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-605iRERme5k/XOGnR2RkhdI/AAAAAAAAM14/EPB0MEnIDpMhrpmFEasKScRN5vfAuAQAgCLcBGAs/s1600/goat%2Bspectograms.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;283&quot; data-original-width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-605iRERme5k/XOGnR2RkhdI/AAAAAAAAM14/EPB0MEnIDpMhrpmFEasKScRN5vfAuAQAgCLcBGAs/s400/goat%2Bspectograms.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The call on the left &lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; was emitted during food frustration (first call in Audio A1). The call on the right &lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; was produced during food reward; it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;has a lower fundamental frequency (F0) and smaller frequency modulations.&lt;/span&gt; Modified from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Audio A1&quot;&gt;Fig. 2 (Briefer et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both negative and positive food situations resulted in greater goat arousal (measured by heart rate) than the neutral control condition and the low arousal negative condition (social isolation). Behaviorally speaking, arousal and valence had different indicators: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;During high arousal situations, goats displayed more head movements,  moved more, had their ears pointed forwards more often and to the side less often, and produced more calls. ... In  positive situations, as opposed to negative ones, goats had their ears  oriented backwards less often and spent more time with the tail up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Happy goats have their tails up, and do not point their ears backwards. I think I would need a lot more training to identify the range of goat emotions conveyed in my amateur video. At least I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_(film)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;ha, ha&quot;&gt;not to stare at them&lt;/a&gt;, but next time I should read more about their reactions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-014-0777-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;‘Goats that stare at men’: dwarf goats alter their behaviour in response to human head orientation, but do not spontaneously use head direction as a cue in a food-related context&quot;&gt;human head and body postures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do goats show a left or right hemisphere advantage for vocal perception? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the researchers have characterized the valence and arousal communicated by goat calls, another study asked whether goats show a left hemisphere or right hemisphere “preference” for the perception of different calls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Baciadonna et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). How is this measured, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;Head-Turning in Goats and Babies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head-turn preference paradigm is widely used in studies of speech perception in infants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure from &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;back to article&quot; data-track-category=&quot;figure&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2430#f4&quot;&gt;Prosody cues word order in 7-month-old bilingual infants&lt;/a&gt; (Gervain &amp;amp; Werker, 2013).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dB4B0eOuPtA/XOHB4Sd8egI/AAAAAAAAM2E/FdZSkoJoRfs9R-vvwE8pTHZ0z-wUp6ekQCLcBGAs/s1600/head%2Bturn%2Bpreference%2Bparadigm%2Bin%2Bhuman%2Binfants.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;654&quot; data-original-width=&quot;926&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dB4B0eOuPtA/XOHB4Sd8egI/AAAAAAAAM2E/FdZSkoJoRfs9R-vvwE8pTHZ0z-wUp6ekQCLcBGAs/s320/head%2Bturn%2Bpreference%2Bparadigm%2Bin%2Bhuman%2Binfants.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don't know whether this paradigm is used to assess lateralization of speech perception in babies. In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure. For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (&lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45&quot;&gt;Teufel et al. 2007&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43&quot; id=&quot;__tag_746041107&quot;&gt;Siniscalchi et al. 2008&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ... The assumption is  also supported by the neuroanatomic evidence of the contralateral  connection of the auditory pathways in the mammalian brain (&lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B37&quot;&gt;Rogers and Andrew 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B28&quot; id=&quot;__tag_746041121&quot;&gt;Ocklenburg et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experimental set-up to test this in goats is shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s1600/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;426&quot; data-original-width=&quot;633&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s400/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A feeding bowl (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;filled with a tasty mixture of dry pasta and hay) was fixed at the center of the arena opposite to the entrance. The speakers were positioned at a distance of 2 meters from the right and left side of the bowl and were aligned to it. 'X' indicates the position of the Experimenter. &lt;b&gt;Modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot;&gt;Fig. 2 (&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/&quot;&gt;Baciadonna et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot;&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four types of vocalizations were played over the speakers: food anticipation, food frustration, isolation, and dog bark (presumably a negative stimulus). Three examples of each vocalization were played, each from a different and unfamiliar goat (or dog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various theories of brain lateralization of emotion predicted different results. The &lt;b&gt;right hemisphere model &lt;/b&gt;predicts right hemisphere dominance (head turn to the left) for high-arousal emotion regardless of valence (food anticipation, food frustration, dog barks). In contrast, the &lt;b&gt;valence model&lt;/b&gt; predicts right hemisphere dominance for processing negative emotions (food frustration, isolation, dog barks), and left hemisphere dominance for positive emotions (food anticipation). The &lt;b&gt;conspecific model&lt;/b&gt; predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a &lt;b&gt;general emotion model&lt;/b&gt; predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results sort of supported the &lt;b&gt;conspecific model&lt;/b&gt; (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [&lt;i&gt;if I understand correctly&lt;/i&gt;]. The head-orienting response did not differ significantly between the four vocalizations, and there was a slight bias for head orienting to the right (p=.046 vs. chance level), when collapsed across all stimulus types.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time to resume feeding after hearing a vocalization (a measure of fear) didn't differ between goat calls and dog barks, so the authors concluded that “goats at our study site may have been habituated to dog barks and that they did not perceive dog barks as a serious threat.” However, if a Siberian Husky breaks free of its owner and runs around a fenced-in rent-a-goat herd, chaos may ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Methodological details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“(1) During the control situation, goats were left unmanipulated in a pen with hay (‘Control’). This situation did not elicit any calls, but allowed us to obtain baseline values for physiological and behavioural data. (2) The positive situation was the anticipation of an attractive food reward that the goats had been trained to receive during 3 days of habituation (‘Feeding’). (3) After goats had been tested with the Feeding situation, they were tested with a food frustration situation. This consisted of giving food to only one of the goats in the pair and not to the subject (‘Frustration’). (4) The second negative situation was brief isolation, out of sight from conspecifics behind a hedge. For this situation, goats were tested alone and not in a pair (‘Isolation’).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dantgilbert/status/470199929626193921&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;those shameless little bullies&quot;&gt;replication police&lt;/a&gt; will certainly go after such a marginal significance level, but I would like to see them organize a “Many Goats in Many Goat Sanctuaries” &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/wx7ck/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replication project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baciadonna L, Nawroth C, Briefer EF, McElligott AG.

&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 119&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5929&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-4.34.07-pm-300x160.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 120&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grey matter thins as connections are refined&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 121&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More white matter enables faster communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 122&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their &lt;em&gt;‘rational PFC’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;‘emotional limbic brain’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 127&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, &lt;em&gt;‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’&lt;/em&gt; That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, &lt;em&gt;‘They hate me. I’m going home!’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, &lt;em&gt;‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’&lt;/em&gt; The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 128&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, &lt;em&gt;‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,&lt;/em&gt; or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, &lt;em&gt;‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 128&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Many emotions girls experience are novel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 129&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel optimization algorithm, called the Magnetic Optimization Algorithms (MOAs), is proposed in this paper which is inspired by the principles of magnetic field theory. In MOA, the possible solutions are some magnetic particles scattered in the search space. In this respect, each magnetic particle has a measure of mass and magnetic field according to its fitness. In this scheme, the fitter magnetic particles are more massive, with stronger magnetic field. In terms of interaction, these particles are located in a structured population and apply a long range force of attraction to their neighbors. Ten different structures are proposed for the algorithm and the structure that offers the best performance is found. Also, to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm, several operators are proposed: a repulsive short-range force, an explosion operator, a combination of short-range force and explosion operator and a crossover interaction between the neighboring particles. In order to test the proposed algorithm and the proposed operators, the algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms on 21 numerical benchmark functions. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the existing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yi Sun's journal club session, where she will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=WE3SzeVEvDkC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR5&amp;amp;dq=%5B1%5D+Ramsay,+J.+O.+and+Silverman+B.W.:+Applied+Functional+Data+Analysis:+Methods+and+Case+Studies,+New+York:+Springer-Verlag,+2002.+Chapter+6+and+Chapter+7&amp;amp;ots=WPBFyEy6Io&amp;amp;sig=Emt7blkjWVVXl57sS2qzg3TxDV8#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Applied Functional Data Analysis Methods and Case Studies (Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman B.W, 2002)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has seen rapid development over the last two decades. FDA refers to a collection of methods for analysing data over a curve, surface or continuum. It is very much involved with computational statistics. FDA has been applied to quite broadly in medicine, business and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Yi will introduce the basic idea of FDA using a case study presented in the paper: zooming in on human growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human growth is not at all the simple process that one might imagine at first sight… Collecting records is time-consuming and expensive, because children have to be measured accurately and tracked for a long period of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We] consider how to make this sort of record into a useful functional datum to incorporate into further analyses. A smooth curve drawn through the points is commonly called a growth curve, but growth is actually the rate of increase of the height of the child. In children this is necessarily positive… [We] develop a monotone smoothing method that takes this sort of consideration into account and yields a functional datum that picks out important stages in a child’s growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses plays a principal role in learning in the cerebellum, which acts as a supervised learning machine. Recent experiments demonstrate various forms of synaptic plasticity at different sites within the cerebellum. In this article, we take into consideration synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses as well as at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and propose that the cerebellar cortex performs reinforcement learning, another form of learning that is more capable than supervised learning. We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.&lt;/p&gt;

Consumers assume that when they take an over-the-counter pain medication, it will relieve their physical symptoms, but they do not anticipate broader psychological effects.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latest installment of this alarmist saga, we learn that acetaminophen blunts positive empathy, i.e. the capacity to appreciate and identify with the positive emotions of others (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00538/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mischkowski et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). I'll discuss those findings another time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, let's evaluate the entire TYLENOL® oeuvre by taking a step back and examining the plausibility of the published claims. To summarize, one of the most common over-the-counter, non-narcotic, non-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug&quot;&gt;NSAID&lt;/a&gt; pain-relieving medications in existence supposedly alleviates the personal experience of hurt feelings and social pain and heartache (positive outcomes). At the same time, TYLENOL® blunts the phenomenological experiences of positive emotion and diminishes empathy for others' people's experiences, both good and bad (negative outcomes). Published articles have reported that many of these effects can be observed after ONE REGULAR DOSE of paracetamol. These findings are based on how undergraduates judge a series of hypothetical stories. One major problem (which is not specific to The Paracetamol Papers) concerns the ecological validity of laboratory tasks as measures of the cognitive and emotional constructs of interest. This issue is critical, but outside the main scope of our discussion today. More to the point, an experimental manipulation may cause a statistically significant shift in a variable of interest, but ultimately we have to decide whether a circumscribed finding in the lab has broader implications for society at large. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why TYLENOL® ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another puzzling element is, why choose acetaminophen as the exclusive pain medication of interest? Its mechanisms of action for relieving fever, headache, and other pains are unclear. Thus, the authors don't have a specific, principled reason for choosing TYLENOL® over Advil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;) or aspirin. Presumably, the effects should generalize, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For instance, ibuprofen actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/06/advil-increases-social-pain-if-youre.html&quot;&gt;Increases Social Pain&lt;/a&gt; in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analgesic effects of acetaminophen are mediated by a complex series of cellular mechanisms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). One proposed mechanism involves descending serotonergic bulbospinal pathways from the brainstem to the spinal cord. This isn't exactly Prozac territory, so the analogy between Tylenol and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SSRI antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; isn't apt. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the Cav3.2 calcium channel might also be part of the action (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). A recently recognized player is the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabinoid receptor&lt;/a&gt;. AM404, a metabolite of acetaminophen, indirectly activates CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting the breakdown and reuptake of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an endocannabinoid&quot;&gt; anandamide&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the brain  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intechopen.com/books/pain-relief-from-analgesics-to-alternative-therapies/paracetamol-update-on-its-analgesic-mechanism-of-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mallet et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s1600/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;281&quot; data-original-width=&quot;387&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zv5ljn95VQ/XMU-h1dF_yI/AAAAAAAAM0k/Yd0c5sjwTBUMYlJ5H9cV-5l-yUJWk8LkACLcBGAs/s400/cranberry%2Bhigh%2BCBD%2Bgummies.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cannabinoids, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the non-intoxicating cousin of THC &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; has a high profile now because of its soaring popularity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many ailments&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, CBD has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cbdv.200790147&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very low affinity&lt;/a&gt; for  CB&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;and&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;CB&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;receptors and may act instead via  &lt;span class=&quot;highlight selected&quot;&gt;sero&lt;/span&gt;tonergic 5-HT1A receptors {&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/41359764/Cannabidiol__Recent_Advances20160120-1921-1rxjn6j.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;amp;Expires=1556433869&amp;amp;Signature=fjs1C9zN1XpIOTs5FCsR8WmBrrY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCannabidiol_Recent_Advances.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;}, as a modulator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Μ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;μ-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94-opioid_receptor&quot; title=&quot;Δ-opioid receptor&quot;&gt;δ-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, and as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antagonist and inverse agonist&lt;/a&gt; at several G protein-coupled receptors. Most CBD use seems to be in the non-therapeutic (placebo) range, because the effective dose for, let's say, anxiety is 10-20 times higher than the average commercial product. You'd have to eat 3-6 bags of cranberry gummies for 285-570 mg of CBD (close to the 300-600 mg recommended dose). Unfortunately, you would also ingest 15-30 mg of THC, which would be quite intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&quot;the typical cup of CBD-infused coffee that you buy in your local trendy coffee shop will have, on average, 5-10 mg of CBD, which is nowhere near the therapeutic dosage [at least 300 mg] required for it to have any kind of anxiolytic effect&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/trytic2nf2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1121740961774571521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Words Have Meanings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If acetaminophen were so effective in “mending broken hearts”, “easing heartaches”, and providing a “cure for a broken heart”, we would be a society of perpetually happy automatons, wiping away the suffering of breakup and divorce with a mere OTC tablet. We'd have Tylenol epidemics and Advil epidemics to rival the scourge of the present Opioid Epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, social and political discourse in the US has reached a new low. Ironically, the paracetamol “blissed-out” population is enraged because they can't identify with the feelings or opinions of the masses who are 'different' than they are. Somehow, I don't think it's from taking too much Tylenol. A large-scale global survey could put that thought to rest for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;525&quot; data-original-width=&quot;663&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DFDC9sm-olw/XMUzSz3wFxI/AAAAAAAAM0Y/eR3fgOtlqvsv41lSxHyITTXr01bE0J9WQCLcBGAs/s400/The%2BWorld%2Bisn%2527t%2Bfeeling%2Bwell.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/26/nope-its-not-just-you-world-around-you-really-is-getting-angrier/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nope, it’s not just you: The world around you really is getting angrier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is not true, of course, I was only kidding.

&lt;h2&gt;Stress is an inevitable part of life.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel ‘stressed’ when real or imagined pressures exceed our perceived ability to cope. If things all feel ‘too much’, we experience the sensations of ‘stress’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But feeling stress is not always a bad thing. When stress is short-term and manageable, it motivates and facilitates learning and change. Stress only becomes toxic when it’s excessive or long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term low level ‘hum’ of stress or short-term excessive stress can increase our risk of developing serious medical conditions such as high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable the nuanced and very human responses to the diverse challenges that might come your way, the brain produces a highly coordinated and complex stress-response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Makes a Brain Healthy and Happy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health and happiness of our brain are our influenced by multiple interacting factors including biology, the world around us, and our thoughts, feelings and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One useful way to understand how our brain is influenced by so many complex factors is using the &lt;strong&gt;Bottom-Up, Outside-In,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Model of Brain Health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a useful framework to find discover different ways to buffer stress. &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5906&quot; height=&quot;684&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NSA_BottomUpOutsideInTopDown-1024x778.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-Up&lt;/strong&gt; elements are the biological or physiological determinants of brain health and include genes, hormones, the immune system, nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outside-In&lt;/strong&gt; elements include social and environmental factors, stress, life events, education, current circumstances, and family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down&lt;/strong&gt; elements include thoughts, emotions, mindset, and belief systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six Practical Stress-Busters Based on Brain Science.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Bottom-Up Outside-In Top-Down model, here are six practical strategies that allow you to find peace of mind amidst your challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom-Up Approach: Change your biology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Get a good night sleep and indulge in a nap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the cornerstone of good brain health. While we sleep, the brain consolidates memories and goes through an amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://sydney.edu.au/research/research-impact/sleep-the-new-frontier-in-dementia-prevention.html?fbclid=IwAR2-_vCcGtV9BH936jTs4d5Sf24qoVKGldqt0BOuGSXszIe0dZtu_N9U7Z0&quot;&gt;‘cleaning up’ process&lt;/a&gt; that appears to protect us from developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. Sleep also helps us manage stress by assisting with emotional regulation and the management of cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Sleep Action Tip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Getting around 7 to 9 hours sleep each night is believed to be what is required for good health. One of my favourite stress reduction (and productivity) strategies is to also &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/my-tedx-talk-indulge-your-neurobiology/&quot;&gt;take an afternoon nap&lt;/a&gt;. Napping is a great way to “reset” from the stressors of the day, while also smoothing out emotions and increasing clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Get moving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tight shoulders, shallow breathing, tension headaches and feels of overwhelm? Exercise can help reverse the effects of stress by releasing muscle tension, increasing oxygen levels, boosting feel-good hormones (endorphins), while also using up excess adrenaline and cortisol released as part of our stress response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find exercise one of the easiest ways to reduce my stress levels, definitely easier than thought-based or mindfulness strategies. For many people, exercise becomes an effective&lt;em&gt; meditation in motion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23795769&quot;&gt;Exercising outside and with others has also been linked to increased mood.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Move Action Tip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;When you are feeling stressed, get moving in a way that you enjoy — go for a walk, hit the gym, swim in the ocean, take a dance class, even housework can get your heart rate up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outside-In Approach: Change your environment to reduce stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Time in nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine, light and fresh air are nature’s way of helping us chill out and gain perspective. Time in nature helps to improve mood, reduce blood pressure and can increase our ability to concentrate. Exposure to daylight can also help us sleep better, as light regulates our natural wake and sleep cycle (circadian rhythm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have to be sun-wise (especially here in Australia!), getting some sunshine can make us feel better and improve our mood, thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680471&quot;&gt;mood-boosting effects of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480364&quot;&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, both of which increase with sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Nature Action Tip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Head outside to get some fresh and clear your head if you feel stress rising. Incorporate time in nature during your week to keep your stress in check —try a walk by the beach in the morning, a bushwalk on the weekend, watching a sunset or sunrise, spending time in the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Connecting with others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains are wired for connection. We are born as social animals and have a fundamental need for human warmth and connection, especially when we are stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we connect with friends and loved ones, the bonding hormone oxytocin is released in our brain. Oxytocin not only makes us feel good, but it also lowers our stress and counteracts the effects of cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Connection Action Tip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;While it can be hard to find the time (or mental energy) to socialise when we are feeling stressed, making time to have a coffee or dinner catch up with friends or family is an effective (and fun) way to take the pressure off and keep stress under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top-Down Approach: Change how you think to reduce stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mindfulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we fixate on a problem in the future or regret from the past, worry and rumination can take hold and cause stress and anxiety. Mindfulness practices train our brain to stay in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; have been seen to be effective in buffering against stress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; By bringing our attention back to the present moment, tuning in to our senses and using our breath to slow our heart rate, we can deactivate our stress response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Mindful Action Tip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Slow, deep-breathing exercises evoke the relaxation response. One useful way to practice deep breathing is to use the ‘box breathing’ technique: Breathe in for four seconds. Hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds. Then pause for four seconds before taking your next breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Re-think your stress response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we think about stress has a considerable effect on our body. In her TED talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en&quot;&gt;Make Stress Your Friend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;health psychologist Kelly McGonigal explains how the belief that stress is harmful is what makes stress unhealthy, not the stress itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative perception of stress causes the body to change in ways that have been linked to disease and a reduction in life expectancy. However, seeing the stress response as helpful and preparing us for the challenge ahead, can stop our body responding with further stress and making us unwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Re-thinking Action Tip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Next time you feel stressed, notice the symptoms of stress (the racing heart, the sweaty palms), and see if you can re-frame these sensations. Can you re-think the sensation of stress as the sensation of energy, excitement or anticipation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is something we all face and it can’t be avoided, and nor should we try. By working with the three core influencers of brain health, we can learn to ‘switch off’ our stress response and ‘switch on’ our relaxation response, promoting mental health and physical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A Swedish company called Emotra make a device to detect someone's risk of suicide based on measuring the body's autonomic responses to certain sounds. It's called EDOR®.



I've been blogging about this machine for the past 18 months (1, 2, 3) because such a product, if it worked, would be very important. It could help save countless lives. Unfortunately, I don't think EDOR® has been proven to be effective. As I've argued in my previous posts, the evidence just isn't there yet.

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Palm Beach County Students Compete in Max Planck Florida’s Brain Bee Challenge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait…&lt;em&gt;Zombies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about &lt;span&gt;learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Explaining Freud’s concept of the uncanny</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=141642</guid>
	<link>https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/600918064/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to his friend and biographer Ernest Jones, Sigmund Freud was fond regaling him with “strange or uncanny experiences with patients.” Freud had a “particular relish” for such stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019 marks the centenary of the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf&quot;&gt;Freud’s essay, “The ‘Uncanny”.&lt;/a&gt; Although much has been written on the essay during that time, Freud’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article/59/1/51/5085234&quot;&gt;concept of the uncanny &lt;/a&gt;is often not well understood. Typically, Freud’s theory of the uncanny is referred to under the heading of “the return of the repressed.” But Freud also offered another, more often overlooked, explanation for why we experience certain phenomena as uncanny. This has to do with the apparent confirmation of “surmounted primitive beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this theory, we all inherit, both from our individual and collective pasts, certain beliefs in animistic and magical phenomena—such as belief in the existence of spirits—which most of us, Freud thought, have largely, but not totally, surmounted. “As soon as something &lt;em&gt;actually happens&lt;/em&gt; in our lives,” Freud wrote, which seems to confirm a surmounted primitive belief, we get a feeling of the uncanny. Not only must the phenomenon be experienced as taking place in reality, however, it must also bring about uncertainty about what is real. As Freud put it, the phenomenon must bring about “a conflict of judgement as to whether things which been ‘surmounted’ and are regarded as incredible may not, after all, be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider some examples. Apparent acts of telepathy and precognition can appear to confirm belief in the omnipotence of thoughts. Waxworks and other highly lifelike human figures can appear to affirm belief in animism—the doctrine that everything is imbued with a living soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A remarkable illustration of Freud’s theory can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/stream/MemoriesDreamsReflectionsCarlJung/Memories,%20Dreams,%20Reflections%20-%20Carl%20Jung_djvu.txt&quot;&gt;Carl Jung’s autobiography&lt;/a&gt;. In 1909, during a meeting between Jung and Freud, Jung “had a curious sensation,” as if his “diaphragm were made of iron and were becoming red-hot—a glowing vault.” “And at that moment,” Jung wrote, there was such a “loud report” that came from the bookcase that was standing next to them that he and Freud “started up in alarm, fearing the thing was going to topple over.” Jung said to Freud: “There, that is an example of a so-called catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.” “Oh come,’” Freud replied. “That is sheer bosh.” “You are mistaken, Herr Professor,” said Jung. “And to prove my point, I now predict that in a moment there will be another such loud report!” Jung wrote that no sooner had said these words “than the same detonation went off in the bookcase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To this day I do not know what gave me this certainty.” Jung wrote. “But I knew beyond all doubt that the report would come again. Freud only stared aghast at me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Freud wrote a letter to Jung advising him to keep a “cool head.” Freud was first inclined “to ascribe some meaning” to the noise. But he subsequently made some investigations, and numerous times had observed the same noise coming from the bookcase, yet never in connection with his thoughts. “My credulity,” Freud wrote, “or at least my readiness to believe, vanished along with the spell of your personal presence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freud’s theory of surmounted primitive beliefs provides an explanation for why Freud experienced the sounding bookcase uncanny. It also provides an explanation for why the event had a different effect on Jung. For Freud causal connection between Jung’s thoughts and the noise was impossible. For Jung, it merely affirmed his belief in the reality of the “catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can this theory of Freud’s be used to explain all uncanny phenomena? This does not seem likely. For a start, one may have qualms about Freud’s characterisation of primitive beliefs. It also does not seem plausible that in order to experience something as uncanny one must first have held and then surmounted a belief in its reality. What if I had never believed in the existence of ghosts, does that mean I cannot experience a ghost-like apparition as uncanny?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can these problems with Freud’s theory be overcome? That is a task for another occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image credit: “Early morning in NZ” by Tobias Tullius.

Specifically, ketamine and its downstream actions are involved in the creation of new spines on dendrites, and in the formation of new synapses. But it turns out this is NOT linked to the rapid improvement in 'depressive' symptoms observed in a mouse model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mZ2LnuVB_s8/XLJs5qxB2oI/AAAAAAAAMz0/hIaaX94P8gM-N1K_50Sj30WgTLUS5W86QCLcBGAs/s1600/ketamine%2Bsynaptogenesis.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;436&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1290&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mZ2LnuVB_s8/XLJs5qxB2oI/AAAAAAAAMz0/hIaaX94P8gM-N1K_50Sj30WgTLUS5W86QCLcBGAs/s400/ketamine%2Bsynaptogenesis.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moda-Sava et al. (2019&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think we're still in the dark about why some humans can show immediate (albeit short-lived) relief from their unrelenting depression symptoms after ketamine infusion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moda-Sava et al.&lt;/a&gt; say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ketamine’s acute effects on depression-related behavior and circuit  function occur rapidly and &lt;u&gt;precede the onset of spine formation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which  in turn suggests that spine remodeling may be an activity-dependent  adaptation to changes in circuit function (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-83&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-83-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;83&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-88&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-88-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;88&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and is consistent with theoretical models implicating synaptic homeostasis mechanisms in depression and the stress response (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-89&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-89-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;89&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaat8078#ref-90&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-90-1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;90&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  Although not required for inducing ketamine’s effects acutely, these  newly formed spines are critical for sustaining the antidepressant  effect over time. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the problem is, depressed humans require constant treatment with ketamine to maintain any semblance of an effective clinical response, because the beneficial effect is fleeting. If we accept the possibility that ketamine acts through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mTOR&lt;/a&gt; signalling pathway, in the long run detrimental effects on the brain (and non-brain systems) may occur (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=ketamine+bladder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bladder damage&lt;/a&gt;, various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=mTOR+cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=psychosis+ketamine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychosis&lt;/a&gt;, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let's stay isolated in our silos, with our heads in the sand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/o_ceifero&quot;&gt;@o_ceifero&lt;/a&gt; for alerting me to this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/08/ketamine-for-depression-yay-or-neigh.html&quot;&gt;Ketamine for Depression: Yay or Neigh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/03/warning-about-ketamine-in-american.html&quot;&gt;Warning about Ketamine in the American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/chronic-ketamine-for-depression.html&quot;&gt;Chronic Ketamine for Depression: An Unethical Case Study?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/02/while-i-was-away.html&quot;&gt;still more on ketamine for depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/09/update-on-ketamine-in-palliative-care.html&quot;&gt;Update on Ketamine in Palliative Care Settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/03/07/ketamine-magic-antidepressant-or-expensive-illusion/&quot;&gt;Ketamine - Magic Antidepressant, or Expensive Illusion?&lt;/a&gt; - by Neuroskeptic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2013/05/27/fighting-depression-with-special-k/&quot;&gt;Fighting Depression with Special K&lt;/a&gt; - by Scicurious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/10/on-long-way-down-neurophenomenology-of.html&quot;&gt;On the Long Way Down: The Neurophenomenology of Ketamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moda-Sava RN, Murdock MH, Parekh PK, Fetcho RN, Huang BS, Huynh TN, Witztum J, Shaver DC, Rosenthal DL, Alway EJ, Lopez K, Meng Y, Nellissen L, Grosenick L, Milner TA, Deisseroth K, Bito H, Kasai H, Liston C.

	<description>The brain became a celebrity this week when Ariana Grande shared the results of a scan of her brain seemingly showing signs of severe PTSD:



Is there any science behind this?

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans. If it is an Amen scan, then the 'blobs' seen on Grande's brain represent areas of increased or decreased cerebral blood flow (C</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emil Dmitruk's journal club session, where he will present an overview of an EMG-CT method, while referencing various papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil will reference the following papers:&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporting on the scholarly publishing world can be a frustrating business these days, not just because the business model for journalism has all but collapsed but because scholarly publishers seem to be becoming increasingly reluctant to engage with reporters in a meaningful way, especially where the topic is open access. Their clear preference is to communicate by press release or managed events like webinars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s1600/SwatchSkinFront.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1028&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1116&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfBEiGwhcvI/XKNkJMGx9QI/AAAAAAAAkt4/hqC-7Hrb2CAlyKfhgJ_Z7QtHcNcYKN_QgCLcBGAs/s200/SwatchSkinFront.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, this has been the favoured model of commercial legacy publishers for quite some time now. The pity is that it appears to be becoming the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt; for non-profit OA publishers and OA initiatives too. Since the &lt;i&gt;raison d’être&lt;/i&gt; of OA is openness and transparency this is unfortunate. If nothing else, it smacks of hypocrisy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS has been guilty of this in the past – see for instance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/05/13/plos-stakeholders-and-shareholders/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from 2013. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On another occasion in 2011, when PLOS ONE published a controversial paper, I emailed a list of questions to the editorial director (after being invited to do so) only to later receive a message from the publisher saying that it had been decided not to respond to those questions. (As outlined in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/03/plos-one-open-access-and-future-of.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until recently, I had assumed that &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;at least was fully committed to openness. In 2016, for instance, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;posted details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of its publishing costs. But now I am not so sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will preface my further remarks by saying that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is a frequent publisher of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;press releases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and routinely emails me copies of them. In response, I am assiduous in posting details of these releases on social media. As I see it, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; and reporters like me is a two-way thing: I publicise their press releases; they answer my questions. Simples!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, it would seem &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; may not see it in the same way. Let me explain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Signalling something important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month, I was invited to take part in a press briefing webinar with the new &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; Editor-in-Chief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Eisen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who has replaced the founding EiC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randy Schekman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the briefing, practically all the questions posed by journalists were about business models and APCs. These did not seem to me to be questions best directed at an EiC, and in fact, Eisen had little to say in response other than that he believes APCs to be problematic and in any case the focus should be on achieving open access, not worrying about the details of business models. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In subsequently reflecting on the event it occurred to me that the appointment of Eisen is not simply the replacement of one EiC with another Rather, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is surely signalling something important about its future. So far as I am aware this point has not been made by &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; however, and it was not something explored in the press briefing, or indeed in subsequent reporting of the appointment (so far as I am aware).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe I am wrong, but that seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion to reach if one considers that Eisen’s OA advocacy in recent years has been almost exclusively focused on the need to move beyond the journal in favour of preprint archives and post-publication peer review, which is not what &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is about. As Eisen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;put it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a recent Reddit Q&amp;amp;A, “I would advocate doing away with ALL journals – not just for profit journals. The issue is that the idea of a journal as an entity that accepts or rejects papers and ‘publishes’ them is antiquated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eisen outlined his ideas on this in a post last year where he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;described&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; what he calls an APPRAISE system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has (so far as I am aware) always positioned itself as a high-quality OA competitor to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;. (I.e. a kind of OA mirror image of those journals). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, when pressed by its funders to become sustainable, &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;chose not to try something new and different, but simply emulated other publishers by introducing APCs (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$2,500 per article). It has yet to achieve sustainability, but in February the outgoing EiC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;appeared to indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the objective and approach remained the same, with sustainability expected to be achieved (in the next two or three years) by a doubling of the number of submissions to &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, this seems very different to Eisen’s view of the world. And that is why I am inclined to conclude that his appointment suggests that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is planning to reinvent itself. Either that or there is some kind of misalignment between &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; world view and that of its new EiC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is just speculation because, as far I am aware, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has not stated that it is planning to reinvent itself. Anyway, I was by now sufficiently intrigued that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; press officer contacted me after the briefing, I responded with some questions. And when it seemed that I was not making much progress that way, I suggested doing a formal Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; Executive Director Mark Patterson. I was told that he was happy to do this and so emailed over the list of questions below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, in a strange echo of my experience with PLOS, a week later I received an email saying, “We’ve reviewed the questions that you sent over, and there’s not much more that we’re able to add in response at this stage.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a subsequent email I was told, “The answers to the questions we have not already addressed will become clear in time, and we’ll be happy to share more information as it’s available. Having seen all your questions, it’s simply that we’re not prepared to answer them all right now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Out of sync?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I get that if &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is in the middle of a strategic review it might not want to provide detailed answers to one or two of my questions, but for Patterson not to answer any of the questions I sent below seems out of sync both with &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; claimed commitment to openness and transparency, and with the unspoken contract I believe should exist between organisations and those like me who report on them: I publicise their news and developments; they answer my questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Either way, I have to wonder why &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was not willing to answer some of the questions. Why, for instance, was it not prepared to say whether Eisen has ever had an EiC position before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, why seven months after the initiative was announced was &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;not prepared to share with me its views on Plan S, why was it not prepared to say how many APC waivers it is granting, and why was it not prepared to rehearse for me the results of the peer review trial it held last year? Why also was it not prepared to say whether it believes Read-and-Publish agreements will prove cheaper than the traditional Big Deal, and what impact these agreements might have on small publishers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More puzzlingly, why if he was unwilling to answer any of the questions I sent him did Patterson agree to do an interview in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is all the more baffling to me given that the day before &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; emailed to say it was not prepared to answer my questions, Eisen was introducing himself on Reddit by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that his objective is “to build a new ecosystem of scholarly publishing based not on journals, but on immediate, author-driven publication coupled with post-publication peer review and curation, and the role I envision &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; will play in this new ecosystem”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that Q&amp;amp;A he also said, “F1000Research isn’t, at least not yet, interested in doing anything beyond technical peer review of papers. They do an excellent job of this, but it’s a different problem than what I was thinking with APPRAISE, and now what I want to do at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, which is to help organize the literature, to help people find what’s interesting and important to them, and to help contextualize works for readers, and to help authors and people potentially interested in hiring, promoting or funding them to know what the community thinks of the quality and impact of their work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could not &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; have responded to my questions about its future strategy by at least saying something similar to that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Financial models?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting that the very &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise#comment-155&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;first question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; posted in response to Eisen’s outline of his APPRAISE idea was, “Fascinating stuff, but what’s the financial model here?” – a question to which Eisen did not respond. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, if the new strategy of &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; involves making APPRAISE a reality some kind of a financial modelling will be necessary, not least because if the publisher is still not sustainable and its funders expect it to become so in the next few years, it will presumably need to find additional resources from somewhere. In other words, while business models may not be something Eisen is concerned about, someone at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; needs to take an interest in them. It was partly in order to gain some understanding of this that I invited Patterson to do a formal Q&amp;amp;A. And I asked him specifically because as &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; Executive Director I assume that is his bag. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doubtless the open source &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/33e4127f/elife-introduces-libero-a-new-open-source-tool-for-publishing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Libero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; products that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is co-developing are relevant here too. And I was again puzzled that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was not prepared to answer my question about its open source activities even though it has been giving webinars on the topic (e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/f8226477/in-publishing-the-latest-on-the-open-source-publishing-platform-libero&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I can only conclude that while &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is happy to broadcast press releases and organise managed events, it is reluctant to answer specific questions from reporters outside of these managed events. A cynic might think that this is because reporters tend to ask probing questions – questions like, “Was that a wise decision you made?” and “Where is the business model here?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also worth pointing out that in the webinar linked above &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; &lt;u&gt;was&lt;/u&gt; asked about business models. The reply was that business models are not relevant to non-profits, which have only to achieve sustainability. This seems to me to miss the point that in order to achieve sustainability some kind of financial model is necessary – as Knowledge Unlatched &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;discovered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact is that regardless of any new development work Eisen might be hoping to see at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, 30% of its expenditures are already going towards “technology and innovation”. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has made it clear that Libero Publisher is being developed as a post-peer-review publishing platform, not some kind of preprint APPRAISE solution. If those authors (and/or their institutions) who are now having to pay &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; APCs find themselves having to subsidise a growing number of technology projects, they might start to feel a little aggrieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Presumably, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; hopes that at some point it will be able to earn revenue from providing software-as-a-service solutions around Libero – much as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public Knowledge Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; does with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Journal Systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; platform. The challenge, of course, is that developing new publishing workflow systems is neither easy nor cheap, as PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt;. True &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is sharing the load with third parties – but even so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post is about my personal disappointment with &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, but I believe there is a wider issue here: what I perceive to be a decreasing level of openness in the OA movement – an issue I have previously raised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I think we can see the same trend evident in the way in which Plan S was developed and proposed. But do not those who advocate for open access and greater transparency (which, we could note, they consistently demand of legacy publishers) have a responsibility to walk the talk themselves, not least by answering reporters’ questions? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, I await with interest to learn more about the future &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; sees for itself in the developing new world of scholarly communication, the role that its new EiC will play in this, and whether the task it set itself in 2012 is about to be recalibrated in a significant way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is just a shame that after appointing a new EiC &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; seems unwilling to answer questions about the significance of its choice, or even answer questions about current OA developments like Plan S and Read-and-Publish agreements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway, for the record, I am posting below the questions I sent to Patterson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Questions for Mark Patterson &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Eisen’s appointment as &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;’s new Editor-in-Chief is an interesting development. As I understand it, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; was founded in 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust as a high-quality open-access journal intended to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/infographic-how-is-elife-measuring-up&quot;&gt;compete with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;prestigious subscription journals like &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;. Its first Editor-in-Chief was the besuited, suave Nobel prize winner Randy Schekman. Eisen is the rumbustious T-short wearing co-founder of PLOS. It was PLOS that in 2003 pioneered use of the article-processing charge (APC) and it was PLOS that in 2006 launched PLOS ONE, which is committed to publishing any paper deemed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines&quot;&gt;technically rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;model has been characterised by some as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html&quot;&gt;bulk-publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Eisen is also a firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise&quot;&gt;advocate for preprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2017/10/q-with-plos-co-founder-michael-eisen.html&quot;&gt;said to me&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “We should all publish in bioRxiv and review papers outside of journals. It’s the only way forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This would seem to be a very different view of scholarly publishing to the one that has been espoused by &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; to date, and so must signal a change of direction for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. How would you characterise that new direction?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Has Mike Eisen ever worked as an Editor-in-Chief before?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; was wholly subsidised by funders for the first five years, but in 2017 it introduced an APC of $2,500. It has, however, yet to become sustainable. Doubtless, that is why during the press call that Eisen gave on March 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; all bar one of the questions asked by journalists were about business models and APCs. Responsibility for business models and financial matters at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is not in fact part of Eisen’s job description. Who is responsible to the &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; Board for business models, financial sustainability and strategy? You as Executive Director perhaps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When pushed on APCs during the press call Eisen said that he views them as problematic. He did not, however, propose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;any alternative way of funding &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, he said that since there is enough money in the current subscription system the research community should simply focus on achieving OA rather than worrying over the details of business models. All that is needed, he said, is to reallocate subscription money to pay for OA. Leaving aside the problem of how one does that, I am wondering if the claim holds up. One of the primary reasons why librarians have been calling for open access over the past 20-odd years is that they say they cannot afford the subscription model, which they believe to be unsustainable. Their assumption has always been that open access will be cheaper and so can solve their affordability problem. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated that OA is cheaper. Nevertheless, librarians continue to insist that they should pay publishers less money. One of the reasons UC gave for walking away from its negotiations with Elsevier recently, for instance, was that the publisher was not prepared to reduce what it charges the university. As Jeff MacKie-Mason &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/02/28/why-uc-split-with-publishing-giant-elsevier/&quot;&gt;has explained&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; UC set two goals when it began the negotiation: “a reduction in costs and default open access publication for UC authors”. At the same time, we could note that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/all-corporate-news/wiley-and-projekt-deal-partner-enhance-future-scholarly-research-an&quot;&gt;Wiley/Project DEAL Read-and-Publish agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is not expected to be any cheaper than a traditional Big Deal. Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think open access will reduce the costs of scholarly publishing? If not, will there not continue to be an unresolved problem in an OA world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As noted, despite introducing an APC, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; is still not sustainable. The funders supporting the publisher say they want it to do so in the near future. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; he gave to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; in February, Randy Schekman said, “The journal still receives income from charitable funders, as well as from article-processing charges. But we hope for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; to be self-sustaining within two or three years. The financial models we have drawn show that it can be done.” He added, “We believe that &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has the bandwidth to grow maybe two-fold in submissions — and if we do this, we can sustain ourselves without charitable funding.” Eisen seemed unaware of this financial modelling at the time of the press call. Can you say more about it? Is it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;enough (and even possible) to double submissions in the next two or three years? &lt;i&gt;eLife’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/50d52087/annual-report-looking-back-on-2017&quot;&gt;2017 annual report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicated that submissions fell after the introduction of an APC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that same report, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; said that around half of its submissions did not attract a fee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think this was partly because APCs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication&quot;&gt;introduced during the reporting period&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; does also offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#waiver&quot;&gt;waivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for “labs under financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or a lack of funding.” What percentage of the papers &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;is currently publishing are attracting a waiver, and how do you see this changing over time?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; operates a novel open and consultative peer review system. Last year it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2905802e/peer-review-elife-trials-a-new-approach&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;announced a trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to test the feasibility of what it called “a radical form of peer review” in which “once an editor has invited a manuscript for full peer review, the journal is committed to publishing the work along with the reviewer reports, the decision letter, and the author response.” Some initial results of that trial have been published &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/262c4c71/peer-review-first-results-from-a-trial-at-elife&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But how would you summarise these results and how do you envisage peer review developing in future, both at &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; and generally in scholarly publishing, particularly in light of the growing preprint movement and Eisen’s view that peer review ought to take place “outside of journals”?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I may have missed it, but I do not believe &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; has published a response to Plan S. I do know that when Schekman was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;asked about Plan S in February, he &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “I’m very supportive of this. Open access is the future. Commercial journals have been fighting against this very hard because it poses a clear danger to their profit margin … There will be a shakedown in the business. Some journals will lose out.” Is that &lt;i&gt;eLife’s &lt;/i&gt;official position? If not, what is its position?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the Project DEAL/ Wiley agreement, I am thinking that this model (and/or the Read-and-Publish &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;one) is likely to become the norm going forward, and I assume such deals will eventually be done with Elsevier. The problem for &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; I would think is that these are essentially new-style Big Deals, a model that inevitably favours large commercial legacy publishers and by its very nature tends to elbow aside small publishers like &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;. Unable to cut such deals with libraries, funders and/or consortia might it be that &lt;i&gt;eLife &lt;/i&gt;will be one of the journals to lose out (as Schekman puts it)? How can it best adapt to the kind of changes that initiatives like Plan S are likely to introduce?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;eLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; has been actively collaborating with third-parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (including the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coko.foundation/&quot;&gt;Coko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to build open source publishing solutions. Recently it announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/185e0679/elife-announces-first-release-of-open-source-submission-and-peer-review-platform-libero-reviewer&quot;&gt;Libero Reviewer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and it has been experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00724-7&quot;&gt;live-code articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Can you say something about these innovative initiatives and how they fit into &lt;i&gt;eLife’s&lt;/i&gt; strategy going forward?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There has been a lot of interest in the past couple of years in developing funder publishing platforms – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;primarily by using F1000 Research technology. More recently, we have seen Elsevier moving into this space too. For instance, it just announced that it has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/journals-published-by-arab-research-community-set-to-benefit-from-greater-global-visibility-809890046.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reached agreement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with the Association of Arab Universities to use its proprietary platform Digital Commons (bepress) to eventually publish 1,000 Arab journals. What does this tell us about the future of scholarly communication, and where does &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt; fit into this development? Does it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;span&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it that the topic of open access seems &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;only ever to be able to be discussed in terms of wide-eyed uncritical faith in “the cause”, or bad-tempered complaints about the kind of changes it is leading to – i.e. APCs, mandatory open access policies, predatory publishing etc. Can we ever expect to see a consensus over open access? If so, how?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Na Helian's journal club session, where she will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf&quot;&gt;OPTICS Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (Mihael Ankerst et al, 1999)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-datasets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to thedensity-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

After several weekends spent explaining your research in 10-minute segments to complete strangers, you’re hoping to ultimately have a place to call &lt;em&gt;lab&lt;/em&gt;, and a city to call &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you look back on your visits, it’s a whirlwind of graduate students, science, faculty members, walking, and beer. How, in Carl Sagan’s name, are you supposed to choose one school over another? To complicate such decisions, opaque ranking systems are putting dubious numerical values on your hodgepodge of memories and tired feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m no expert on choosing graduate schools or advisors — after all, I’ve only done it once. However, I’ve witnessed my colleagues disperse in all sorts of directions as far as institutions and advisors, some for better, and some for &lt;em&gt;ehh &lt;/em&gt;not so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*7HIduiCLF0tvZAuo.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you? &lt;/strong&gt;Before comparing programs, it’s a good idea to do some personal reflection. It’s impossible to know how you’ll feel at the end of graduate school, or even in a year, but your current decision depends on how you feel now. Check in with yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are you going to graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you see yourself doing after graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With those two answers in mind, how long would you like to spend in graduate school?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on prior work experience, consider the kind of leadership you work well with. Do you prefer supervisors to be hands-off, or very involved in your daily activities?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/&quot;&gt;this comprehensive survey&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by AAAS to help identify your needs, strengths, and weaknesses, as well your career options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, young reckless Jedi, ready are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you like the students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a major aspect of visiting the campus. Did you meet people you can see being scientifically as well as socially supportive? Were they, in general, pleasant? The emotional state of students (especially those past the third year) is incredibly indicative of the health of a graduate program. Think about the kind of people you want to be surrounded by for the next five years; even if the individuals change, the ethos of the program is unlikely to change that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All together now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science thrives in a collaborative and cohesive environment built on personalities that promote these characteristics. Ask students if they would feel comfortable asking another student in the program for experience or insight on a particular project or technique. In most of the places I’ve worked, people readily email around to borrow reagents or equipment and research moves quicker as a result. An institution that promotes collaboration across students and labs is likely to be a happier and better place to do science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure there are five advisors you can imagine yourself working with &lt;/strong&gt;(applicable for programs with research rotations).&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you’ve heard this already: do not choose an institution for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; star faculty member. Yes, you interviewed with them and the research is absolutely jaw dropping, but you should not depend on one person unless you have an explicit agreement with them or extensive prior experience with the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure there are 2–3 people you’re confident would be a good fit, with at least another 2 that you see as very strong possibilities. Reflect on your own goals for the type of research you hope to do (behind a computer or a lab bench?) and make sure the institution has several faculty members in each corner of your comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, compare your expectations for the length of your PhD to the program’s average as well as the labs that interest you. Some advisors regularly have graduate students for 7+ years, whereas others are known for graduating students much earlier. You might not mind sticking around for 7 years, but it’s a good thing to know in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask ahead of time about funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not coming in with your own funding, make sure the program will fund you for at least the first year. It is a very good sign if the program has &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants&quot;&gt;an institutional training grant&lt;/a&gt; (hint: you can search for your institution/organization on &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectreporter.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH RePORT&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about funding in a particular lab, it is definitely okay to ask if they will be able to fund you. Funding is a fact of life in science; the earlier you have those open conversations, the better off you’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is administrative infrastructure for student support.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want an administration that will help structure your experience in graduate school, elicit and implement your feedback, as well as springboard you into the next phase of your career. Graduate school can be quite amorphous without some structure; although this is okay for some students, it can be unmanageable for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some programs involve students on executive committees and schedule yearly feedback meetings. Not only does this demonstrate that the program cares, but also that it is organized enough internally to seek external advice. It’s definitely a plus if the department takes the time and money to plan seminar series and social events for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;about the science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you want to attend a university with an abundance of top-notch research, but you also need to be in a place where you can be a happy person. It is not shallow or unprofessional to choose a place where you think you’ll feel safe and at ease. You might decide that you’d prefer to be in a bustling city versus a quiet suburb, or in a place that offers cultural and social opportunities that fit your needs. You’ll spend long hours in the lab, but you also need long hours relaxing and doing things that you love, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/the-picnic-guidelines-re-written-1a8a9ef0841c&quot;&gt;having picnics&lt;/a&gt;. After all, your life outside of the lab enhances your ability to do good science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TtUmE7IrPaTvTrij3avIjA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;It’s totally reasonable to choose a program simply because of the presence of palm trees. Too far? Too far. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently making a choice between schools, don’t hesitate to ask additional questions of your host, other graduate students, or faculty you spoke to. This is your chance to gather as much information as you can so that you can feel confident in your decision. If they don’t answer your concerns, you may have your answer right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend a week pretending you’re going to one school. Take the next week and pretend you’re going to another school. Dwell on those indescribable responses to how it feels, remain open to unforeseen opportunities, and trust your intuition. As Richard Feynman aptly said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was originally posted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuwritesd.org/2014/03/20/you-interviewed-now-what/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NeuWriteSD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and has been edited to update its content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This post is the beginning of a conversation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “&lt;em&gt;So you want to be a neuroscientist? An honest account of life as a researcher” (Columbia University Press). &lt;/em&gt;The goal is to offer aspiring neuroscientists honest, informative insight about our field as well as education and careers in it. Most importantly, it will reflect the opinions and experience of our entire community — so, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback. What did I miss? What do you disagree with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/analog_ashley&quot;&gt;@analog_ashley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=54d81567247f&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/choosing-a-neuroscience-graduate-program-54d81567247f&quot;&gt;Choosing a neuroscience graduate program&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Our tools provide us with ever-greater  spatial resolution and ideal temporal resolution. But do we have the  right conceptual resolution? This conversation focuses on how we are  doing with this challenge, whether we have examples of successful  linking hypotheses between psychological and neurobiological accounts,  whether we are missing important ideas or tools, and where we might go  or should go, if all goes well. The conversation, in other words,  examines the very core of cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the schedule tomorrow is the public lecture and keynote address by Matt Walker &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cogneurosociety.org/keynote-address&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Sleep?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Can you recall the last time you woke up without an alarm clock feeling refreshed, not needing caffeine? If the answer is “no,” you are not alone. Two-thirds of adults fail to obtain the recommended 8 hours of nightly sleep. I doubt you are surprised by the answer to this question, but you may be surprised by the consequences. This talk will describe not only the good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don’t get enough. The presentation will focus on the brain (learning, memory aging, Alzheimer’s disease, education), but further highlight disease-related consequences in the body (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The take-home: sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset the health of our brains and bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why sleep, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://foals.co.uk/everythingnotsavedwillbelost&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foals&lt;/a&gt; are playing tonight at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefoxoakland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Fox Theater&lt;/a&gt; in Oakland.

Panel discussions that are too harmonious seem to be divisive. Some people will say, “well, now THAT wasn't very controversial.” But as I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/03/cns2019.html&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, one highlight of the 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/annual-meeting/&quot;&gt;Cognitive Neuroscience Society Annual Meeting&lt;/a&gt; was a Symposium organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psych.nyu.edu/poeppel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. David Poeppel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Session -&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience&quot;&gt;The Relation Between Psychology and Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, David Poeppel, Organizer, &lt;i&gt;Grand Ballroom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Whether we study single cells, measure populations of neurons,  characterize anatomical structure, or quantify BOLD, whether we collect  reaction times or construct computational models, it is a presupposition  of our field that we strive to bridge the neurosciences and the  psychological/cognitive sciences.

Not debate. So first, let me summarize the conversation. Then I'll get back to the merits (demerits) of debate. In brief, many of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BIG IDEAS&lt;/a&gt; motifs of 2017 were revisited...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Marr and the importance of work at all levels of analysis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;illustration of the three levels&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the “laws” that bridge these levels of analysis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complexityandsociety.com/files/4413/1692/0252/Emergence_as_a_Construct--History_and_Issues.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PDF&quot;&gt;Emergent properties&lt;/a&gt;” – a unique higher-level entity (e.g., consciousness, a flock of birds) emerges from the activity of lower-level activity (e.g., patterns of neuronal firing, the flight of individual birds)... the sum is greater than its parts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative Models – formal models that make computational predictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;...with interspersed meta-commentary on replication, publishing, and Advice to Young Neuroscientists. Without further ado:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. David Poeppel  – Introductory Remarks&lt;/b&gt; that &lt;i&gt;examined the very core of cognitive neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., “we have to face the music”).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the conceptual basis of cognitive neuroscience shouldn't be correlation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;For example, fronto-parietal network connectivity (as determined by resting state fMRI) is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;associated with &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;some cognitive function, but that doesn't mean it &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;causes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;explains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the behavior (or internal thought). We all know this, and we all know that “we must want more!” But we haven't the vaguest idea of how to relate complex psychological constructs such as attention, volition, and emotion to ongoing biological processes involving calcium channels, dendrites, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28093558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'Glutamatergic synapses are structurally and biochemically complex because of multiple plasticity processes: long-term potentiation, long-term depression, short-term potentiation and scaling.'&quot;&gt;glutamatergic synapses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;but what if the psychological and the biological are categorically dissimilar?? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In their 2003 book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Philosophical+Foundations+of+Neuroscience-p-9781405108386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bennett and Hacker warned that cognitive neuroscientists make the cardinal error of “...commit[ting] the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1389787/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;see this book review by David Schaal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mereological fallacy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  the tendency to ascribe to the brain psychological concepts that only  make sense when ascribed to whole animals.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognitive neuroscientists (&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;gasp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) are actually Cartesian dualists! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Philosophical+Foundations+of+Neuroscience-p-9781405108386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bennett and Hacker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“&lt;i&gt;For the characteristic form of explanation in contemporary cognitive  neuroscience consists in ascribing psychological attributes to the brain  and its parts in order to explain the possession of  psychological attributes and the exercise (and deficiencies in the  exercise) of cognitive powers by human beings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;” (p. 3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that optimistic note, the four panelists gave their introductory remarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/lila-davachi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Lila Davachi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; asked, “what is the value of the work we do?” Uh, well, that's a difficult question. Are we improving society in some way? Adding to a collective body of knowledge that may (or may not) be the key to explaining behavior and curing disease? Although still difficult, Dr. Davachi posed an easier question, “what are your goals?” To describe behavior, predict behavior (correlation), explain behavior (causation), change behavior (manipulation)? But “what counts as an explanation?” I don't think anyone really answered that question. Instead she mentioned the recurring themes of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;levels of analysis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;(without invoking Marr by name), &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;emergent properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (the flock of birds analogy), and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bridging laws&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (that link levels of analysis). The correct level of analysis is/are the one(s) that advance your goals. But what to do about “level chauvinism” in contemporary neuroscience? This question was raised again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Jennifer Groh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; jumped right out of the gate with this motif. There are competing narratives in neuroscience we can call the electrode level (recording from neurons) vs. the neuroimaging level (recording large-scale brain activations or “network” interactions based on an indirect measure of neural activity). They make different assumptions about what is significant or worth studying. I found this interesting, since her lab is the only one that records from actual neurons. But there are ever more reductionist scientists who always throw stones at those above them. Neurobiologists (at the electrode level and below) are operating at ever more granular levels of detail, walking away from cognitive neuroscience entirely (who wants to be a dualist, anyway?). I knew exactly where she was going with this: the field is being driven by techniques, doing experiments merely because you can (cough — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/subjects/optogenetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;HOW TO PUBLISH IN NATURE&quot;&gt;OPTOGENETICS&lt;/a&gt; — cough). Speaking for myself, however, the fact that neurobiologists can control mouse behavior by manipulating highly specific populations of cells raises the specter of insecurity... certain areas of research might not be considered “neuroscience” any more by a bulk of practitioners in the field (just attend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Society for Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(3) &lt;a href=&quot;http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/people/faculty.catherine-alexandra-hartley.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Catherine Hartley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; continued with the recurring theme that we need both &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;prediction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;explanation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to reach our ultimate goal of understanding behavior. Is a prediction system enough? No, we must know how the black box functions by studying “latent processes” such as representation and computation. But what if we're wrong about representations, I thought? The view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@PsychScientists&lt;/a&gt; immediately came to mind. Sorry to interrupt Dr. Hartley, but here's Golonka and Wilson in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/058925v3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecological Representations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mainstream cognitive science and neuroscience both rely heavily on the notion of representation in order to explain the full range of our behavioral repertoire. The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties ... While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called 'representation-hungry' problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on to invoke &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology#Gibson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James J Gibson's&lt;/a&gt; ecological information functions. But I can already hear Dr. Poeppel's colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GregoryHickok&quot;&gt;@GregoryHickok&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/568899227822252033&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;others on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; debating with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/733190148930850816&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@PsychScientists&lt;/a&gt;. Oh. Wait. Debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; that I so rudely interrupted, Dr. Hartley gave some excellent examples of theories that link psychology and neuroscience. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yorku.ca/eye/trichrom.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trichromatic theory of color vision&lt;/a&gt; — the finding that three independent channels convey color information — was based on psychophysics in the early-mid 1800s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young–Helmholtz theory&lt;/a&gt;). This was over a century before the discovery of cones in the retina, which are sensitive to three different wavelengths. She also mentioned the more frequently used examples of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Tolman/Maps/maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tolman's cognitive maps&lt;/a&gt; (which predated &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cognitivemap.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel&quot;&gt;The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by 30 years) and error-driven reinforcement learning (Bush–Mosteller [&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;6&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-23&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-23-2&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;7&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-24&quot; id=&quot;xref-ref-24-2&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] and Rescorla–Wagner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;both of which predate&lt;/a&gt; knowledge of dopamine neurons). To generate good linking hypotheses in the present, we need to construct formal models that make quantitative predictions (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;generative models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(4) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/sharon-thompson-schill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gave a brief introduction with no slides, which is good because this post has gotten very long. For this reason, I won't cover the panel discussion and the Q&amp;amp;A period, which continued the same themes outlined above and expanded on “predictivism” (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;predictive chauvinism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and data-driven neuroscience) and raised new points like the value (or not) of introspection in science. When the Cognitive Neuroscience Society updates their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg/videos&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, I'll let you know. Another source is the excellent live tweeting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2019&amp;amp;src=typd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@VukovicNikola&lt;/a&gt;. But to wrap up, Dr. Thompson-Schill asked members of the audience whether they consider themselves psychologists or neuroscientists. Most identified as neuroscientists (which is a relative term, I think). Although more people will talk to you on a plane if you say you're a psychologist, “neuroscience is easy, psychology is hard,” a surprising take-home message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debating Debates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've actually wanted to see more debating at the CNS meeting. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Society for the Neurobiology of Language&lt;/a&gt; (SNL) often features a lively debate at their conferences.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Several examples are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2016:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/2017/debate-2016/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Debate: The Consequences of Bilingualism for Cognitive and Neural Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen Bialystok &amp;amp; Manuel Carreiras &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2014:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20141116173834/http://www.neurolang.org/panelist-2014/&quot;&gt;What counts as neurobiology of language – a debate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Steve Small, Angela Friederici&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2013: &lt;/b&gt;Panel Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140118235112/http://www.neurolang.org/thursday-discussion-panel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The role of semantic information in reading aloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Coltheart vs Mark Seidenberg &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2012:&lt;/b&gt; Panel Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolang.org/2017/2012-sessions-events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;What is the role of the insula in speech and language?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina F.

On one side is Nancy Kanwisher of MIT, who first proposed that the fusiform gyrus was specifically designed to recognize faces–and faces alone–based on her findings using a magnetic resonance imaging device. Then, Isabel Gauthier, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt, talked about her research, showing that the fusiform gyrus lights up when looking at many different kinds of objects people are skilled at recognizing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for keeping this article on their site after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is the color-word Stroop task: name the font color, rather than read the word.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;BLUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; elicits conflict between the overlearned response (&quot;read the word &lt;i&gt;blue&lt;/i&gt;&quot;) and the task requirment (say &quot;&lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt;&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aka the  the now-obligatory David Poeppel session on BIG STUFF.

	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/10-brain-books-you-should-read-in-2019/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5858 size-large aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10brainbooks-1024x576.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s on your “to-read” list this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few books that I’ve read (or plan to in 2019) chosen based on research rigour, chosen, publication date (the last year or two) and practical application. In other words: these books synthesise the most compelling brain science and smart ideas emerging from the research lab and make it relevant for our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun exploring big topics like how our emotions are created, the importance of gut health, the latest on habit formation, understanding the teenage brain, epigenetics, mindfulness, depression and anxiety and the female brain. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Changer-Good-Mental-Health-ebook/dp/B07K9LZPNL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=brain+changer&amp;amp;qid=1551238192&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot;&gt;Brain Changer&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Felice Jacka&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is our brain and mental health affected by what we eat? Australian scientist, Felice Jacka uncovers the link between obesity and depression, how gut health impacts brain health and how a Mediterranean diet can keep our brains healthy as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Mindfulness-Astonishing-Science-Everyday-ebook/dp/B074FCMSJB&quot;&gt;The Neuroscience of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Stan Rodski&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the proof that mindfulness works? Discover the neuroscience behind mindfulness as Dr Rodski explains how being in the moment can lower stress, increase energy levels, build resilience and protect us from a range of life-threatening illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Brain-Gene-Psychotherapy-Integration-John-Arden/dp/0393711846&quot;&gt;Mind-Brain-Gene&lt;/a&gt; by Dr John Arden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Arden explores the fascinating world of epigenetics, the immune system and mental health. He takes us on a fascinating journey into the mind-brain-body feedback loops, showing how they influence mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Ourselves-Secret-Teenage-Brain/dp/1610397312/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3I2GBII41G4R7&amp;amp;keywords=sarah+jayne+blakemore&amp;amp;qid=1551238354&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=sarah+jayne+bl%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C363&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Inventing Ourselves&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakemore, often credited with pioneering adolescent neurosciences, takes us on a tour through the groundbreaking science behind the enigmatic, but crucial, brain developments of adolescence and how those translate into teenage behaviour. Blakemore demystifies this period of development, outlining what makes the teenage brain unique and why mental illness can develop in these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Connections-Uncovering-Depression-Unexpected/dp/163286830X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=johann+hari&amp;amp;qid=1551238458&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-2&quot;&gt;Lost Connections&lt;/a&gt; by Johann Hari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his bold and inspiring book, Hari goes on a quest to explore nine different causes of depression and anxiety including disconnection from meaningful work, other people, the natural world and hope. He challenges what we have believed to be true about depression and anxiety and their unexpected solution – reconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=james+clear&amp;amp;qid=1551238482&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/a&gt; by James Clear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we create habits that stick? In his book, Clear explores the neuroscience of habit formation, along with proven principles in biology and psychology to offer an effective system for change. According to Clear, it’s the small changes made consistently which compound into life-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Emotions-Made-Lisa-Barrett/dp/1328915433/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=How+Emotions+Are+Made&amp;amp;qid=1551238746&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;How Emotions Are Made&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrett shakes up what we have previously thought true about how emotions are created. She challenges the idea that emotions are automatic and hard-wired in certain parts of the brain, using the latest in emotion science to show how emotion is actually created from a complex interplay between our brain, body and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Classroom-Jared-Horvath/dp/1138649643/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=jared+horvath&amp;amp;qid=1551238526&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1-fkmrnull&quot;&gt;From the Laboratory to the Classroom&lt;/a&gt; by editors Jared Cooney Horvath, Jason M. Lodge and John Hattie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we applying what we know about the neuroscience of learning in the classroom? Horvath’s book combines theory and practice exceptionally well, offering useful strategies based on the science of learning, motivation, attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Every-Note-Played-Lisa-Genova/dp/147671780X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Q5DU80KX7ZID&amp;amp;keywords=lisa+genova&amp;amp;qid=1551238993&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=lisa+gen%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C371&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Every Note Ever Played&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Lisa Genova&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From neuroscientist and author of &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt;, Genova’s latest novel is compelling and thought-provoking. She explores what it means to be truly alive, looking at the way neurological conditions impact identity and relationships. Genova is gifted at bringing to life the struggles experienced by those living with a neurological condition and those who love and care for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Womens-Brain-Book-neuroscience-happiness/dp/073363852X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=womens+brain+book&amp;amp;qid=1551238336&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-2&quot;&gt;The Women’s Brain Book&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Sarah McKay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, how could I not include my own book on this list for must-reads of 2019! My book takes you on a journey through the female lifespan (from womb to tomb) and explores how how brains are shaped by the lives we live, and in turn how how lives are shaped by our neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any books I missed or you think should be added to the list?  Leave me a comment below. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: Making Space for Spirituality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.mariannebezaire.com/?p=193</guid>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/28/the-compatibility-of-stem-and-spirituality/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Having been raised Catholic, I have a confession to make: I have found it difficult to make room for spirituality and religion in a STEM-focused society. Not in my personal life exactly, but in my community and conversations. I think it’s partly because people have such varying conceptions of spiritual life, God, or gods. And because we don’t talk about it freely, when someone does bring up anything related to this subject, it’s easy to become immediately wary: is this person trying to convert me or take my money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a third option: what if that person is trying to tell you about a powerful experience they had, which they cannot fully explain using known, familiar concepts or which seems to be at least partly outside of human control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, for a lot of people, it’s actually something closer to this third idea that motivates us to talk about spirituality and God. And that may be the key to why it’s hard to discuss these things in certain STEM communities. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are about curiosity, innovation, achievement – rewarding for sure – but they are also often about control and precision, human definitions and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, if you need to know that something is conceptually possible with a certain regard for grace and beauty, you may be a mathematician. If you need to know something well enough to be confident that it will work reliably and consistently – and that you can fix it when it goes wrong – you might be an engineer or doctor. If you need to examine every little detail, control every factor and condition, and measure everything precisely and then report your findings in a strictly structured format, you are probably a hard scientist. Given each of these approaches to inquiry and the effect they may have on your world view, your conception of God is likely to be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also still feel that sense of wonder and awe that some folks ascribe to religion and spirituality. Except, instead of feeling that sense when you enter a religious venue or contemplate a starry sky, perhaps you feel that sense in the infinite combinations of factors that your experimental setup can produce. And I’m not speaking cynically of electrical noise or undetermined behavioral influences that plague experimental scientists. I mean the vast space of possibility associated with randomness, Brownian motion, genetic mutations and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that one acceptable definition of God to say God is in the things we don’t understand, in the concepts and people that we value but have not figured out. In this way, the concept of God is compatible with a fully formed and intricate understanding of biology, astronomy, natural history, and human relations. Being a generally warm-hearted and optimistic person, I also think of God as a force for love, growth, and connection between persons, nature, and other living things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the concept of God or spirituality, there is also the concept of religion: the specific ways in which we worship or view God. Sometimes it may seem that science and religion are incompatible, or are less compatible than science and spirituality. However, the domains of each are largely separate. To the extent that they overlap, it is worth exploring how each can benefit the other. For example, can science or medicine instruct us as to how to safely heal spiritual injuries? Or can religious traditions and rituals point us to some fundamental biological truth or natural observation? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/sunday/science-religion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Perhaps so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have actually experienced the healing of a spiritual injury in myself by someone with a scientific background. It had not been an experience I was expecting, nor one that I had even considered possible. But it happened and was a remarkable experience that felt very intense and difficult to describe to most people. After it happened, I felt quite strongly that something about my spiritual state had been altered. I have often contemplated the scientific basis for the sensations and feelings that occurred in me during this healing process. I do believe there are some, although I am unsure whether it is wise and necessary to delve far into the intricate details of my brain state, or whether that endeavor would be akin to chasing the biological basis for free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this post, I am becoming aware of just how little I discuss anything religious or spiritual. I feel that it is an awkward conversation to have, mostly because I assume everyone rushes to judgment about a religious speaker, as I do sometimes. I think the problem is also because I am out of practice discussing religion and spirituality. It is not a conversation that I hear or participate in often. I find myself hesitant to bring it up, not knowing where other people stand. And I feel uncomfortable to bring up a topic that almost no one else in my current environment discusses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy – and wrong – to pin my dilemma on my STEM community. This topic has been difficult for me to discuss even among members of my church community, people with whom I supposedly share a similar worldview, spiritual outlook, and religious foundation. In an article noting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/sunday/talk-god-sprituality-christian.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the difficulty of talking about God&lt;/a&gt; in this modern and busy world, author Jonathan Merritt observed that the decline in our spiritual vocabulary and proficiency has real consequences for the spiritual life of the community. Those consequences are negative and undesirable for the community, whether or not you believe in spiritual power or religion. And so, out of respect for the humanity and potential of our communities, I believe it is worth exploring how we can include a vocabulary of spirituality and religion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/vocation-college-higher-ed.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academia generally and STEM fields specifically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Newly Discovered Role for Climbing Fibers: Conveying a Sensory Snapshot to the Cerebellum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11918</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/newly-discovered-role-for-climbing-fibers-conveying-a-sensory-snapshot-to-the-cerebellum/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory enhancement is encoded in the presynaptic activity level of Climbing Fibers.&lt;/strong&gt; Comparison of the sensory enhancement of calcium event amplitudes in Climbing Fibers compared to observations in Purkinje cells, measured in separate experiments. The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing fiber is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: “I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined” – What it’s Really Like in MPFI’s PRE Program</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11910</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/blog/i-have-learned-much-more-than-i-would-have-ever-imagined-what-its-really-like-in-mpfis-pre-program/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp;amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Often times in academia, there is a tendency to branch out on more and more tangents. This can be a good thing, in terms of intellectual freedom, boundless creativity, fresh material for the continual grant application. However, it also seems to be a way of escaping accountability, of rendering academic research one giant project in busywork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of research if not to apply it (eventually)? Sometimes it is just fun to be curious and learn something that may someday be useful or is perhaps just interesting or fun to observe. But there are also many fields in which aimlessness is celebrated or encouraged. That is one of the beautiful parts of science, which can also allow for exciting discoveries to be made that later turn out to have highly significant effects. There are also fields in which abstraction or unapplicable revelations can stand on their own and are celebrated or mined for value: mathematics, philosophy, other arts and humanities are just as capable of producing this type of academic output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we get rather granular about the output of our field of research, the beauty and futility of it can become apparent and even coexist together. I had such an experience while working on my PhD project, a detailed computer model of a small part of the brain involved with memory. I wanted to base my model on the biology of the network as best I could. There were quite a few articles already published by anatomists, detailing the intricate studies done to count the numbers and types of neurons (brain cells) in that part of the brain. Those same scientists had also done meticulous work dying brain cells and characterizing their exact shape, size, and numbers of contacts with nearby cells. After sorting through all this published experimental data, which had taken years and years of work by dozens or hundreds of (mostly Hungarian) anatomists, I had a thought: what are we actually doing with this data? I wanted to use it to build a biologically realistic computer model, but might someone else want to use the data as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if someone else wanted the data too, might it be worthwhile to somehow collate the data into a usable format that incorporates as much similar data as possible into a single product that can be used for reference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing just that, in a project that I now refer to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sporadicsynapse.com/scientific-projects/quantitative-assessment/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quantitative assessment&lt;/a&gt;. This project then was able to form the basis for my larger research product, the detailed model and its resulting simulations. However, I also like the quantitative assessment on its own. I like how it makes use of the published literature, how it highlights and makes accessible a large body of mildly neglected facts that were gathered over years and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the work in the published literature seems to lie around untouched, gathering dust, so I am always excited to hear about applications, databases, large review-type projects, and other methods to integrate or apply published data. Without such initiatives, we risk turning academia and especially science into a closed-loop system that is inaccessible to the broader public and to human-relevant progress and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those concerns in mind, I was excited to stumble across a relatively new initiative by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that seeks to make use of the large body of published literature in the service of human health. The NIH’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dtr/adult-psychopathology-and-psychosocial-interventions-research-branch/computational-psychiatry-program.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Computational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; research funding initiative respects the significant amount of data available about psychiatric conditions and treatments, and it encourages scientists to apply algorithms to those information resources to multiple or exponentially increase their diagnostic and clinical value. It’s an example of a novel emphasis on existing literature that has a direct benefit to humankind in a relatively short time frame. In short, it’s an effective way of capitalizing on a large body of work already done, a smaller extra investment of time that can amplify the impact of the time already spent building the literature foundation for psychiatric conditions and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of psychiatric conditions has become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/preventing-mental-illness.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more sophisticated&lt;/a&gt; and respectful of the whole person, with the advent of concepts such as formulation (instead of diagnosis) and the greater appreciation for contribution of a person’s life experience to the state of their brain and mind. The new emphasis on computational psychiatry complements this growing interest while also harnessing the power of our expanding computational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
