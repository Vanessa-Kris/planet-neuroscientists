&lt;p&gt;In the first study of its kind, researchers have asked people to describe in their own words what it’s like to live with Avoidant Personality Disorder – a diagnosis defined by psychiatrists as “a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation”. Like all personality disorder diagnoses, AVPD is controversial, with some critics questioning whether it is anything other than an extreme form of social phobia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed new light on the issue, lead author Kristine D. Sørensena, a psychologist, twice interviewed 15 people receiving outpatient treatment for AVPD: 9 women, 6 men, with an average age of 33, and none of them in work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jclp.22740&quot;&gt;Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said the overarching theme to emerge from the in-depth interviews was the participants’ &lt;strong&gt;struggle to be a person&lt;/strong&gt;. “They felt safe when alone yet lost in their aloneness,” the researchers said. They “longed to connect with others yet feared to get close.” In the researchers’ opinion, the participants’ profound difficulties with their “core self” and in their dealings with others do indeed correspond to “a personality disorder diagnosis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36689&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneath the overarching theme of struggling to be a person, there emerged two main themes, the first being “&lt;strong&gt;fear and longing&lt;/strong&gt;“. This included participants’ descriptions of having to put on a mask when socialising and their difficulty feeling normal.  “&lt;em&gt;I notice that you spend incredible amounts of energy. You just spend your entire consciousness in just not … trying not to make a fool out of yourself and appear normal.&lt;/em&gt;” (Steve). This constant performance meant they felt other people never really knew them. “&lt;em&gt;I have never felt seen. Not even my mother knew me like that. I know I have missed it. I never felt loved.&lt;/em&gt;” (Lily). There were some rare exceptions to these difficulties. For instance, one participant said they felt authentic when with their young daughter, yet other participants described how, as their children grew older, their usual insecurities returned even when in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty that was mentioned repeatedly was the dread of getting close to others. “&lt;em&gt;I am very, very suspicious of people. Not that they would harm me physically, but what are their intentions? Or they seem nice, but really, they are not.&lt;/em&gt;” (Eva). Coping measures included only interacting through email or text message, and when in physical company, avoiding eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also described a conundrum – the solitude that brought them comfort and safety was also suffocating. They were “feeling sad, almost grieving when they were alone”, the researchers said. “&lt;em&gt;There comes a heaviness, like ‘now you are alone again little man, and you will never manage this; you will die alone’&lt;/em&gt;” (Peter). To cope, the participants said they kept busy playing computer games and listening to music. Most effective in this regard were physical sports and hobbies like making music, yet sadly the relief evaporated as soon as thoughts of being evaluated crept into mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second main theme was “&lt;strong&gt;A doubting self” – &lt;/strong&gt;including chronic insecurity and a fleeting sense of self. Participants had the perception that other people breeze through life and have no trouble being themselves. Related to this, the participants were constantly struggling to make sense of their own persistent insecurities. “&lt;em&gt;There is always something grinding in my head, so there is no rest. I do not know how to answer myself to make it better&lt;/em&gt;” (Anita).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constant acting and pretense when in company led to feelings “&lt;em&gt;like one is not even there&lt;/em&gt;” (Amanda). Sometimes this developed into an emotional hollowness. “&lt;em&gt;I think that it is real fun or should be, but I do not feel anything&lt;/em&gt;” (Eva). After wearing a mask for so many years, some participants feared they had forgotten who they truly were underneath. “&lt;em&gt;I feel like I do not know myself anymore&lt;/em&gt;” (Amanda). On the positive side, participants found time in nature was therapeutic, especially when immersed in a physical challenge. “&lt;em&gt;There it is only me. I do not have to perform something for others to see. I find enormous pleasure from reaching the mountaintop. Then, you are kind of free”&lt;/em&gt; (Elsa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the researchers said that their participants spend so much time “&lt;span&gt;reflecting on themselves that it seemingly disrupted their everyday life functioning”. They also lacked feelings of belonging, attachment and intimacy. Their suspicion of others and the burden of keeping up appearances “caused the participants to retreat from and thus miss social experiences that might have provided more trustworthy and comforting answers to questions related to the inner mental lives of themselves or others.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sørensena and her colleagues said these insights could be useful for therapists. The therapeutic alliance (a warm, trusting relationship between therapist and client) – always important – will be even more critical for clients with avoidant personality disorder. “The therapeutic relationship provides an opportunity for persons diagnosed with AVPD to experience being met with acceptance and understanding,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that “through a reflective process, patients might begin to make sense of why they do not manage what seems easy for most people. With this realization, their motivation to encounter new social learning might increase, together with a beginning of acceptance of life’s inherent uncertainties. Research on treatment of AVPD has been scarce and inconclusive, but the suggestions above do align with promising recommendations emphasizing the importance of social skills training and drawing on findings from social cognition research on mentalization, self‐other differentiation, interpersonal grounding for building a self‐concept, and affect consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Recruitment of pregnant women in randomized trials: What could hold us back?</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/belly-hospital-gown-small-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APOSTEL line of trials has covered APOSTEL I-VII so far. APOSTEL stands for ‘Assessment of Perinatal Outcome with [S….] Tocolysis in Early Labor’ – in this acronym the ‘S’ had different meanings in the different APOSTEL trials. These trials are summarized in Table 1. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2209-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most recent publication&lt;/a&gt; related to these trials describes stakeholders’ views on recruitment of pregnant women in randomized trials using data gathered during the APOSTEL VI trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of APOSTEL trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;height: 891px;&quot; width=&quot;1186&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APOSTEL trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Effectiveness of nifedipine in low-risk women with cervical length of 10-30 mm and negative fetal fibronectin test&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;Nifedipine is not effective in prolonging pregnancy in low-risk women; surprisingly, women in the nifedipine group had significantly lower gestational age births than women in the placebo group.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;II&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Effectiveness of maintenance tocolysis with nifedipine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;Maintenance tocolysis with nifedipine does not improve adverse neonatal outcome or prolongation of pregnancy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;III&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Effectiveness and safety of nifedipine and atosiban&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;Nifedipine and atosiban are equally effective with respect to adverse neonatal outcome. A non-significant higher mortality rate was present in the nifedipine group.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;IV&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Nifedipine in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;No differences in perinatal outcome and prolongation of pregnancy between nifedipine and placebo groups.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;VI&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Pessary versus no treatment in women with successful treatment of threatened preterm birth (not delivered after 48 hours tocolysis and corticosteroids)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;Pessary treatment is not effective in reducing adverse perinatal outcome.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;75&quot;&gt;V/VII&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;201&quot;&gt;Trials never started&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;336&quot;&gt;Other research groups already investigated the research topic upon completion of design of study.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 1. The APOSTEL trials performed to date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was thought that tocolytics improved perinatal outcome, since tocolytics could prolong pregnancy. However, in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no effectiveness of tocolytic therapy on perinatal outcome has been proven so far and that randomized placebo-controlled trials on this topic are urgently needed. Our project group completely agreed with this statement and believes that tocolytics should only be administered in routine care when it has been proven to be effective. Prolongation of pregnancy should not be the main goal of tocolytic therapy; the main goal should be improvement of perinatal outcome. Threatened preterm birth could be a sign of a problem within the uterine environment and therefore tocolytic therapy may be harmful by exposing the fetus longer to a suboptimal uterine environment. In several countries it is unusual to administer tocolytic therapy in threatened preterm birth in view of a possible harmful effect or lack of effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we designed the APOSTEL 8 trial, which is currently open for recruitment, to solve the question whether administration of tocolytic drugs improves neonatal outcome in cases of threatened preterm birth. This trial investigates the effectiveness of 48 hours of tocolytics with atosiban versus placebo in women with threatened preterm labor between 30 and 34 weeks. The standard treatment of corticosteroids is administered to all participants. They will be randomized to either 48 hours of atosiban or 48 hours of placebo. The choice for atosiban was made as no significant difference in effectiveness was present between nifedipine and atosiban in the APOSTEL III trial and because of the favorable safety profile of atosiban. In addition, it is registered for the indication of tocolysis in many countries in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status of APOSTEL 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10898&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10898&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/A8.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;APOSTEL#8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power analysis shows that we need to recruit 1514 participants in this study. All perinatal centers in the Netherlands will participate, together with many large secondary hospitals. Since several countries in Western Europe were interested in this trial, the APOSTEL 8 study will also be performed in the UK, Ireland and possibly Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, recruitment is slow due to a number of factors. Doctors are often too busy treating newly admitted patients to be able to take the time to invite them to participate in the trial and provide enough information. And even if there is sufficient time to explain the trial, the pregnant woman and her partner have to make a difficult and urgent decision whether to participate or not at a time which is very scary and insecure for them. To quickly introduce the trial to possible participants, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zorgevaluatienederland.nl/apostel8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;short animation video&lt;/a&gt; in which the dilemma on this topic and the necessity for this trial is explained. Furthermore, we approach doctors and midwives to raise awareness of their attitudes when it comes to recruitment of pregnant women for a randomized trial, as these may be hindering recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholders’ views on recruitment of pregnant women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, stakeholders involved in the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical research, such as bioethicists, researchers, and clinicians, have argued that research participation of pregnant women is essential in order to increase the evidence base for treatment of pregnant women and fetuses. In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2209-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;, we interviewed various stakeholders, including pregnant women themselves, in order to understand their opinions on including pregnant women in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, we made use of the APOSTEL trials in the Netherlands, specifically the APOSTEL VI study (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis revealed four themes that characterized stakeholders’ views on inclusion of pregnant women in the APOSTEL VI study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, pregnant women participated in the APOSTEL VI study primarily for potential individual benefit and secondarily for altruistic motives, as this quotation illustrates: &lt;em&gt;“I like to participate when it is positive for me, when participation makes me feel like I do something good, but that it is also positive for myself and that nothing can go wrong.” (pregnant woman, participating in APOSTEL VI) &lt;/em&gt;This finding is in contrast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-13-53&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hypothetical studies&lt;/a&gt;, where altruistic motives are usually mentioned as the primary reason for participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pregnant women may be willing to participate …, an underlying protective sentiment, resulting in gate-keeping and directive counselling, sometimes hampered recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a gate-keeping tendency hampered recruitment of pregnant women who might be eligible and willing.  Alarmingly, questions about pregnant women’s decision-making capacities sometimes surfaced, as demonstrated in this quotation&lt;em&gt;: “I think they [pregnant women] are behaviorally more vulnerable. I think they have some sort of black, blind spot: everything for the child. […] They are not sufficiently competent.” (gynecologist-in-training)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, healthcare professionals may have used the counselling conversation to steer pregnant women towards a particular decision, which was called counseling positive or counseling negative: &lt;em&gt;“Sometimes you know that it is not the right candidate. That it will be a mess. And then you counsel slightly more negatively.” (gynecologist-in-training)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, all stakeholders were hesitant about inclusion of pregnant women in clinical research in general due to a protective sentiment, although this related mostly to trials that are not pregnancy-specific and in which there are risks: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should not expose pregnant women to medications of which the effects on the baby are unknown, if you have an alternative. It’s different if it is pregnancy-specific. In that case you don’t have an alternative, and then I have fewer objections.” (Research Ethics Committee member and clinician)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these findings show us is that while pregnant women may be willing to participate for potential individual benefit and altruistic motives, an underlying protective sentiment, resulting in gate-keeping and directive counselling, sometimes hampered recruitment. These results apply to the APOSTEL VI study in particular, but it may be that these views have affected the recruitment in past trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve recruitment, it is therefore important to invest in educating and training of those involved in recruiting participants. This could be done by asking healthcare professionals to assess the logistics and potential risks and benefits of a study before discussing it with potential participants or by making stakeholders aware of their protective attitude and the resulting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>I just came across a paper with an interesting title: The Mutant Says in His Heart, “There Is No God”.

The conclusions of this work are even more interesting. According to the authors, Edward Dutton et al., humans evolved to be religious and atheism is caused (in part) by mutational damage to our normal, religious DNA. Atheists, in other words, are genetic degenerates.





Despite the talk of mutations, there is no genetics in this paper. No atheist genomes were sequenced and found to</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that teenagers’ moods go through drastic changes. In particular, depressive symptoms – like feelings of low mood or self-loathing – tend to increase as they grow older. Now researchers have plotted out the exact trajectory of these depressive symptoms. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0976-5&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Journal of Youth and Adolescence&lt;/i&gt;, Alex Kwong and colleagues from the University of Bristol report for the first time the points during teen development when symptoms increase most rapidly, on average – and they find that these timings differ between young men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36685&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of symptom increases is of more than theoretical interest. Having more serious depression symptoms in adolescence is a known risk factor for developing depression later on in life, suggesting it could be useful to intervene and treat symptoms when they are at their worst. But when is that exactly? Past research has shown that, on average, depressive symptoms peak at &lt;i&gt;some point&lt;/i&gt; in mid-to-late adolescence before decreasing again, but findings have been inconsistent: Scientists have suggested that peak depressive symptoms could occur as early as age 15 or as late as 20. And few studies have pinpointed other potentially important periods, such as the point at which depressive symptoms are increasing most rapidly, rather than simply when they have reached a peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better characterise these critical points, Kwong’s team examined data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. This study has been following children from birth in the 1990s through to today, providing an overview of development from childhood all the way through to adulthood.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team looked at participants’ scores on the short mood and feelings questionnaire from the ages of 10 to 22. This questionnaire measures depressive symptoms over the previous two weeks, asking participants to indicate whether statements like “I felt miserable or unhappy” are true for them. Over the 12 year time period, participants had been given the questionnaire on eight separate occasions (although not everyone had completed every questionnaire: 7,335 participants completed the first questionnaire, decreasing to 3,850 by the final one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers fit a model to this data, showing the path of depressive symptoms for each individual through adolescence and early adulthood. They then averaged these curves across males and females, to give the general trajectory for each sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that there were key differences between male and female participants. Females had higher depressive symptoms in general throughout their adolescence, except for between ages 10 and 11, when symptoms were higher for males. The symptoms didn’t peak until around age 20 for both sexes, but there were sex differences in the age at which symptoms increased most rapidly: for females this occurred at 13.7 years old, while for males it was much later, at 16.4 years old.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that these sex differences in the trajectories could relate partly to puberty. Girls generally go through puberty earlier, which could explain why their depressive symptoms increase most rapidly almost 3 years earlier than boys’ symptoms. This also suggests that girls could benefit earlier than boys from interventions designed to prevent the increase of depressive symptoms.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this study is the first to estimate the age at which depressive symptoms increase most rapidly, so the findings should be considered preliminary. It’s also not yet clear whether it’s possible to slow or reverse these rapid increases in teen depression symptoms – or what the later effects of doing so would be. Nevertheless, the authors say, “if this can be used for clinical purposes, it may be possible to treat individuals at this age, which may help reduce depressive symptoms or depression at a later stage.”&lt;/p&gt;

GenScript works with sponsors to determine the lead sequence after early research into developability assessment and pre-toxicity studies, and then enters the CMC stage to provide preclinical data for IND applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GenScript is capable of providing all the services involved in pre-IND studies, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stable cell line development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Process development of cell culture and purification&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality studies and method validation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formulation development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GMP pilot production&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bioassay development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PK/PD and toxicology studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average clone titer of a GenScript-produced mAb is 3-6 g/L with guaranteed 50+ generation clone stability. Process development is compliant with QbD concepts to optimize &lt;strong&gt;critical process parameters (CPPs)&lt;/strong&gt; and monitor critical quality attributes (CQAs) throughout the whole project to ensure robustness of cell culture and purification processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GenScript’s comprehensive analysis platform is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to fulfill the needs of quality studies for biomacromolecule characterization and process impurity analysis. In addition, cell-based bioassays have been established for many immune checkpoints and are customizable for client-specific targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The qualified CMC service supports the IND application under FDA, cFDA and EMA&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally, the entire CMC process requires 14-18 months, from gene to pre-IND phases. GenScript’s cGMP manufacturing capability will be available to meet the demand of Phase I trials (in 2019), and Phase II, Phase III and commercial production (in 2020-2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Within oncology research alone, more than 20 therapeutic antibody drugs received FDA approval for new treatments or indications during 2015 to 2017. Additionally, more than 300 therapeutic antibody drugs are in ongoing clinical trials. Most recently the success of cancer immunotherapy, by blocking immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, created a hope for a “cancer cure” and triggered a second revolution so that the majority of pharmaceutical companies are investing many research resources in antibody therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Amidst fierce competition together with many unmet medical needs, there is an urgent demand for new therapeutic strategies, such as combination therapy, and novel modalities, such as bispecific antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GenScript’s proprietary SMAB (single-domain antibody fused to monoclonal antibody) bispecific antibody platform&lt;/strong&gt; minimizes the immunogenicity and manufacturing concerns of current bispecific antibody platforms while enabling bivalent and multi-valent therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Major advantages of the SMAB platform include superior bioavailability and excellent developability for high yield and stability. Molecules generated on the SMAB platform have the ability to bind to hidden epitopes, such as enzymes and ion channels. Also, the platform is flexible enough to enable construction of multivalent molecules in a plug-and-play fashion. SMAB bispecific antibodies have demonstrated high efficacy and and high affinity to target cells in many models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build a new Biologics GMP Facility, GenScript has invested $75 million &lt;/strong&gt;to establish a modern biologics discovery, development, clinical and commercial manufacturing center in the city of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The Manufacturing Center is scheduled to come into use by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people find it easy to infer the emotional state underlying a scowl or beaming smile. But not all facial emotional signals are so obvious. Sensitivity to these less obvious emotional signals varies from one person to another and is a useful skill, improving relations with other people and benefiting psychological wellbeing. As well as varying between individuals, are there also shifts in this ability during a typical person’s life? And, if so, might these age-related changes be relevant to known high-risk periods for psychological problems and the onset of mental illness? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000559&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, provides some answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36680&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Rutter at Harvard Medical School and her colleagues analysed data on 9,190 people aged 10 to 85 from the US, the UK, Canada, India, Australia and Germany. These participants completed the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.testmybrain.org/tests/start&quot;&gt; Emotion Sensitivity test&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://testmybrain.org&quot;&gt;testmybrain.org&lt;/a&gt; website. They were shown 56 pairs of faces, and each time, they were asked which of the pair was “more angry”, “more happy”, or “more fearful”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The faces had been carefully manipulated so that the difficulty level in making these judgements was “easy”, “medium” or “hard”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that sensitivity to facial cues of anger increased steeply from age 10 to age 14, then increased at a slower rate until age 30, followed by a gradual decrease in sensitivity into late age. From an evolutionary perspective, the sharp rise in anger sensitivity through early to mid adolescence makes sense: “As adolescents are learning to navigate their social worlds, knowing if their actions are inciting anger in others is a particularly adaptive skill,” the team notes. Other work on adolescents in the UK found that while bullies didn’t differ from others in their emotion recognition skills, victims of bullying were less able to recognise anger and fear in particular. “Thus, learning to discriminate anger and change actions accordingly may serve an important social function,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear sensitivity showed a marked increase at around age 19, with a peak at about 34 years. It then remained relatively high until around 45–50, then reduced. Being able to spot fear in others is clearly useful for avoiding dangerous situations, and for protecting children from danger – but hyper-sensitivity to other people’s fear could play a role in the development of anxiety disorders. Agoraphobia, OCD, PTSD, panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27310233&quot;&gt;tend to develop&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of around 21 and 35, which is when the data indicated that sensitivity to fearful expressions rises, the team noted. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, happiness sensitivity showed a different lifespan pattern: after increasing between the ages of 10 and 22, there was “a very mild decline or plateau”, with sensitivity remaining relatively undimmed even into older age. The preservation of happiness sensitivity – combined with less awareness of other people’s anger and fear – may help to explain the results of studies finding that older adults (at least those with adequate social relationships) tend to report feeling happier more of the time than younger people.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted some possible gender differences: the data suggested that men’s anger sensitivity may continue to increase relatively steeply for a few more years, compared with women’s, and that their fear sensitivity improves more rapidly during adolescence, for example. However, these age-gender differences were not statistically significant.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations of the study: most notably the participants were self-selecting and so may not be representative of the general population. But the large sample size is an advantage. Overall, the data certainly suggests that sensitivities to different emotions don’t develop in the same way across the lifespan, and that this may be relevant to age-related changes in psychological wellbeing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: What Is Decidable About Low Dimensional Hybrid Systems?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2019-03-13:/2019/03/13/what-is-decidable-about-low-dimensional-hybrid-systems-.html</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olga Tveretina's journal club session, where she will present herself and Andrei Sandler's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hybrid system is a dynamic system that exhibits both continuous and discrete behaviour, and the number of its dimensions is determined by the number of the continuous variables. The hybrid system paradigm is a useful tool for describing a wide range of real-world applications. Examples come from robotics, avionics, biological networks, chemical processes, etc. Most of the hybrid systems are safety critical. Formally, verifying safety properties of hybrid systems consists of construction of a set of reachable states and checking whether this set intersects with a set of unsafe states. Therefore, one of the most fundamental problems in the analysis of hybrid systems is the reachability problem. The reachability problem is known for being difficult, and it is only decidable for special kinds of hybrid systems. Even though many attempts have been made to define the boundary between decidable and undecidable hybrid systems, it is far from being resolved. Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider defined some classes of low dimensional hybrid systems lying on the boundary between decidable and undecidable systems in their seminal paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0890540112000028/1-s2.0-S0890540112000028-main.pdf?_tid=9f466a86-e73b-4b4c-9dd9-84ef605373a7&amp;amp;acdnat=1552504249_aa972217ec2e75d11dcc518467361ca5&quot;&gt;Low dimensional hybrid systems – decidable, undecidable, don’t know (Asarin et al., 2012)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, and for which decidability is unknown. In this talk, Olga will present an overview of the area and discuss the recent work on the decidability of reachability for a class of hybrid systems due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider.&lt;/p&gt;

	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10907</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/03/13/bmc-molecular-and-cell-biology-one-journal-one-community-any-organism/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/bacteria-108895_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the re-launch of &lt;em&gt;BMC Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmolcellbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Molecular and Cell Biology, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;a broad scope, community journal for open-access molecular and cellular biology. We will make sure this is a wide-ranging, dynamic and visible journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Molecular and Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; is built on the firm foundations of its predecessor &lt;em&gt;BMC Cell Biology,  &lt;/em&gt;which was one the earliest BMC journals, launching in November 2000 and publishing its first article in the same year. For nearly 20 years this journal consistently published articles that are important to the community. We would like to take forward the key aspects of &lt;em&gt;BMC Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; – the importance of integrity in research, fairness to authors, and the evaluation of research without consideration of the impact – to the relaunched &lt;em&gt;BMC Molecular and Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, we are expanding the scope to cover that of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biochemistry&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BMC Structural Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BMC Biophysics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BMC Molecular Biology&lt;/em&gt;, and we are in the process of closing these journals. Our mission is to bring all members of the molecular and cellular biology community together, irrespective of organism or technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10909&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10909&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/cells-1872666_1920-300x150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Research using human cells and mammalian cells is vital for understanding disease.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research using human cells and mammalian cells is of course vital for understanding disease. These studies will always be important to the community, but we would especially like to welcome researchers who work on a broader range of cells – whether eukaryotic such as plants or yeast, or prokaryotic such as bacteria, viruses, or archaea.  There is a wealth of research and exciting insights being generated in many organisms and we would like to ensure these results are shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that understanding the molecular biology of a cell requires multiple techniques. Structural biology, for example, provides powerful insights into molecular mechanisms, but sometimes because of the technical nature of crystallography, NMR, or electron microscopy, these insights are not readily apparent. For &lt;em&gt;BMC Molecular and Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; we want to ensure that these results are understandable to other researchers. We wish to take a similar approach with other biophysical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journal has a board of highly motivated  external editors bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal has a board of highly motivated  external editors bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and experience. Researchers can now find a home for their manuscript in one of the following revamped sections;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Transcription and translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure and function of macromolecules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell cycle and cell division&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signalling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membrane processes/transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein folding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proteasome&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cell death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Molecular basis of disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to providing an excellent author service, in particular competitive turnaround times, but our top priority is publishing robust and reproducible science that is both open and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working with you in publishing good quality, scientifically valid research in this exciting addition to the &lt;em&gt;BMC series&lt;/em&gt; journal portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When it comes to the heated subject of differences between how men and women behave, debate in psychology has centered on mate preferences and general interests. The available research shows that when it comes to (heterosexual) mating preferences, men are relatively more interested in physical beauty, while women are relatively more interested in earning capacity. As for general interests, men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even the staunchest evolutionary psychologists would acknowledge these are partially overlapping bell curves: There are plenty of men who are fascinated by other people, and plenty of women looking for physical beauty in a partner above all else. Yet the findings have been met with fierce resistance in some quarters. One of the more sophisticated rejoinders is known as social roles theory: The differences &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;exist, but they’re entirely or largely the result of gender roles imposed by society on individuals. However, a new study released as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/mtsx8&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; at &lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt; and involving participants from 36 countries has failed to replicate a key finding that’s previously been cited in support of social roles theory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36662&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In its purest form social roles theory can be seen as sitting at the Nurture end of a Nature/Nurture spectrum, according to which sex differences in behaviour arise through cultural tradition. At the Nature end, on the other hand, are various evolutionary psychology accounts which posit that sex differences in behavior were carved into place by evolution. That is, since reproduction means such different things for men and women – men can pass along their genes at very little “cost,” while for women doing so entails gestation and childbirth at the very least – men and women have evolved different preferences for mates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the most noteworthy studies published in support of social roles theory came out in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in 1999. Alice H. Eagly and Wendy Wood reinterpreted data &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;originally published by the evolutionary psychologist David Buss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (showing average sex differences in mate preferences across cultures) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/545/docs/Wendy_Wood_Research_Articles/Evolutionary_Origins_of_Mens_and_Womens_Behavior/Eagly_Wood_1999_the_origins_of_human_sex_differences.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;reported that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in countries with more egalitarian gender relations, the male-female differences were smaller. This suggested that gender equality gives women room to pursue their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; romantic and sexual preferences, which aren’t all that far off from mens’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, for the new preprint, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Lingshan Zhang and Benedict Jones, and their colleagues at the University of Glasgow, have posed the exact same questions about mate preferences to a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; new sample (this one featuring 910 men and 2350 women from 36 countries, all of whom had ranked a number of traits in partners from most to least important, or rated those same traits numerically, or both) and their analysis casts serious doubt on the ability of social roles theory to explain these disparities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The authors explain that in “contrast with Eagly and Wood (1999), who used aggregated data to calculate sex-difference scores at the country level, we used multilevel models to analyze the mate preferences for individual participants,” and they point to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092392&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899065&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; which argue, in their words, that “the latter approach is preferable because it takes into account variability in preferences within each country.” (In all three studies – Buss; Eagly and Wood; and the new research – participants completed the same tasks, so it’s an apples-to-apples-to-apples comparison in that sense.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Zhang and his team found, as per their abstract, that “Although women preferred mates with good earning capacity more than men did and men preferred physically attractive mates more than women did, we found little evidence that these sex differences were smaller in countries with greater gender equality,” as defined by United Nations statistics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There was “one analysis [which] suggested that the sex difference in preferences for good earning capacity was smaller in countries with greater gender equality, [but] this effect was not significant when controlling for Galton’s problem or when correcting for multiple comparisons.” Galton’s problem is a statistical error that can occur when treating things as statistically independent that in fact aren’t – in this case, cultural practices in countries that are in close geographic proximity to one another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the end, after controlling for Galton’s problem, the researchers found just one mate characteristic that has been the subject of some evo-psych theorising – domestic skills like cooking and cleaning – for which the previously documented greater appeal to men than women effectively disappeared in more gender equal countries. Elsewhere, though, the differences were robust, both in the ranked- and rated-trait data, even controlling for gender equality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of how to interpret these new findings, Benedict Jones – co-author on the new preprint – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ben_C_J/status/1105775767332491264&quot;&gt;clarified on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “the work doesn’t rule out social roles playing a role in mate preferences” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ben_C_J/status/1105776379289837568&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; “we don’t provide any direct evidence for evolutionary explanations of mate preferences and some of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513818302368&quot;&gt;recent work&lt;/a&gt; has challenged them. It’s complicated!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, the new analyses match up, at least partially, with those of an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;important 2010 article published by Richard Lippa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, who asked a similar set of questions pertaining to sex differences in personality and interests. Summarising “two meta-analyses and three cross-cultural studies on gender differences in personality and interests,” Lippa found “small” to “moderate” sex differences with regard to Big Five personality traits, but “very large” ones with regard to the person–thing divide. “Gender differences in personality tend to be larger in gender-egalitarian societies than in gender-inegalitarian societies,” he found, “a finding that contradicts social role theory but is consistent with evolutionary, attributional, and social comparison theories. In contrast, gender differences in interests appear to be consistent across cultures and over time, a finding that suggests possible biologic influences.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At the very least, Lippa’s study and the new one from Zhang and Jones et al make it harder for advocates of social roles theory to explain what’s going on. If sex differences in mate attraction were as simple as “Men are conditioned to seek out attractive women, and women to seek out high-earning men,” one would expect gender equality to have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; effect on that dynamic. Nature and nurture surely intertwine and interact in myriad ways that humans may never fully disentangle, but for now these new results make it harder, as per Lippa, to rule out a strong role for “biologic influences.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/mtsx8&quot;&gt;Are sex differences in preferences for physical attractiveness and good earning capacity in potential mates smaller in countries with greater gender equality?&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been peer reviewed and the final version may differ from the one that this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;a mixed group of healthcare professional and business people meet around a conference table&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/iStock-872643060-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3671-z&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pragmatic guide to implementation science for clinicians and clinical researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation science can be defined as the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice. The necessary use of theory to inform implementation programs is recognized, but clinicians and researchers are often unfamiliar with these theories and behavioral change. Although they are interested in such approaches, clinicians and researchers find it difficult to navigate the expanding number of theories, frameworks, and models. In addition, they are often unfamiliar with the language as well as the inconsistencies in nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10863&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Overworked doctor doing paperwork&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10863 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/AdobeStock_150177913-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© baranq / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate article by Lynch&lt;em&gt; et al&lt;/em&gt; discusses the implementation of evidence-based practice in health care and can be used as a pragmatic guide to help clinicians and clinical researchers understand implementation theories, models and frameworks; what are they, how can they be used, and what prompts to consider when selecting a theoretical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3376-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bitter pill to swallow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health systems are pressured to deliver efficient, effective, and affordable care. Patient-related factors such as malnutrition, anemia, and delirium affect efficiency and affordability of health care by increasing the length of stay and cost per patient. Another symptom common in patients with complex medical conditions is difficulty in swallowing, also known as oropharyngeal dysphagia. Although dysphagia is a symptom of a range of critical head and neck conditions, it is often reported as a secondary measure, and as a result the associated resource utilization costs to treat this condition are inconsistently reported&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;overall expenditure measured via monetary cost increased by 40.36% in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systematic review by Attrill &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigated studies reporting on costs data and length of stay data related to oropharyngeal dysphagia. They report that dysphagia increases length of stay by nearly 3 days, and increases the health care costs per patient by more than 40%, suggesting that oropharyngeal dysphagia should be recognized as an important contributor to pressure on health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3145-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost benefit of rehabilitating tortured refugees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the recent surge of asylum seekers entering the European Union, questions have been raised about the ability of member states to integrate the newcomers into their societies and economy. This is particularly the case for individuals that have been subjected to torture. For torture is not only a socio-political phenomenon with severe psychological ramifications, it is also financially costly to society, in terms of both treatment and reduced productivity of the victim. In their study, Bager &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigate if rehabilitation of traumatized refugees is economically beneficial in long term economic and social perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10865&quot; style=&quot;width: 320px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mental health assessment&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10865 &quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Blog-on-treatment-of-torture-victims-300x202.jpg&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;@Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study describes a cost evaluation comprised of cost-utility analysis and partial cost-benefit analysis described for refugees treated at the &lt;em&gt;Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that productivity gains by family members lead to positive net social benefit after as little as 3 years, and these gains persisted over the study period. The authors suggest that multidisciplinary intervention to treat refugees provides “value-for-money” and is economically sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3455-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service user and carer involvement in mental health care safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They can make life very difficult, refuse to help you, and most likely change your diagnosis to personality disorder so that no one will want to treat you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient and carer involvement is a crucial tool to facilitate patient safety improvements. Despite serious failures in service provision, limited research has been carried out to identify these issues in the service provision of mental health care in the UK. Berzins &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; address these issues in their study, wherein they discuss mental health service users’ and carers’ experiences of raising concerns about safety in mental health care services, and their views on the potential for service user and carer involvement in future safety interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that mental health service users and carers experience great difficulties in raising concerns about the safety of these services. Reasons for not providing feedback on the services include unresponsiveness to complaints and fear of repercussions. The authors suggest that not collecting the user and carer feedback is a missed opportunity for learning and improvement of mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3615-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation strategy for health care interventions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of new interventions into complex health care environments can prove to be a problematic and complicated matter. Factors that may affect implementation include interoperability, cost, fit with existing systems, disruptions to interactions between medical personnel and service users, and poor implementation planning. Despite the complexity of the process of implementation, there is limited evidence on how to successfully implement new interventions into health care environments. The paper by Ross &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; provides an example of a successfully implemented digital health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10864&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brainstorming&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10864 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/AdobeStock_209260680-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© fotogestoeber / stock.adobe.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intervention described in this study is the HeLP-Diabetes digital self-management program for people with type 2 diabetes. To provide a learning opportunity, the authors describe strategies planned and employed as well as barriers encountered. The article may be of particular interest to people in the process of planning and executing implementation activities in health care services.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Gut microbiome patterns associated with post-surgery complication risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10901</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/03/12/gut-microbiome-patterns-associated-post-surgery-complication-risk/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/SPL_11960128-e1552393013256-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the constant improvement in operation techniques, intensive care and standardized antibiotic use, postoperative complications are still a significant problem in daily clinical practice. Knowing which patients are at the most risk of developing these is vital for achieving the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has changed our perception and understanding of the structure and function of the microbiome in various organ systems. The use of NGS allows new insights into the complex composition of the intestinal flora and its reaction to external influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to figure out if the gut microbiome experiences major changes in the perioperative setting, and if changes in bacterial diversity or composition might have an impact on the incidence of postoperative complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 116 stool samples of 32 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery using 16S-rRNA gene next-generation sequencing. Based on the structure of the gut microbiome, the samples could be allocated into three different microbial communities (A, B and C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10904&quot; style=&quot;width: 380px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10904&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of outcomes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition of community B was characterised, among others, by an increase in &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia &lt;/em&gt;that belongs to the &lt;em&gt;Verrucomicrobia &lt;/em&gt;phylum which degrade intestinal gut mucin as their sole carbon and nitrogen source. The mucin layer of the intestinal gut has an important function as it acts as a physical barrier to protect epithelial cells from pathogen invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments have shown a rise in mucin production, along with an increase in &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; in the gut microbiome under pro-inflammatory conditions and a protective effect on the epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraecae&lt;/em&gt; were decreased, normally associated with resistance against colonisation by more pathogenic bacteria including &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt;, which might indicate an increased susceptibility of the intestinal flora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly patients showing a microbial composition resembling community B at least once during the observation period were found to have a significantly higher risk for developing postoperative complications (e.g., anastomotic insufficiency or pancreatic fistula). Patients with a complicated course showed significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a higher leucocyte count, prolonged hospital stay and longer time in the intensive care unit (ICU). Six patients were treated with percutaneous drainage and two patients underwent re-operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that differences in the gut microbiome are associated with the development of postoperative complications. Thus, methods that take into account differences in the NGS-defined microbial communities might represent a useful diagnostic tool in future clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGS could improve our daily diagnostic procedures, especially in comparison to the mostly imprecise microbiologic culture based methods. But this requires clinical trials with large numbers of different patients with multiple diseases to evaluate which changes in the microbiome really need a therapeutic intervention and which are just a laboratory phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest temptations for psychologists is to report “marginally significant” research results. When statistical tests spit out values that are tantalisingly close to reaching significance, many just can’t help themselves.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619830326&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; has shown just how widespread this practice is. Anton Olsson-Collentine and colleagues from Tilburg University analysed three decades of psychology papers and found that a whopping 40 per cent of p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 – i.e. those &lt;i&gt;not significant&lt;/i&gt; according to conventional thresholds – were described by experimenters as “marginally significant”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36657&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists use p-values to gauge whether a result is statistically significant. The p-value &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/08/16/statistical-significance-explained-in-plain-english/&quot;&gt;provides an estimate&lt;/a&gt; of the likelihood of the current results (and others more extreme) being obtained if the “null hypothesis” were true. (The null hypothesis is that there is no effect, or no difference between the groups being studied). At a certain threshold – usually when &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;is less than 0.05 – psychologists dismiss the null hypothesis and infer that their result probably represents a true effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes researchers treat that threshold rather flexibly. If a p-value is a little greater than 0.05, they often report the result as “marginally significant”, implying that there could still be some kind of real effect going on.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine how often p-values are reported this way, Olsson-Collentine’s team examined the ways that values falling between 0.05 and 0.1 were described in journals published by the American Psychological Association from 1985 to 2016.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team programmed some code to go through 44,200 papers and extract 42,504 p-values falling between 0.05 and 0.1. They then searched the text immediately before and after the p-values for words beginning “margin” or “approach”, which could indicate that the results were being reported as marginally significant (or “approaching” significance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of the non-significant p-values they identified were reported as marginally significant. Of nine main psychology disciplines, the practice was most common in organisational psychology, where 45 per cent of values were deemed marginally significant, and least common in clinical psychology, where that number dropped to 30 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of reporting is a problem because it’s likely to contribute to false positives (the misattribution of null findings as true effects) and less reproducible research, say Olsson-Collentine and his colleagues. By calling a result “sort-of-significant”, psychologists are essentially changing the rules for what counts as significant after the fact, and therefore highlighting results that may be less likely to represent “true” effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there was some good news: across the 30 year period covered by the new analysis, the “marginally significant” habit seems to have become less common in most of the nine psychological sub-disciplines. “The downward trend in psychology overall may reflect increasing awareness among researchers that p values in the range of .05 to .10 represent weak evidence against the null,” write the researchers. It may also be the result of editors becoming stricter, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the new study only accounted for p-values described as “marginal” or “approaching” significance. But researchers can be much more inventive in the language they use. In 2013, statistician Matthew Hankins compiled a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/&quot;&gt;hundreds of other phrases&lt;/a&gt; psychological scientists have used to describe low-but-not-significant p-values in the literature, from “flirting with conventional levels of significance” to “very closely brushed the limit of statistical significance”. By missing some of the more creative ways that scientists try to squeeze positive results out of their work, it’s possible this new study is underestimating the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619830326&quot;&gt;The Prevalence of Marginally Significant Results in Psychology Over Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect usually triggers an eye-brow raise or two among even the most hard-nosed of skeptics. We may not be able to forecast the future or move physical objects with our minds, but the placebo effect is nearly as marvellous (Ben Goldacre once called it the “coolest, strangest thing in medicine”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “placebo effect” is short-hand for how our mere beliefs about the effectiveness of an inert treatment or intervention can lead to demonstrable health benefits and cognitive changes – an apparently incontrovertible demonstration of the near-magical power of mind over matter. &lt;span&gt;It’s not literally magic, of course. Our beliefs are the subjective echo of physical processes in the brain – and it’s this constellation of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3976&quot;&gt;neurochemical and electrical events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; , and their downstream effects, that underlies the placebo phenomenon (in some cases the placebo effect can also be interpreted as a form of conditioned response, in which a learned physiological reaction occurs in the absence of the original trigger).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another angle to this topic. To research psychologists, the placebo effect isn’t always a phenomenon of wonder, but a methodological nuisance. Researchers must go to extreme lengths to rule out the influence of participant expectations, so as to establish which observed effects are truly attributable to an intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, in a celebration of the mysterious and maddening placebo effect, and to help inspire future research into this most fascinating aspect of human (and animal) psychology, we digest 10 amazing placebo-related findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36630&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Works Even When You Know It’s A Placebo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the placebo effect to occur, it’s usually considered that deception is required – tricking the patient into thinking that an inert treatment is actually a powerful drug or similar. It’s this need for trickery that has long meant the deliberate inducement of placebo effects in mainstream medicine is seen as unethical. Nearly ten years ago, however, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015591&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that people with irritable bowel syndrome showed greater improvement after being given a so-called “open placebo” that they were told was completely inert, as compared to receiving no treatment. Presumably some residual belief and expectation of an effect survives being told that the treatment is physically impotent (or there is a condition response to the placebo that does not require positive beliefs). More recent research has since shown benefits of open placebos for many other conditions including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5113234/&quot;&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192758&quot;&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt;. Open placebos “bypass at least some of the conventional ethical barriers” to the clinical use of placebos, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774218300059&quot;&gt;according to some experts&lt;/a&gt;. Others however have &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jebm.12251&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; the lack of  suitably robust research in this area, and it’s worth noting there have been some null findings – for instance, open placebos failed to speed up &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/52/10/902/4825839&quot;&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branding, Colours and Medical Paraphernalia Can All Boost The Placebo Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside open placebos, there’s evidence that different forms of deceptive placebo vary in their effectiveness. The more powerful we imagine their effect will be, the larger the benefit. This means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014313/&quot;&gt;four placebo pills have a larger effect than two&lt;/a&gt;; and placebo injections (filled with nothing other than saline solution) are more powerful than pills (in fact, in the context of osteoarthritis, a placebo injection was &lt;a href=&quot;https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2398908/effectiveness-implications-alternative-placebo-treatments-systematic-review-network-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;found to be&lt;/a&gt; more effective than a real drug). Also – depending on the condition being treated – pills of certain colours and descriptions are more effective than others, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(72)90996-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;blue placebo pills making better sedatives than pink ones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/26/does-it-matter-whether-or-not-pain-medication-is-branded/&quot;&gt;branded placebo pills being more effective&lt;/a&gt; than those without any labelling. The influence of the credibility of a given placebo on its subsequent effectiveness may help explain one of the most astonishing demonstrations of the placebo effect that I’ve come across. It involved “placebo brain surgery” – and what could elicit a greater hope for a treatment effect than the elaborate paraphernalia and protocols involved in experts operating on your brain? Specifically, the research showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15066900&quot;&gt;patients with Parkinson’s Disease who undertook a form of placebo brain surgery (supposedly, but not really, involving the injection of stem cells) showed greater symptom improvements than those patients who received the stem cell treatment, but didn’t think they had.&lt;/a&gt; “The placebo effect was very strong in this study,” the researchers said, “demonstrating the value of placebo-controlled surgical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some People Are More Prone To The Placebo Effect Than Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain personality traits are associated with it being more likely that a person will experience the placebo effect. This is logical since the placebo effect depends on our beliefs and expectations, which some of us may subscribe to more readily and enthusiastically than others. Among the results in this area, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20627818&quot;&gt;optimists are more responsive to analgesic placebos&lt;/a&gt;, as are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/02/12/resilient-friendly-people-are-more-responsive-to-placebo-treatment/&quot;&gt;people who score higher for emotional resilience and friendliness&lt;/a&gt; (this last finding may relate to the social dynamic involved in the elicitation of the placebo effect by physicians). Curiously, the traits related to placebo response vary according to the condition being treated – in the context of stress, for instance, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399914000531#bb0035&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found it was the more pessimistic and less empathic participants who showed a greater placebo response. Whereas personality traits appear to play an important role in the placebo effect, the evidence to date suggests that age and gender are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427869?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;largely irrelevant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Doctors Are Better At Inducing The Placebo Effect Than Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As placebo effects depend on the patient believing in the power of the treatment being given to them, it follows that some doctors will be better placed to reinforce this hope and expectation than others. Research backs this up: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/27/the-placebo-effect-is-amplified-when-doctors-appear-likeable-and-competent/&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that involved a placebo injection for the treatment of an allergic reaction found that symptom improvement was greater when the injection was given by a doctor conveying warmth and confidence. Feelings of similarity toward one’s doctor may also be relevant: another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590751/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that subjective pain was lower after a medical procedure when participants thought they’d been paired with a doctor who shared the same values and personal beliefs as them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Isn’t Just About Pain Reduction – It Can Boost Creativity And Cognitive Performance Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually think of the placebo effect in the context of medical interventions and especially pain relief. However, there is growing evidence that the effect can also work in other ways, including enhancing our physical and mental performance. In terms athletic abilities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236983032_Placebo_Effects_in_Sport_and_Exercise_A_Meta-Analysis&quot;&gt;various studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown placebo effects on speed, strength and endurance (in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jsams.org/article/S1440-2440(07)00288-5/abstract&quot;&gt;placebo-like study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers asked cyclists to train to complete exhaustion and found they were able to persist significantly longer when their clocks had been secretly tampered with to make them run slow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relation to creativity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182466&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who smelt an odour that they were told boosts creativity went on to excel at tests of their creative performance as compared with a control group who smelled the same odour but weren’t told it had any special benefits. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35124-w&quot;&gt;Another experiment&lt;/a&gt; involved participants receiving placebo non-invasive brain stimulation and performing a learning task. The placebo group thought their brains had been stimulated by a mild electrical current – in reality they hadn’t – and they were led to believe that this stimulation would boost their mental function. The placebo participants were subsequently more accurate in the learning task, and showed steeper reductions in their reaction times than control participants. “We conclude that experimentally induced expectancy can impact cognitive functions of healthy adult participants,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s Even Such A Thing As Placebo Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is almost no end to the ways that the placebo phenomenon can manifest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/30/placebo-sleep-can-boost-your-mental-performance/&quot;&gt;In one particularly novel instance&lt;/a&gt; researchers tricked participants into thinking they’d had more sleep than they actually had, and then observed how this affected their performance the next day. The researchers achieved this deception by wiring their participants up to various physiological measures and then giving some of them false feedback on how much REM sleep they’d had. After hearing that they’d had an impressive amount of sleep, participants performed better on tests of language and arithmetic. Other imaginative examples and manifestations of the placebo effect include &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/04/16/is-the-benefit-of-exercise-a-placebo-effect/&quot;&gt;the study that showed&lt;/a&gt; health gains among hotel cleaning staff who had been reminded that their work counts as exercise, including in terms of weight, body mass index, body-fat, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/16/people-who-think-they-exercise-less-than-their-peers-die-earlier-regardless-of-their-actual-activity-levels/&quot;&gt;intriguing research finding&lt;/a&gt;, which might be explained by a kind of placebo effect, was that people who believe they exercise more than their peers tend to live longer, regardless of how much they actually exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animals Seem To Experience The Placebo Effect Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common in drug trials involving animals to compare an active treatment against a placebo, similar to the procedure in human drug trials. And when this is done, researchers have often observed that a significant number of animals in the placebo group show a treatment response, such as happened in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19912522&quot;&gt;a trial of an anti-seizure medication for dogs&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/7/2045S/4664828&quot;&gt;a dietary intervention for muscle stiffness in horses&lt;/a&gt;. The problem with interpreting these kind of findings is that it’s possible the placebo effect really lies with the owners, who may interact with their animals differently when they believe they are receiving medial care or nutritional supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the argument that animals can demonstrate a kind of placebo effect is irrefutable in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007477421830014X&quot;&gt;lab studies involving rodents&lt;/a&gt; – in this case, researchers have paired an active drug, such as morphine, with a particular taste or smell, and then shown that the analgesic effect still occurs when the same taste or smell is repeated but without the drug. In this case the placebo effect is arising from a conditioned response rather than the animals’ expectations, but this is probably part of the placebo phenomenon in humans too. As Edward Ernst &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161017-why-animals-experience-the-placebo-effect-much-like-we-do&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;BBC Earth&lt;/em&gt;: “A major chunk of what we believe constitutes the placebo effect has been in fact discovered in animals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Has An Evil Twin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the placebo effect occurs simply because you believe a given treatment will be beneficial, it follows that if you have negative expectations, this could result in a worsening of your symptoms. That’s exactly what researchers have found and they’ve called this the “nocebo effect”. The placebo effect’s twin is not to be sniffed at either. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262000564_The_magnitude_of_nocebo_effects_in_pain_A_meta-analysis&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the context of analgesia (in which some participants are told that an inert cream or pill leads to increased pain in some people) found that the nocebo effect is roughly similar in size to positive placebo effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, nocebo effects can even occur in the presence of real pain-relieving medications, not just inert treatments – in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21325618&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, participants were told that their pain would increase after an analgesia treatment was stopped. The physiological effect of the analgesia would normally persist, however in these participants it ended abruptly, as if the negative expectations had cancelled out the genuine analgesic effect. The real-life implications of these kind of findings are obvious – if nothing else, it’s probably worth taking care when you read the side-effects leaflet that came with your latest prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Is A Bit Of A Pain For Many Psychology Researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect is fascinating in its own right, but for researchers interested in establishing the efficacy of psychological interventions, it can be maddening. The influence of expectations on our thoughts, feelings and behavior is so powerful and pervasive that it complicates the interpretation of many studies, unless they are very carefully designed. In their 2013 paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691613491271&quot;&gt;The Pervasive Problem With Placebos In Psychology&lt;/a&gt;“, a team led by Walter Boot at Florida State University argued that in fact many psychology studies (on things like brain training, expressive writing and internet therapy) do not do enough to match participants’ expectations across different conditions. They explain that simply having an active control condition is not adequate if participants in the control group do not expect it to have as beneficial or powerful an effect as participants in the intervention condition expect of their experience. The way around this, Boot and his colleagues explained, is to measure participants’ expectations and take steps to try to match them across control and intervention conditions as much as possible. “‘We are hopeful that, with better designs and better checks on placebo effects, future research will provide more compelling evidence for the effectiveness of interventions,’ they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Appears To Be Getting Stronger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, it’s become apparent in recent years that the placebo effect is getting stronger – this has been shown for placebo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/4002136&quot;&gt;antipsychotic medications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910458?dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;holding=npg&quot;&gt;placebo anti-depressants&lt;/a&gt;, and – in the US only – for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307858&quot;&gt;placebo analgesics&lt;/a&gt;. With regards to that last finding, research team leader Jeffrey Mogil &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/strong-placebo-response-thwarts-painkiller-trials-1.18511&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We were absolutely floored when we found out”. Specifically, in the 90s, they found that participants receiving an active drug reported 27 per cent greater pain relief than participants receiving placebo, but by 2013, the difference was just 9 per cent. One explanation is that drug trials have become larger and more elaborate, especially in the US, thus increasing the drama and intensity of the experience for participants only receiving placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that the general public has become more aware of the placebo effect – and of the idea that its impact on symptoms can be real (as reflected in less pain-related brain activity, for instance) and not merely illusory. That was the argument put forward by anesthesiologist Gary Bennett &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/pain/Citation/2018/10000/Does_the_word__placebo__evoke_a_placebo_response_.5.aspx&quot;&gt;in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pain&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Bennett goes so far as to suggest that, because the term placebo now elicits such a strong placebo effect, its use should be dropped from drug trials. “The word ‘placebo’ should be avoided in all information and instructions given to the patients,” he advises. “Patient instructions should have the goal of forcing the patient’s expectations to the form: ‘I may receive pain relief’ vs. ‘I will not obtain pain relief’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However hard we try to control, conceal and comprehend the placebo effect, it looks certain it will continue to baffle and amaze us for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&quot;Foreign Accent Syndrome&quot; (FAS) is a rare disorder in which patients start to speak with a foreign or regional tone. This striking condition is often associated with brain damage, such as stroke. Presumably, the lesion affects the neural pathways by which the brain controls the tongue and vocal cords, thus producing a strange sounding speech.



Yet there may be more to FAS than meets the eye (or ear). According to a new paper  in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, many o</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Divide and conquer: Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10877</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/03/08/divide-and-conquer-colorectal-cancer/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating patients as individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has recently been an enormous effort into developing a better prognostic classification for bowel cancer in order to enable us to better select patients for treatment. By classifying patients into smaller groups, we can select patients most likely to respond to a certain type of therapy resulting in an increase in response rates and minimizing unwanted toxicities. This is known as a precision medicine approach and in itself is not a new concept. In breast cancer, grouping patients by tumor characteristics to select the most appropriate treatment has been happening since the late 1980s, and in the early 2000s four breast cancer subtypes were defined which are still used in the clinic today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there remains a need to identify characteristics within both the tumor and surrounding cells which may not only guide prognosis, but also provide novel targets for adjuvant therapies. It is now recognized that from a genetic standpoint, as with many cancer types, CRC is not just one disease, but a heterogeneous group of cancers that arise within the same organ. Therefore, given their prognostic value, the ability to subtype patient tumors in the routine pathology setting would enable optimal treatment allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10891&quot; style=&quot;width: 583px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10891&quot; height=&quot;239&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/HE-images.png&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Examples of Hematoxylin and eosin stain images required to classify immune subtype and stromal subtype.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making it simpler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently this approach has been adopted by CRC scientists and in 2015 the leading experts in this field proposed four consensus subtypes for CRC. However, these four subtypes are dependent on specialized genomic testing, making them difficult and expensive for the clinical community to adopt. Therefore, we (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/cancersciences/staff/joanneedwards/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edwards research group, Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center, University of Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;) have performed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305737217300646?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;review of the literature&lt;/a&gt; (doi:&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2017.04.006&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.ctrv.2017.04.006&lt;/a&gt;) to identify features of the tumor that are easier to assess and devised a simpler method of subtyping CRC tumors that can easily be performed in routine diagnostic laboratory using existing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtyping method we propose is based on immune infiltrate, stromal invasion, and proliferation rate, all of which can be readily translated into routine pathology and is called phenotypic subtypes. Phenotypic subtypes classify patients into immune, stromal, canonical and latent subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10892&quot; style=&quot;width: 583px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10892&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Examples-of-immunohistochemistry-.png&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Examples of immunohistochemistry required to assess proliferation rate and classify patients into canonical andlatent subtypes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenotypic subtyping method has been tested and validated in 3 retrospective different patient cohorts from across Europe (over 1000 patients) and a clinical trial cohort of almost 3000 patients. Excitingly not only can this subtyping method classify patients into different prognostic groups, but it is also associated with response to different chemotherapeutic regimens and therefore can be employed to identify which patient should receive which chemotherapy to maximize patient response and minimize patient’s toxicity. If this subtyping method can be incorporated into routine clinical practice it could revolutionize the treatment of patients, with different subtypes receiving different therapies. Currently we are working towards validating this within an international trial consortium (IDEA Trial) and if successful, we would then hope to test it in a prospective clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, two videos were released that shocked the world. They showed the beheadings, by ISIS, of two American journalists – first, James Foley and then Steven Sotloff. Though the videos were widely discussed on TV, print and online news, most outlets did not show the full footage. However, it was not difficult to find links to the videos online. At the time, Sarah Redmond at the University of California, Irvine and her colleagues were already a year into a longitudinal study to assess psychological responses to the Boston Marathon Bombing, which happened in April 2013. They realised that they could use the same nationally representative sample of US adults to investigate what kind of person &lt;i&gt;chooses &lt;/i&gt;to watch an ISIS beheading – and why. Their findings now appear in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-09638-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36639&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late spring 2013, the researchers had recruited 4,675 adults online, and assessed their mental health, TV-watching habits, demographics, political affiliation and religion. Six months later, the participants also reported on their fear of future terrorism and also on their lifetime exposure to violence. Then, between April and June 2015 – roughly eight months after the two ISIS beheading videos were released – 3,294 of the participants reported anonymously whether they had watched one of the videos either in its entirety, partly, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20 per cent reported watching part of one of the videos, and another 5 per cent said they’d watched at least one to the end. People in these groups were more likely to be male, Christian and unemployed, to watch more TV than average, and to have a higher lifetime experience of violence.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 3000 of the participants also agreed to write about their motivations for watching, stopping watching, or avoiding the videos altogether.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many who fully or partially watched the videos said that they wanted to gain information and verify that the videos existed, or wanted to satisfy their curiosity about what was in them. People who stopped watching part way through or who avoided the videos reported that they did so mostly for emotional reasons – (it was “too sad”, for example) – or because they didn’t want to feel that they were supporting ISIS by watching the footage.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after the participants gave these responses, they completed more online surveys, and the researchers found that those who’d watched at least part of a video had higher levels of distress and a greater fear of future negative events compared with those that hadn’t watched one. These relationships held after controlling for prior distress, lifetime exposure to violence and prior fear of negative events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal nature of the study – with important psychological data gathered well before the videos were released, as well as afterwards – gives the researchers’ confidence in their conclusion: that “watching graphic coverage may exacerbate preexisting fears and increase psychological symptomatology, demonstrating the negative psychological impact of viewing graphic media produced by terrorists.” As Redmond and her colleagues further note, the findings also imply that “watching such coverage may assist terrorists in achieving their goal of instilling fear.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research into why people watch gruesome or scary videos has focused on fictional material. To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore not only what percentage of people in the general population choose to watch videos of graphic real-life violence, but also why – and what the psychological effects might be.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work raises some important questions, not least: how should news programmes handle coverage of such horrific events? Running the beheading footage in full on a mainstream news channel would have been unthinkable. But was the storm of coverage alluding to the content really necessary? It may have prompted many people – especially those with pre-existing fears – to want to see the full footage for themselves, potentially worsening their anxiety, which, the researchers suggest, may have had the ironic effect of making them more likely to seek out other, similar kinds of distressing footage in future. Understanding how to prevent such a “spiral of fear” will be an important topic for further research in the area.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-09638-001&quot;&gt;Who watches an ISIS beheading—and why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re taught from an early age that it is polite and assertive to look people in the eyes when we’re talking to them. Psychology research backs this up – people who make plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/28/the-psychology-of-eye-contact-digested/&quot;&gt;eye contact&lt;/a&gt; – as long as it’s not excessive – are usually perceived as more competent, trustworthy and intelligent. If you want to make a good impression, then, it’s probably a good idea to meet the gaze of the person you’re talking to. However, following this advice is not necessarily straight-forward for everyone. It’s well-documented that mutual gaze can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190108-why-meeting-anothers-gaze-is-so-powerful&quot;&gt;emotionally intense and distracting&lt;/a&gt;, even uncomfortably so for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your experience, you may welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006619827486?journalCode=peca&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Perception&lt;/em&gt; that documents a phenomenon known as the “eye contact illusion” – put simply, we are not that good at telling whether an interlocutor is looking us in the eye or not. In fact, we tend to think they are, even when they’re not (a bias that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/&quot;&gt;magnified&lt;/a&gt; after we’ve been rejected). Thanks to this illusion, you can give the impression of making eye contact simply by ensuring you are looking in the general direction of your conversant’s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36618&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the eye contact illusion, one member of the Edith Cowan University research team, Oliver Guidetti, held 4-minute “getting to know you” chats with 46 male and female university students. Both Guidetti, and the students he chatted to, wore eye tracking glasses. For half the students, Guidetti made plenty of eye contact (around 77 per cent of the time, resulting in mutual eye contact during 52 per cent of the chat) just as he usually would. For the other students, he chatted in the same casual way, but deliberately reduced his eye contact to around 25 per cent, focusing more on the mouth region of their faces instead (resulting in mutual eye contact for just 3 per cent of the chat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical test was how much the students in the two groups believed Guidetti had tried to make eye contact and how much they enjoyed the chat. In fact both groups of students perceived the same amount of eye contact and enjoyed the chat the same amount. A follow-up experiment confirmed this wasn’t because the eye-tracking glasses made it hard to judge gaze direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, including lead author Shane Rogers, said their findings were consistent with past evidence suggesting that during normal conversation, the perception of eye contact is driven by the other person looking in the general direction of your face, not into your eyes specifically. The new findings may be reassuring to anyone who wants to be a good communicator but who finds eye contact uncomfortably intense. “Don’t get hung up on seeking out the eyes of the audience, just look more generally at their face, and let the eye contact illusion experienced by your partner do the work for you,” the researchers advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006619827486?journalCode=peca&quot;&gt;Contact Is in the Eye of the Beholder: The Eye Contact Illusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Better prediction of the economic burden of multimorbidity from medical and long-term care expenditures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=10872</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/03/07/better-prediction-of-the-economic-burden-of-multimorbidity-from-medical-and-long-term-care-expenditures/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/expeditures-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multimorbidity worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity, the coexistence of multiple chronic diseases in an individual, increases with age in older adults. Therefore, it is very common that older adults have more than one chronic medical problem at the same time, which impacts treatment for each of the conditions. Multimorbidity is a growing concern worldwide, especially in countries with aging populations. Numerous previous studies have reported that multimorbidity is associated with functional decline (i.e., older adults cannot take care of themselves in some aspects or more), decreased quality of life, and possibly even higher mortality, all of which are of concern to older adults and those who care for them. Aside from the burden on the individual from the conditions, there is also a societal burden from the costs associated with care for these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical and long-term care insurance systems and these expenditures in Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has a mandatory universal medical insurance system, established in 1961. It covers services provided by medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, various therapists), diagnostic tests, prescriptions, surgery, and anesthesia. In addition to the universal medical insurance system, Japan also launched a mandatory public long-term care insurance system in 2000. Those aged 65 years and older, as well as those aged between 40 and 64 years with specific aging-related diseases, are eligible for services. These include not only institutional care, whether long-term admission or short-term stay in a long-term care facility, but also community- and home-based care such as adult day care, outpatient rehabilitation, home help, or home-visit nursing. Long-term care insurance is also available in other countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic burden on society caused by multimorbidity could be better evaluated by the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures … providing a more-accurate assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steady increase in health-related spending has been a great concern in countries with aging populations. For example, in Japan in 2016, the annual medical expenditures were approximately US$372 billion and the annual long-term care expenditures were approximately US$88 billion. These figures represent 9% and 21% increases, respectively, over the past 5 years. These expenditures are projected to further increase with a rapidly aging society, both in Japan and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The associations between multimorbidity and expenditures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1057-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our recent study&lt;/a&gt;, we examined the associations between multimorbidity and the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures using medical and long-term care claims data from Kashiwa City, a suburb in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. It was already known that multimorbidity is associated with higher medical expenditures. We found that multimorbidity is also associated with higher long-term care expenditures, thereby increasing the sum of both types of expenditures. Our study further indicated that the economic burden on society caused by multimorbidity could be better evaluated by the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures than by medical expenditures alone, providing a more-accurate assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world and has not only medical but also long-term care insurance systems. As far as we know, this is the first study to examine the associations of multimorbidity with long-term care expenditures and with the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures, worldwide. As the steady increase in health-related spending has been a great threat for maintaining sustainable healthcare systems in many countries with aging populations, our results are meaningful not only for Japan but also globally. Effective strategies for reducing the prevalence of multimorbidity could provide not only medical and functional but also economic benefits for individuals and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims that violent video games lead to aggression have been around &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-26277-001&quot;&gt;since the days of &lt;i&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When young people are exposed to violent media, the theory goes, their aggressive thoughts become more prominent, leading them to commit acts of violence. But while several studies have found results that seem to back up this idea, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/18/hard-core-players-of-violent-video-games-do-not-have-emotionally-blunted-brains/&quot;&gt;evidence is far from unequivocal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a study published in &lt;i&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171474&quot;&gt;has failed to find any association&lt;/a&gt; between the time spent playing violent video games and aggressive behaviour, adding to a growing body of literature that suggests that such a link has been overstated – or may not exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36626&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many past studies in the field suffered from important methodological limitations, such as relying on people reporting their own levels of aggression, which opens results up to “mischievous responding”, where participants give dishonest responses just for the sake of it –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X14534297&quot;&gt;particular problem in research with young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more worryingly, researchers have often taken a “flexible” approach to analysis. For example, when calculating scores that represent the level of violence in games or how aggressive an individual is, researchers have decided to use just a small subset of all the questions that they’ve asked participants, allowing them to pick and choose from their measures to produce results consistent with their theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Andrew Przybylski and Netta Weinstein sought to examine the link between violent video games and aggression more rigorously, avoiding the methodological pitfalls of past work and sticking to an analysis plan they described before starting out the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair asked just over one thousand British 14- and 15-year-olds to list the games they had played in the past month, and how long they played them for. Rather than relying on the teenagers to describe whether these games were violent, the researchers checked whether or not each game contained violent content according to the European video game rating system, PEGI (of the more than 1,500 games participants listed, nearly two in three, such as &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, were rated as violent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure aggression, the researchers again avoided questioning the gamers directly. Instead, they asked the teenagers’ caregivers to complete a survey on the aggressive behaviours their child had shown over the past month, such as whether they had fought or bullied other children.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They also directly measured the teens’ “trait” levels of aggression, asking them the extent to which they felt that various statements characterised them (for example, “Given enough provocation, I may hit another person”). The researchers used this measure to control for baseline levels of aggression in the analysis.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Przybylski and Weinstein found that their participants played video games for two hours per day, on average, and almost 49 per cent of the girls and 68 per cent of the boys had played one or more violent games in the past month. But the amount of time they’d spent playing violent video games did not predict how aggressive they had been. These results remained the same when the researchers classified the games’ content on the American rather than European video game rating scale.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given on-going concerns from parents and policy-makers about the potential negative consequences of violent video games, a null finding from a large, carefully designed study should offer some reassurance. Of course, there’s always the possibility that gaming could be associated with other bad behaviour like bullying and trolling, and the authors say that these issues are worth further exploration. And while there are clearly benefits of having a third-party rate the teenagers’ aggression, it seems possible that some caregivers could still underplay or be unaware of their children’s aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also true that the new study is just the latest in a field containing many contradictory results. But it stands apart from many past papers because of its methodology. The paper was published as a Registered Report, a format in which a journal provisionally accepts a paper based on its protocol, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/were-offering-registered-reports-across-all-eleven-our-academic-journals&quot;&gt;regardless of how the results turn out&lt;/a&gt;. The authors show that it would have been possible – though statistically inappropriate – to fish around in their data until they had found a significant result somewhere. For example, there was a correlation between aggression and self-reported time spent playing games generally (a question that wasn’t part of the planned analysis). “If we had not preregistered our empirical approach and felt motivated to publish a positive result we might have seized on this correlation and made it the central focus of our research report,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when many experts believe unsubstantiated fears surrounding technology are obscuring legitimate and more nuanced questions about the role of media in society, it is promising that researchers are grappling with these important methodological issues. As the authors write, “it is crucial that scientists conduct work with openness and rigour if we are to build a real understanding of the positive and negative dynamics and impacts of technology in people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171474&quot;&gt;Violent video game engagement is not associated with adolescents’ aggressive behaviour: evidence from a registered report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Marianne Bezaire: Building a post-parent support system: why and how</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.mariannebezaire.com/?p=225</guid>
	<link>https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/05/building-a-post-parent-support-system-why-and-how/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Upon wishing my students a fruitful end to their college-application season, I thought back to that time in my own life. I began to consider what is really important for a successful college career versus what I thought would be important when I was applying to university. There are the things we assume will be key to our success: going to a prestigious school, picking a solid major with a clear career path associated with it, getting a good summer internship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are so many unknowns, which is one of the beautiful parts of going to university. The possibilities seem endless and it’s hard to top that feeling of unlimited potential that imbues the manicured landscape of your new home when you set foot on campus for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all those opportunities and unpredictability mean that you don’t really know if, a few years from now when you are lining up for commencement, you will be following your original dream or taking a different career path. You don’t know how long you will remain in your first career. Or what revelations or other life-altering experiences you may have during your college education, that could radically shift your values or priorities. Or what people or significant others you will hopefully meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these important and inevitable adventures aside, there is another aspect of university that we sometimes don’t consider consciously and deliberately, but that is just as important. Moving away from home is, for most of us, our first significant opportunity to be independent from our parents long enough to mature into a functioning adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambling through campus on any given day, the word “adult” can feel far away in time and atmosphere from college life. But it is already there on your personal horizon – the responsibility for keeping yourself healthy, the accountability to yourself and others to succeed in class and other activities. University is an opportunity to form and solidify your independent self with your own morals, values, and life outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a time when you’ll be introduced to hundreds of people with varying life outlooks, and when you will join or consort with a variety of groups and communities that have different values, social etiquette, and cultures. With all of this possibility and variability, chances are that at some point, the following will occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will fall short of your own expectations in a big way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will fall short of someone else’s expectations in a way that is significant to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone else will seriously disappoint your expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, you have an opportunity to compare your expectations, their expectations, and the stated expectations of your campus community. Questions may arise in your mind: were those expectations reasonable? Where did they come from? You can learn a lot about yourself, your culture, and your values from these experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the matter the unmet expectations themselves. These situations can be destabilizing, even traumatic. When they happen during your transition to adult independence, these occurrences can have an unhealthy effect on your outlook or personal growth if you don’t have the resources to process them and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an experience where I fell far short of my own expectations, and it haunted me for years afterward. What could have been an uncomfortable opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values instead became a nuisance burden of shame that I carried about, inhibiting my own conception of myself as a competent adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble began towards the end of my sophomore year. I had been serving as secretary of a student organization for the year and had put in my name to run for president of that organization the following year. It was one of those national organizations with student branches on most college campuses and it was affiliated with my major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I was running, the voting population of the organization was a bit ambiguous to me: was it the dues-paying members who made our activities possible, or was it the students of that major, for whom we designed and targeted our activities? If I had thought to read the bylaws of our student organization I would have found a good answer, but I didn’t. The outgoing president had a list of email addresses that he said corresponded to all the current students in the major. He would submit that list to the online election app so that all the students would have an opportunity to vote for the club’s next year of leadership, which is how the elections were usually run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a couple weeks before he was to submit the list, he made an offhand joke about padding the list with some extra emails to sway the election because so many of the upperclassmen had a problem with the person running against me and because he felt that she had bribed the freshman class by stopping by their morning lecture with a big box of donuts. I told him not to do that and he moved onto another topic of conversation. I thought it was a joke that I had heard the end of. It wasn’t until several weeks after the election that I found out he was serious. He announced in a leadership meeting that he had padded the vote and told us not to speak of it to anyone. When I asked how many votes he had added and found out that his padding was what won me the election, I was disappointed and ashamed. I felt personally responsible that he had done such a thing and that my voice seemed not to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my own reaction made the situation much worse. &lt;span&gt;My initial reaction was to feel unworthy of respect, given that he had already intentionally disrespected my stated value that he not interfere with the election and that he was now telling me to stay silent because my opinion still didn’t matter (to him). I felt ashamed of what he had done and afraid to discuss it with the faculty sponsor of our organization, who – from my isolated vantage point – seemed distant and uninterested. I had experienced some harassment over that school year and I became diffusely afraid of what would happen if I stuck up for myself by publicly ceding the election. And ashamed of being thought a troublemaker if I took time away from the faculty by asking them for advice on how to handle the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event could have been an opportunity for me to stand up for myself and my values, except that I couldn’t even get my own mind right. The other folks in my major just seemed relieved that my opponent had lost and my roommate seemed annoyed with me for even bringing up my problem. In retrospect, there were at least three ways that I could have personally resolved the moral dilemma and secured support for myself to weather any resulting criticism or harassment. But I didn’t know where to turn for the initial supportive brainstorming and discussion that I needed in order to act according to my idealized priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a support system in place, and so I didn’t get the benefit of this trial life threw my way. Instead, I served the next year as if I had won, except that I subordinated myself to the vice president (who had run as the mate of the student who should have won), figuring that he had more of a mandate than I did for how we allocated our money and time in service of the students. And I carried a little ball of shame during that year and after for becoming part of a corrupt situation by not speaking out. It was a cowardly response and therefore did nothing for my confidence or progression to becoming a responsible adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you ensure that you benefit from these trials as you navigate your college experience toward an adult self? By ensuring you have the resources and confidence to live according to your desired values. Create a multi-layered support and mentoring system for yourself that grows with your throughout your years in university. You can start right when you get to university by taking a few steps that I’ll outline in my next post. And every semester or year, you can take inventory of your support network and update it as needed. Watch for my next post, about creating your personal support system, and a follow up post about accessing support from the administrative resources provided by your university.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A well-known effect in psychology is that if you try to suppress a thought, ironically this can make the thought all the more salient – known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-11/thoughts-suppression&quot;&gt;rebound effect&lt;/a&gt;“. What are the implications of this effect for highly religious teenagers who have been taught to believe that sexual thoughts are taboo? Before now there has been little research on the rebound effect in this context, but in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1461796&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Sex Research&lt;/em&gt;, Yaniv Efrati at Beit Berl College, Kfar-Saba, Israel, presents evidence that the rebound effect could explain why orthodox Jewish teens have more compulsive sexual thoughts and fantasies than their secular peers. What’s more, his results suggest this mental dynamic might be responsible for the religious teens’ lower scores on self-reported wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36571&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three studies involved hundreds of secular Israeli teen volunteers, boys and girls aged 14 to 18, and a similar number of teen orthodox Jews of both sexes, who will have been taught by the religious text the &lt;em&gt;Talmud&lt;/em&gt; that “thoughts of transgression are more severe than transgression” – as well as receiving other decrees to avoid impure thoughts and masturbation – and therefore may have learned to try to conceal and suppress their sexual thoughts and feelings out of fear of shame and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to this prediction, Efrati found that the orthodox Jewish teens tended to score higher on a questionnaire measuring their frequency of compulsive sexual fantasies and thoughts (for example, they agreed more often with statements like “I feel like my sexual fantasises hurt those around me”). He also found that higher scorers on compulsive sexual thoughts tended to report being less happy, and this association explained why the orthodox Jewish teens tended to report being less happy than their secular peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final and most revealing study, Efrati linked the earlier findings with the rebound effect. Using a questionnaire measuring sexual suppression (an example item was “very often I find myself trying to suppress my sexual thoughts”), he found that Jewish orthodox teens engaged in more suppression of their sexual thoughts, and in turn this was linked with their having more compulsive sexual thoughts and fantasies, and also lower overall happiness (presumably because of the shame and guilt associated with the taboo thoughts, although they didn’t score any higher for depression or distress). Efrati said this result “corroborates with studies on the rebound effect in many other domains … and shows that suppression of sexual thoughts only begets higher pre-occupation with sexual thoughts and fantasies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are consistent with Efrati’s argument that the thought suppression rebound effect causes greater sexual thoughts among the religious teens, it’s important to note that the studies were purely correlational leaving them open to other interpretations. One alternative explanation, for instance, is to see everything in reverse – that the lower happiness among the Jewish orthodox teens (whatever is causing it) leads them to have more compulsive sexual thoughts, which triggers more attempts to suppress those thoughts. Even if Efrati’s interpretation is the correct one, it remains to be seen whether the same results will also apply among other religious groups besides orthodox Jews in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/oral-health-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0684-2&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consequences of community water fluoridation cessation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community water fluoridation (CWF), the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply, has been described by the Centers for Disease and Control as one of the most positively impactful public health achievements of the modern day. CWF was first implemented in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1945 and has since been employed across the United States and the wider world. CWF has been shown to significantly reduce childhood caries, the most common childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retrospective comparative analysis used dental claims records of 0-18 year old patients from Juneau (Alaksa) to explore the consequences of CWF cessation on dental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of CWF was confirmed by this investigation. The frequency of caries related procedures (particularly for 6-7 year olds) significantly increased during the fluoridation cessation period and there was an increase in the relative cost to treat the caries, suggesting an increase in caries severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CWF can be viewed as a kind of government investment which works towards protecting young people from childhood disease and school absences whilst simultaneously reducing government spending on healthcare claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0490-x&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reporting of child maltreatment amongst public dental health personnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, child maltreatment can come in the form of physical, sexual, psychological abuse, as well as generalized neglect. One quarter of adults worldwide were physically abused as children. Although abuse reporting continues to rise, an estimated third of victims of childhood sexual abuse cases go unreported. The importance of developing frameworks to detect potential hidden victims or at-risk children is immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeated missing of dental appointments is considered to be an early indicator of struggling households and possible maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Norway, all children below the age of 19 are provided with free and regular dental treatments from the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS). The PDHS are required by law to report suspicion of child maltreatment to the Child Welfare Services (CWS). The CWS is required to respond to PDHS maltreatment concerns within 3 weeks, unless the concern is unsubstantiated. When PDHS concerns result in CWS investigation, the reporter is provided with outcome information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1200 PDHS employees answered questionnaires regarding their reasons for sending a report to CWS and the responses the CWS gave.  The most common reason for sending a report of concern was if a child did not attend a dental visit, and not direct suspicion of neglect or interaction with parents/guardians. The repeated missing of dental appointments is considered to be an early indicator of struggling households and possible maltreatment. Grave caries and a lack of hygiene came 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; on the list, respectively. 40% of PDHS reports of suspicion of psychological abuse and trauma resulted in CWS investigation and measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of reports resulted in measures, but the PDHS was not aware of the outcome of a third of submitted reports. Sexual abuse, grave caries and suspicion of neglect were the most strongly associated with CWS led outcomes. Although the PDHS were shown to be efficient reporters of potential maltreatment, the relatively low measures taken by the CWS, and even feedback to the PDHS , highlights a gap between the two organisations that requires some work to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0591-6&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Using machine learning to predict bad breath from the mouth microbiome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral malodour, otherwise known as halistosis, chronically affects around 50% of the developed world. It can lead sufferers to experience low self-esteem and bullying. The molecular culprits are volatile sulphuric and acidic compounds produced by periodontis-associated oral bacteria. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) are produced by approximately 700 bacterial species residing in the human mouth. It is the concentration of the different compounds that each bacterial species produces, rather than presence of the species itself, which generates the resulting odour. For this reason it has been very difficult to establish a framework for predicting oral malodour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this problem, the authors turned to Deep Learning, a machine learning process which is inspired by the communication patterns seen within the neurons of the human brain.  Bacterial samples were taken from 90 patients, half with malodour and half without. Bacteria present in each sample were identified via 16s rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. This data, bacterial identity and the odour profile of individuals, was then sorted via deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10857&quot; style=&quot;width: 629px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10857 size-full&quot; height=&quot;477&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/cladogram.png&quot; width=&quot;619&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Cladogram created by the authors showing different abundance of mouth microbiome taxa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy breath was associated with an abundance of Streptococcus, Granulicatella and Rothia, and malodour was associated with Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, and Porphyromonas. The authors have provided evidence that saliva samples are a suitable substrate from which to assess oral malodour and have offered a potential deep learning based method in which the efficacy of malodour treatment can be measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0500-z&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The association between stress, saliva and dental caries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been much debate regarding the purported link between stress and the occurrence of dental caries. Stress can induce behavioural changes in people that can, in turn, be detrimental to oral health. A student’s tendency to increase sugar intake and neglect oral hygiene around exam time are examples of such behavioral changes. Stress can also induce flow rate changes in saliva. Behavioral and morphological changes collaborate to potentially increase the risk of dental caries amongst a stressed population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10859&quot; style=&quot;width: 970px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10859 size-full&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/stressed.jpg&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;source: pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scoping review, the authors performed a search in OVID, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and WoS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six studies, which used cortisol as the biomarker of stress, were included in the review. 4 of these studies identified a link between salivary cortisol and caries, and the remaining 2 did not. The authors do not concede a causative link between cortisol and caries; however they instead identify cortisol and caries as an oral health research gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding stress-induced salivary changes, the authors identify the limitation of the studies to have only measured acute stress responses instead of chronic stress exposure. The authors suggest the need for well designed, rigorous prospective cohort studies in which the extent that chronic stress (for example induced by low socio-economic status) effects caries is examined. The authors also suggest expanding cortisol-related measurements to more than just a single time-point (as seen in the examined studies) to better represent the complex factors contributing to human stress. The authors propose augmenting the measurement to also include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.     The source of stress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.     The subject’s perception of stress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.     Physiological stress responses, for instance heart rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that although evidence can be found to support links between stress and caries, the studies actually provide impetus for a pressing need for precise, detailed, methodologically sound studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0514-6&quot;&gt;Comparative effectiveness of school-based caries prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School-based caries prevention affords children greater access to dental care, and helps to homogenise the kind of care that children from different socio-economic backgrounds experience. School-based dental treatment involving the application of dental sealants is endorsed by The American Dental association. However, efficacy of such procedures has been identified as a knowledge gap and unexplored area of research by the Institute of Medicine (Washington, USA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the authors conducted a prospective observational study on 2 populations of children receiving school-based dental treatments. Both cohorts received glass ionomer sealants, but only one of the cohorts received a secondary intervention: interim therapeutic restorations placed on all asymptomatic teeth with carious lesions. Both interventions across both cohorts were performed every 6 months, and data was collected over the course of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding teeth, examination of any decay, missing, filled, sound or pulpal abnormalities were noted. Variables such as pain, swelling, infection and abscess were also recorded. Data was collected by the dental hygienists and dentists performing these procedures in an e-Case Report Forms, which were electronically collated and analysed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no statistically significant difference in the number of decayed or filled teeth across the cohorts. Interestingly however, there was a significant interaction between treatment and time, interpreted by the authors to mean that the incidence rate of decayed or filled teeth slowed over time for the children who received both primary and secondary interventions. This study offers important information to those involved in school-based optimal program design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now well known that many of us over-estimate our own brainpower. In one study, more than 90 per cent of US college professors famously claimed to be better than average at teaching, for instance – which would be highly unlikely. Our egos blind us to our own flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do we have an even more inflated view of our nearest and dearest? It seems we do – that’s the conclusion of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150&quot;&gt;new paper published in &lt;i&gt;Intelligence&lt;/i&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, which has shown that we consistently view our romantic partners as being much smarter than they really are.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36608&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, Gilles Gignac at the University of Western Australia and Marcin Zajenkowski at the University of Warsaw, also tested whether the couples’ actual IQs influenced their relationship satisfaction – with surprising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been some previous signs that we are especially optimistic about our loved ones’ attributes. When it comes to physical attractiveness, for instance, we tend to think that we have managed to attract someone who is even hotter than us – an effect sometimes called the “love is blind bias”. But past studies had failed to find a similar optimism for estimates of partners’ intelligence. Overall, people seemed to judge their partners’ intelligence as equal to their own – rather than thinking that they were especially clever.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the researchers recruited 218 heterosexual couples, who had been together for an average of six years, and around a quarter were married. Rather that guessing IQ scores – which might be confusing for participants who have little knowledge of IQ tests and their scoring – the participants had to estimate their own intelligence and their partner’s intelligence using a more intuitive, graphical scale (see below). The researchers then converted those estimates to IQ points according to the known statistical distribution of intelligence – the famous bell curve. To find the participants’ actual, objective IQ scores, the researchers also asked them to take a standard test of non-verbal intelligence known as the Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous research on individual overconfidence had found, most participants over-estimated their own intelligence by a huge margin – the equivalent of around 30 IQ points on average. Overall, only 0.9 per cent of women and 1.8 per cent of men assessed their own intelligence as being below average (even though 68.8 per cent of the women and 55.0 per cent of the men in this study scored below 100 – the mean IQ of the population as a whole).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ estimates of their partners’ intelligence were even more skewed. The men thought their wives and girlfriends’ IQs were around 36 points higher than they really were; the women thought their husbands and boyfriends’ IQs were 38 points higher than the reality. In other words, if you are like the majority of people in this sample, your partner is probably much less clever than you believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides this eye-catching result, Gignac and Zajenkowski’s paper is rich with other findings. They were interested, for instance, in whether people tend to hook up with someone of similar cognitive ability – and whether that “intellectual compatibility” is important for their happiness together. As previous research has found, there was a moderate correlation between the partners’ actual IQ scores – so in general people do seem to pick partners who roughly match their intelligence.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we have a slight preference for people with similar smarts to ourselves, or maybe it’s due to the fact that we have more opportunity to get romantically involved with people of roughly similar intelligence – in education or at work. Whatever the reasons, the degree of similarity of couples’ IQs didn’t seem to influence their relationship satisfaction – overall, couples with lower “intellectual compatibility” appeared to be just as happy as the couples who were more closely matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gignac and Zajenkowski also examined whether the men or the women in their sample were better at estimating their partners’ intelligence. According to some evolutionary psychologists, because the responsibility of pregnancy, childbirth, and usually childrearing, falls more directly on women, they should be pickier than men about the kind of person they choose to reproduce with. If true, it would make sense for women to have evolved to be more perceptive than men of differences in other people’s intelligence. Yet the researchers found no evidence of this.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers admit, there are some limitations to their study. They only used a non-verbal IQ test, for instance, and it’s possible you would see different results if you also looked at verbal questions. After all, the size of someone’s vocabulary and their linguistic fluency may be easier for a partner to judge accurately.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, the findings help extend our understanding of our self-serving biases, showing our egotism and self-confidence can sometimes spill-over to our loved ones. Maybe we like to think we’re with a partner who reflects an even better version of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150%23s0030&quot;&gt;People tend to overestimate their romantic partner’s intelligence even more than their own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Celebrate Open Data Day with Us!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8469</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/eCMuFBXT4t4/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/03/screenshot-3-1-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world tomorrow groups from all sectors will be celebrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendataday.org/&quot;&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt; – an annual event that highlights the benefits of open data and encourages the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society. As publishers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for the validation and foundation of new research and key to our mission to help researchers advance the scientific record. In the spirit of Open Data Day, we’ve decided to defer to researchers and data enthusiasts to answer the questions: why is data important and how can we make it better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got our answers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://prabakaran-group.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Sudhakaran Prabakaran&lt;/a&gt;, one of a number of dedicated volunteers at Cambridge University known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions&quot;&gt;Data Champions&lt;/a&gt; who are helping advise members of the research community on managing their data. Read his thoughts below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the Data Champions? What kinds of data questions do you help researchers navigate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think it’s a fantastic forum. [We have] a lot of discussions and people exchange ideas and not necessarily just in the sciences but also in every other field. [Data management] can be kind of confusing, even simple things like can I put my [datasets] in Dropbox? Can I share them in Google Drive? You’re talking about even labeling stuff in desktop computers. There is no clarity because this landscape is fast-moving and people are not trained to catch up with that kind of speed at which things change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you working on right now? How does open data play a role in it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our lab thrives on open data. We train machine learning algorithms that looks at specific regions of the human genome and trying to identify the most important mutations and then identify drugs to target them. Most of the datasets I work with people have already published and analyzed those datasets and they’ve extracted what they want. I’m kind of looking at things that they don’t want – I’m looking at non-coding regions, just kind of digging deeper into the datasets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think open data is important? What do you think the future open data landscape looks like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think open data is enough…it’s the analysis also. For example, we train a lot of machine learning algorithms and in the process we fail many, many times and we know the pitfalls we know what to avoid. But if you share that process with other people that will enable them to overcome it, to get there. It is very difficult and that process can be shared with people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think future young people are going to be brought up in an environment where they can just click something and get access to the code and get access to the data themselves. And then the issues of reproducibility would be mitigated if you can share what you’ve done and the data set is there for other people to work with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you give to authors and researchers to encourage them to share their data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think we have encountered these scenarios even as a data champion in my own department. I think if you if you have incentives, as in [getting] your DOI and authorships for the dataset even before publication then it’s easy to share. It’s your data, [someone] can probably do a different kind of analysis and publish it but they have to cite this data and you will be benefited by that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;And it’s in the best interest of the authors to share it ahead of time because of reproducibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to encourage good data management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can practice the open data lifestyle by sharing your research data in an open repository and making it available when you submit your manuscript. If you’re reviewing a submission, knowing how to evaluate the associated datasets can be tricky which is why we’ve worked with the Data Champions to cover everything you need to know in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Peer+Reviewing+Datasets.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewer’s Quick Guide to Assessing Datasets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If the manuscript you’re reviewing doesn’t have an associated dataset, request it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Data Champions Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Champions Programme is a network of volunteers who advise members of the research community on proper handling of research data. In this, they promote good research data management (RDM) and support Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/newsitem/?id=4615&quot;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt;) research principles. It is run by the Research Data Management Facility at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Ryohei Yasuda Receives $2.9M NIH Grant</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11878</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/ryohei-yasuda-receives-2-9m-nih-grant/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ryohei Yasuda of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has received a grant by the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH. The award is for $2.9 million over 5 years and will continue the funding of Yasuda’s work with Rab proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, Dr. Yasuda is studying Rab proteins’ impact on learning and memory by tracking how molecules become activated and interact with each other. By better understanding how these proteins communicate with each other, scientists may one day be able to develop interventions for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and other brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yasuda is a Scientific Director of MPFI and leads the Neuronal Signal Transduction Lab. He has received many recognitions for his outstanding research in neuroscience, including the 2015 National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Pioneer Award, which recognizes scientists demonstrating creativity and groundbreaking approaches in biomedical or behavioral science. Dr. Yasuda was one of only 13 scientists in the country to receive the NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional awards include the Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the New Investigator Award from the Alzheimer’s Association, and Research Award for Innovative Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yasuda received his PhD in Physics in 1998 from Keio University Graduate School of Science and Technology in Yokohama, Japan. In his PhD studies, he demonstrated that the enzyme ATP synthase is a rotary motor made of single molecule and that its energy conversion efficiency is close to 100%. From 2000 to 2005, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he built an imaging device to monitor protein interactions in living cells with high sensitivity and resolution. From 2005 to 2012, he was an assistant professor of the Neurobiology department at the Duke University Medical Center where he developed a number of techniques to visualize signaling activity in single synapses. From 2009 to 2012, Dr. Yasuda served as an Early Career Scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute before coming to MPFI in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Major disasters clearly take a toll on the survivors who had the misfortune to go through them. But there is another group of people who can suffer mental and physical distress from disasters: those who experience them second-hand, through media coverage and conversation. After 9/11, for example, researchers found an increase in symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002214650504600304&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-10485-003&quot;&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; among Americans who hadn’t directly experienced the terrorist attacks.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there have always been doubts about studies purporting to show evidence of vicarious distress. Because disasters occur randomly researchers are usually unable to gather data until weeks after the event, and they often have no record of people’s baseline mood before the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By chance a new study was able to overcome these limitations. When tragedy struck the Netherlands in 2014, there was a ready-made group of participants who were already recording their daily experiences. In May of that year, Bertus Jeronimus and colleagues at the University of Groningen had begun a crowd-sourced diary study called “HowNutsAreTheDutch” to examine mental health in the Netherlands. Three times per day for 30 days, participants completed questionnaires on their phones that measured their mood and recent activities.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months into the project, on 17 July 2014, Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 298 on board. One hundred and ninety-six of the victims were Dutch and the disaster received widespread attention in the Dutch media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their study published recently in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, Jeronimus and colleagues took advantage of this tragic twist of fate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12358&quot;&gt;examined the data&lt;/a&gt; gathered from 141 participants who were taking part around the time of the MH17 crash, to see how they were affected by their vicarious experience of the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36590&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team compared participants’ ratings of their mood and physical discomfort in the three days immediately following the crash with their average ratings earlier and later in the study. In each questionnaire, participants had rated themselves for six positive moods (e.g. energetic, cheerful) and six negative moods (e.g. irritable, tired). The questionnaires also measured the extent of general physical discomfort – for example, experience of symptoms like headaches or diarrhoea.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, in the three days after the crash the participants showed a higher level of negative emotion and a lower level of positive emotion, and also reported more physical discomfort. But although statistically significant these responses were pretty small: each rating scale ranged from 0 to 100, and the biggest effect (for physical discomfort) represented a change of just 2.78 points on this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at whether these changes were associated with aspects of participants’ personality like neuroticism and extraversion. These results were surprising: they had expected that people high in neuroticism, who worry and ruminate a lot, might be more affected by the crash – but in fact these participants tended to show &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; of a reduction in positive mood than people low in neuroticism. On the other hand, strong extraverts, who usually score higher on happiness and mood than introverts, tended to have a greater drop in mood than the quieter types.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors speculated that extraverts tend to socialise more and so could have spent more time talking about the disaster with others, precipitating a drop in their mood. High scorers on neuroticism, they suggested, might be more likely to respond to stress that directly involves themselves, rather than vicarious experiences.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality had no association with changes to negative mood, and overall the authors concluded that “broad personality domains are of little importance in predicting differences in vicarious exposure effects.” In this respect, age seemed more important: older participants tended to have less of an increase in negative emotions. Older people may have better strategies for coping with traumatic events, the author say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study was exploratory, it provides a rare insight into how indirect experience of disasters can affect the general population, albeit in small ways. But while the MH17 crash was a shocking event, it also occurred halfway across Europe and didn’t involve a continuing threat to the population of the Netherlands, which, the authors say, “may have allowed them to retain their sense of safety”. The effects of vicariously experiencing a more immediate disaster – and the importance of personality differences in this response – could be quite different.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
