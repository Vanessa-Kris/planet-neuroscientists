&lt;p&gt;There could be an Arctic blizzard blowing outside for all little Mary cares. The fact is, she’s hot from running around indoors, and no matter how much you try to explain to Mary that her future self – the one that’s about to go walking in the cold – would really appreciate that she put her coat on, Mary, like most kids aged under five, finds it very difficult to step outside of the present and consider her future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While psychologists have already spent a lot of time demonstrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/09/when-anticipating-their-future-needs-children-cant-see-past-their-current-state/&quot;&gt;the limitations of young children’s ability to plan for the future&lt;/a&gt;, until now they’ve not looked much at whether it’s possible to target these “prospective abilities”. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;amp;id=2017-09886-001&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has done that, showing that a mere five-minute chat about their recent past or future selves seems to help preschoolers remember to do things in the future, and to “time travel” mentally, so that they make better decisions about their forthcoming needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21849&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadia Chernyak at Boston University and her colleagues allocated 81 children, aged three to five, to one of four training conditions. Each child spent five minutes alone with a researcher talking and thinking about either: their self in the near past (for example, what they’d been doing earlier that day, and drawing a picture of themselves going to bed the previous night); their near future (such as what they would be doing later that day; drawing a picture of themselves going to bed that night); their distant future (such as in the coming weeks, and even when they are adult); or, finally, the present (including drawing a picture of what they were doing “right now”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they’d finished their training phase, a different researcher tested each child on their ability to make future-related decisions. Importantly, this researcher didn’t know which training condition each child had completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several tests, including a “prospective memory” challenge, which involved remembering to remind the researcher to open a box at the end of the tests; a “mental time travel” test that involved selecting appropriate items to take on a trek through the forest or snow; a “temporal discounting task” that gave the opportunity to forego a sticker “right now”, for the chance to have two at the end of the day; and a “saving task” that involved showing patience and waiting for a better play opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children who’d spent time thinking about their near-past or future outperformed the others (the children in the distant future and present training conditions) on the prospective memory task and on the mental time travel task. There were no group differences in performance on the temporal discounting task or saving task, perhaps because improvement in these skills takes practice as well as progress in conceptual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children in the near-past or future conditions had used more personal pronouns when chatting compared with the other children, and Chernyak and her colleagues think this offers a clue to why these conditions were apparently more beneficial to prospective memory and mental time travel. “Our work suggests that experience communicating and thinking about one’s extended self promotes the ability to make decisions on behalf of the extended self,” the researchers said. They added that children in the distant future condition may have found distant events and talk of their distant selves less self-relevant and more abstract (just as adults do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how long the apparent benefits of the near-past and future training conditions would last; ideally future studies would also provide some kind of before and after comparison of abilities rather than simply looking for between-group differences in ability after training. Nonetheless, the researchers believe they’ve highlighted an important principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results have implications for caregivers’ day-to-day interactions with preschoolers,” they concluded, “because even brief conversations with adults can help scaffold, shape, and activate concepts about one’s extended self. Critically engaging young children in conversations where they are provided with opportunities to cognitize, remember, and discuss their extended selves may ultimately help them make future-oriented decisions that benefit those extended selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;amp;id=2017-09886-001&quot;&gt;Training preschoolers’ prospective abilities through conversation about the extended self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?&quot;&gt;prodromal states&lt;/a&gt; have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, &lt;strike&gt;Frazier&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fraser et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DementiaBank&lt;/a&gt; database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using factor analysis, the researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four dimensions of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;were most indicative of dementia: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semantic impairment&lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;using overly simple words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acoustic impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;e.g., speaking more  slowly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntactic impairment  &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;using less complex grammar &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berisha et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; examined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantified linguistic features included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of unique words&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-specific nouns – e.g., &lt;i&gt;thing, something, anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filler words – &lt;i&gt;well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-imageability, high frequency verbs &lt;i&gt;– e.g., &lt;i&gt;get, give, go, have, do&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Reagan showed a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feb. 16 press conference&lt;/a&gt;, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Personality Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (NPD), as speculated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; grandiose status as POTUS): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing constant admiration from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pompous and arrogant demeanor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And we can call him &lt;b&gt;narcissistic&lt;/b&gt; in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;NY Times&lt;/i&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by 35 mental health professionals?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forcefully argued&lt;/a&gt; that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discourse Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is probably my favorite part so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called nuclear weapons  and other &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, lots of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with uranium,  including some bad &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Russia.  I've &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for Russia.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;train wreck&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!&lt;/b&gt; But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below). Letterman has aged too, so you might as well analyze his speech as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors performed... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...a 10-fold cross-validation procedure in which a unique 10% of the data (i.e., the ‘test set’) are used in each iteration for evaluation, and the remaining 90% (i.e., the ‘training set’) are used to select the most useful features (of the 370 available as described in “Features” above) and construct our models. The reported accuracy is an average across the 10 folds. In a given fold, data from any individual speaker can occur in the test set or the training set, but not both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A show-stopping limitation is that the two groups were not matched for age or education.

Five leading Early Career Researchers (ECRs) working in genetics, pathogens, virology and the intersection of medicine and policy shared their views with PLOS on Open Access, open data and communicating scientific results. Below are their responses that we hope will inspire and motivate ECRs in all disciplines. At the end of this post, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Chief Editor Larry Peiperl specifically responds to the importance of data sharing and publishing all valid results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When asked, “Do you and your colleagues discuss publishing in Open Access journals, or making data openly available?” these stellar scientists replied:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096788&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gymrek&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7456 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Gymrek2-1-300x185.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a computational group, we rely almost exclusively on publicly available datasets. &lt;/strong&gt;Making data openly available is critical to moving science forward, and it’s really frustrating that it is still far from ubiquitous. But I think we need to go even a step forward, and make all parts of publications, including the code and pipelines, easily available as well. I have been actively involved in discussions about why and how to do this. Luckily, I think the field of human genomics has been quite pioneering in moving toward a more “open” culture. Among my colleagues, it is just assumed that everyone puts their papers on preprint servers as soon as they’re submitted. We give people a hard time if their data is not available. Increasingly, software is getting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mgymrek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted on github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or similar repositories. Unfortunately, this is not the case in every field. —Melissa Gymrek, Assistant Professor, UC San Diego. Read Gymrek’s work in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096788&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004820&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cowardin&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-7458 &quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Cowardin2-271x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;244&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s incredibly important for data to be shared in a way that promotes collaboration and the advancement of knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; I think in general the more diverse ways you can examine a problem, or a data set, the more likely you are to reach surprising and meaningful conclusions. As biomedical researchers, our major goal should always be to improve human health, and open access seems to be an essential part of that effort. —Carrie Cowardin, Postdoctoral fellow, Washington University. Read Cowardin’s work in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004820&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making data openly available is an approach we highlight and discuss in our recent analysis of alternative mechanisms of research and development on our Re:route microsite.&lt;/strong&gt; Open data platforms are one way we can make biomedical R&amp;amp;D help more people, by increasing scientific discovery output, sharing negative results, increasing competition and decreasing the cost of medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. This model is already being used to some extent by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drugs for Neglected Diseases &lt;em&gt;initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (DND&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mmv.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicines for Malaria Venture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (MMV), among others. But it is not enough. This has to be implemented more broadly. —Gloria Tavera, President of the board, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines. Read Tavera’s work in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000635&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When asked, as one of the new generation of influencers in their respective fields, what changes do they foresee or would like to see related to the way research findings make their way to the greater scientific community, these innovators described preprints, linked data and code, the role of politics in the direction of scientific research and new forms of media as communication tools.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003701&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;He&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-7463 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;121&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/He2-300x121.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the many things I’d like to see in the future is to get the science spread to the general public more often.&lt;/strong&gt; As a scientist, we’ve more often just focused on exchanging our ideas or findings within our close circle, while the general public have little idea of what we are doing. I think it will be really great for the next generation of scientists to become better communicators, and try to bridge what we know to the others, and with the use of new forms of media, I am pretty sure there will be many endeavors taken pretty soon. —Jiang He, Postdoctoral fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Read He’s work in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003701&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121644&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Raj&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-7464 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Raj2-300x249.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If current trends continue, the most recent scientific developments will continue to be communicated to the greater scientific community digitally, through many different open access platforms. &lt;/strong&gt;The advantage is that this information can reach a wider audience than we could have ever imagined. However, we need to make sure that this dissemination mitigates sensationalism and only communicates good, accurate science. We will need well-trained science journalists and editors to lead these changes. —Srilakshmi Raj, Postdoctoral fellow, Cornell University. Read Raj’s work &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/2okMrQp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprints and open access will become the norm.&lt;/strong&gt;…I am particularly inspired by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/PubPolicy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ATGU’s eloquent publication policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. They sum it up: “We believe that it is only a matter of time before the concept of restricted access to the products of scientific research becomes an anachronism.” …In principle, a publication should include everything needed to reproduce the main findings of the study. That has to include software as well! I am frustrated with how many times I have to reinvent the wheel by redoing an analysis that was already done in another paper. My dream is that every figure, table, and result in a paper will be linked directly to the code and data used to produce them. —Melissa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We live in an interconnected world, and as technology advances, it becomes ever more pressing to share data openly and in an expedient way.&lt;/strong&gt; The methods put in place by the WHO for sharing data on Zika virus come to mind. It’s incredibly important to maintain the quality of work we do while improving our ability to share it with others, and part of that means timely publication of results. I also hope for more acceptance of negative data, which can be just as important to be aware of as interesting positive results. Better communication and recognition of negative results would make current research much more efficient and productive. —Carrie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; Chief Editor Larry Pieperl responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging data sharing became a priority for many during the West Africa Ebola outbreak 2-3 years ago. WHO called a consultation on data sharing and invited several journal editors to join the researchers and funding agencies for discussions in Geneva. The evidence presented there included an analysis that showed most of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000272&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research from the 2003 SARS outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were not even submitted for publication until after the crisis was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some people had the idea that editors presented a barrier by refusing to publish research if the data had been previously shared, and wanted us to account for ourselves. What happened may have surprised them: journal editors had no problem &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001949&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endorsing data sharing in public health emergencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This statement of editorial policy turned out to be timely, as the first studies on Zika came soon after, and data sharing quickly became an expectation. Of course, many of us believe that data sharing shouldn’t require an international emergency. Requirements by major funding agencies that researchers share data as a condition of their grant award are an interesting recent development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding negative results, they may not win awards, but their publication is unquestionably a contribution to the research community. Think of a forest where a few well-known paths appear on a published map, but most paths are not marked at all, even though some of them have already been explored for long distances only to find they lead nowhere. Surely a signpost should be added to keep others from wasting time and resources. In clinical research, a conclusive negative result can have the immediate benefit of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000152&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preventing futile, costly or hazardous interventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in subsequent patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now PLOS invites all ECRs who meet the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/ecr-travel-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Early Career Researcher Travel Award guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to share their views.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Mutual regulation of tumour vessel normalization and immunostimulatory reprogramming</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21724</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/aHBpNlZqXOM/nature21724</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Blockade of angiogenesis can retard tumour growth, but may also paradoxically increase metastasis. This paradox may be resolved by vessel normalization, which involves increased pericyte coverage, improved tumour vessel perfusion, reduced vascular permeability, and consequently mitigated hypoxia. Although these processes alter tumour progression, their regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that type 1 T helper (TH1) cells play a crucial role in vessel normalization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene expression features related to vessel normalization correlate with immunostimulatory pathways, especially T lymphocyte infiltration or activity. To delineate the causal relationship, we used various mouse models with vessel normalization or T lymphocyte deficiencies. Although disruption of vessel normalization reduced T lymphocyte infiltration as expected, reciprocal depletion or inactivation of CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased vessel normalization, indicating a mutually regulatory loop. In addition, activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by immune checkpoint blockade increased vessel normalization. TH1 cells that secrete interferon-γ are a major population of cells associated with vessel normalization. Patient-derived xenograft tumours growing in immunodeficient mice exhibited enhanced hypoxia compared to the original tumours in immunocompetent humans, and hypoxia was reduced by adoptive TH1 transfer. Our findings elucidate an unexpected role of TH1 cells in vasculature and immune reprogramming. TH1 cells may be a marker and a determinant of both immune checkpoint blockade and anti-angiogenesis efficacy.

	<description>Can neuroscience help courts to decide how criminals should be punished? Is moral responsibility, or the lack of it, visible on a brain scan?

In The Brain Defense (Penguin, 2017, on sale now), author Kevin Davis explores the growing use of brain images as evidence in American courtrooms. What Davis calls the &quot;brain defense&quot; is the strategy of using evidence of apparent brain abnormalities as a mitigating factor when defendants are convicted of violent crimes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really awkward when you’re chatting to someone whose sense of appropriate interpersonal space is way too close. There’s the option of performing a subtle backward shuffle, but what if they simply close the gap again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our judgments about such things obviously vary with individual personality – people with more social anxiety tend to prefer a greater distance – and also on the nature of the relationship we have with the other person. But culture must surely play a part too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out how preferred interpersonal distances vary across the world, the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022117698039&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology&lt;/em&gt; approached – not too close, presumably – nearly 9,000 participants in 42 countries and asked them to indicate on a simple graphic how close another person – either a stranger, friend or more intimate relation – could get to them during a conversation for things to remain comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21711&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three countries where participants’ preferred minimal distance from a stranger was largest were Romania (approximately 140cm), Hungary and Saudi Arabia; conversely the three countries where participants were happiest being most up close with a stranger were Argentina (80cm), Peru and Bulgaria. The UK was represented by England, with participants here coming out near the middle (approximately 1 metre) in terms of the spread of international preferences for when talking with a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The averaged preferred minimal distances from a friend or acquaintance during conversation were smaller, as you’d expect, but the rank order across countries was fairly similar to the order for stranger distance. So, in countries where people tended to prefer a greater distance from strangers during conversation, they also tended to prefer a greater distance from friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, this wasn’t so much the case for preferred minimal distance when conversing with a close or more intimate other person. For instance, Romanians, who you remember liked the largest distance from a stranger, actually came out as having among the smallest preferred minimal distances from an intimate relation (about 50cm). Likewise, Norwegians came out near the middle in the distribution of preferred minimal distances from a stranger, but were happy with the smallest amount of physical distance (approx 40cm) from a close other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Agnieszka Sorokowska and her dozens of colleagues around the world also looked to see if international differences in climate and vulnerability to parasites might correlate with preferred interpersonal differences. The parasite measure wasn’t relevant, but average temperature was: in warmer countries, participants tended to be happier with smaller distances when chatting to strangers, perhaps because &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/10/23/a-warm-room-makes-people-feel-socially-closer/&quot;&gt;people feel socially closer in warmer climes&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers speculated; in contrast, when it came to intimate relationships, it was colder countries that were happier with smaller distances, perhaps as a way to stay cosy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across countries, women tended to prefer greater distances from the other person, as did older participants. An obvious limitation of the study is that it was based on participants’ judgments of the interpersonal distances they think they would prefer, not on actual observations of their behaviour. Still, the researchers collected an impressive amount of data from a huge range of countries, providing a fascinating global perspective on an everyday personal experience: just how close is too close when you’re chatting to another person?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jana Rieger is a researcher in Edmonton, Alberta. And now, she’s also a novelist. Her new book, “A Course in Deception,” draws on her experiences in science, and weaves a tale of how greed and pressures to publish can lead to even worse outcomes than the sort we write about at Retraction Watch. We interviewed Rieger […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Automated validation and comparison of neurophysiological biomarkers of psychiatric disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2017-03-29:/2017/03/29/automated-validation-and-comparison-of-neurophysiological-biomarkers-of-psychiatric-disorders.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2017/03/29/automated-validation-and-comparison-of-neurophysiological-biomarkers-of-psychiatric-disorders.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on psychiatric disorders has gradually shifted its focus from complex clinical phenotypes towards the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypic measures. Computational approaches have gained significantly more attention over the last years, and this has led to the emergence of 'Computational Psychiatry' as an independent discipline. Computational modelling of biomarkers promises to more readily shed light on the mechanisms underlying disorders and to facilitate the discovery of novel medications [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in order to develop a computational model, scientists need to have an in-depth understanding of the current, relevant experimental data, the current state of computational modeling and the state-of-the-art of statistical testing. Based on this knowledge, they have to choose the appropriate criteria with which the model predictions and experimental observations will be compared [2]. In a field where both the number of experimental and computational studies grows rapidly, as is the case for psychiatry, this becomes more and more impracticable. Omar et al. therefore proposed a framework for automated validation of scientific models, SciUnit [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we propose to adopt this framework for the computational psychiatry community and to collaboratively build common repositories of experimental observations, computational models, test suites and tools. As a case in point, we have implemented test suites for auditory steady-state response deficits in schizophrenic patients, which are based on observations from several experimental studies [4,5,6], and we demonstrate how existing computational models [6,7] can be validated against these observations and compared against each other. We have included sets of observations from three experimental studies, which concur on most findings but also disagree on some. This allows us to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in highlighting and clarifying existing, potentially conflicting, experimental data. We have included computational models that not only comprise biophysically detailed as well as abstract models, but that also differ in implementation (native Python vs. Genesis vs NeuroML2), in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach. Furthermore, this additionally allows us to showcase the ability of the framework to compare models against each other based on a set of experimental observations. Furthermore, our approach enables us to assess the variability of the produced model output, and therefore the robustness of the findings, by generating a distribution of model instances where certain parameters, such as the precise timing of noise inputs (however, not the strength and type of noise) or the precise connectivity (however, not the underlying distribution of connections) vary, which then are used to produce a distribution of model outputs. This can inform on the robustness of the findings and can also be compared against the variability of experimental observations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A rising star in nanotechnology, Dmitri Lapotko, has received his second retraction within a month over “a finding of research misconduct” that the university will apparently only disclose on a need-to-know basis. According to the notice, the journal’s editor and publisher issued the retraction after Lapotko’s former institution—Rice University in Houston—notified them of research misconduct and […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the TV series &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;, Saul’s brother Chuck believes that electromagnetic signals from mobile phones and other devices make him seriously ill. He lives as a recluse and uses a foil blanket to protect himself. By some estimates, millions of people – around 5 per cent of the population – believe that they too suffer from “electrosensitivity” or “electromagnetic hypersensitivity”. Though they may not suffer as much as Chuck, these individuals claim that wi-fi and other signals make them ill, triggering headaches and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical consensus based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7546/886.full&quot;&gt;double-blind trials&lt;/a&gt; (in which neither researcher nor test subject knows when a test device is real or pretend) is that while the experience of electrosensitivity-related symptoms may be real, they are not caused by electromagnetic fields. More likely is that the symptoms arise from a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo&quot;&gt;nocebebo effect&lt;/a&gt;” – a strong belief that the fields are harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105317699681&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on electrosensitivity by suggesting that it is people who feel especially connected to nature – normally considered a positive trait – who may be particularly likely to suffer from electrosensitivity, probably because their love of nature is accompanied by a heightened negative attitude to anything they consider artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zsuzsanna Dömötör and her colleagues surveyed 510 people online, 74 of whom described themselves as electrosensitive. The electrosensitive participants tended to score higher than the others on modern health worries in general (related to things like pollution and tainted food), on sensitivity to bodily symptoms, and nature relatedness (measured by agreement with items like “I always think about how my actions affect the environment” and “My ideal vacation spot would be a remote, wilderness area”). What’s more, nature connectedness interacted with the other variables: people prone to modern health worries were especially likely to complain of electrosensitivity if they also felt a connection with nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105317699681&quot;&gt;Nature relatedness is connected with modern health worries and electromagnetic hypersensitivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human mind has been so successful in transforming the material world that it is easy to forget that it too is subject to its own constraints. From biases in our judgment to the imperfection of our memory, psychology has done useful work mapping out many of these limits, yet when it comes to the human imagination, most of us still like to see it as something boundless. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300367&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, on the capacity of our visual imagination, suggests that we soon hit its limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21595&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Keogh and Joel Pearson from the University of New South Wales conducted a series of tightly controlled experiments involving 72 participants, mostly students from the university. In every experiment, participants donned special glasses and sat before a computer screen to view dozens or hundreds of trials each composed of two phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase, the screen was lit up with dotted outlines marking out “imagination spaces”. The participants had to mentally “fill-in” between one and seven of these spaces with a simple pattern, either red with horizontal stripes or green with vertical stripes (similar to those pictured below). Cues in the dotted outlines indicated which pattern to visualize in which space. Participants attempted to keep the imagination spaces appropriately coloured in their minds for six seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterwards, the second phase of each trial determined how successfully the participants had pictured the patterns, and this is where the glasses came into play. They beamed the red pattern into one eye, and the green into the other. When faced with two competing images presented to each eye in this way, the human mind quickly settles on just one image, banishing the other from conscious awareness in a well-known phenomenon called “binocular rivalry”. All things being equal, the battle between competing images is random: half the time one will dominate our perception, half the time the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But crucially, the outcome of this process can be influenced by the content of our imagination, especially when the real and imagined share the same location. The researchers took advantage of this and, each trial, always targeted the real images at one of the imagination spaces that had been triggered in the first phase, to see whether the mental pattern in that location was strong enough to tip the binocular battle one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When participants only had to fill one imagination space, and the two rival real patterns were beamed to this location, the mental image there strongly influenced the rivalry phase: participants were swayed towards seeing whichever real pattern corresponded with the imagined pattern seventy per cent of the time (fifty per cent would mean no influence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once participants were tasked with filling two imagination spaces, the biasing effect of beaming the real patterns onto either one of those imagined patterns dropped to sixty per cent. Imagining three or more patterns led to a further drop-off in the influence of imagined patterns on the process of binocular rivalry. In fact, the experimenters quickly adjusted their design to avoid trials with six or more imagination spaces as it was clear participants couldn’t handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling the imagination phase duration to 12 seconds didn’t improve success for multiple imagination spaces, ruling out the possibility that more imagining just takes more time to get going. Further experiments revealed how the mind deals with greater demands on the imagination: trying to fill more imagination spaces led to rougher mental images at every location, rather than a few filled vividly with others more or less abandoned. This tallies with participants’ descriptions: they said vividness of the imagined patterns suffered as demand increased. This quantity-quality trade-off suggests some kind of resolution issue: think of limited pixels on a screen, or the space available on an artist’s canvas. These two-dimensional examples may be more than an analogy, as visual brain areas have limited anatomical space to represent information, and often do so across two-dimensional maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keogh and Pearson said their results are beginning to map out the “severe capacity limits” of internal representation, and demonstrate how much the architecture of thought depends on the foundations of perception. This is truly important work in understanding the mind, and how much of the world we can truly grasp. Yet, contrasting the effortful yet arbitrary visualisation investigated in this study with the rich, spontaneously arising visions I’ve personally experienced during meditation – or the overwhelming sense of reality we’ve all experienced in dreams – I’m left wondering how these limits may vary according to our states and motivations. That’s worthy of future research, because feeling out the firmament of the imagination is a most worthwhile goal.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: A mother’s love can’t cure it all: No benefits of maternal care on immunity in a group-living insect</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;An earwig family&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Earwig-family-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;During their life, animals encounter many different threats, from predators to parasites, which can weaken or even kill them. To limit the costs of pathogen infections, hosts typically rely on their body’s immune system. But personal immunity is not the only way to be protected from pathogens. In group-living animals, social immunity describes the cooperative actions of group members to fight together against parasites and pathogens. These actions can take many different forms such as reciprocal grooming to remove external parasites, or the sanitary disposal of waste to prevent the growth of pathogenic microbes, as found in ant and bee colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social immunity is also important for species living in family groups (i.e. parents and offspring), in which parents care for their young. Not only humans have been documented to improve the immunity of their children, but also mice and rats. However, it is less clear whether such beneficial effects of parental care exist in insects and whether these benefits could have contributed to the evolution of social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the influence of the mother on offspring immunity, we studied the European earwig &lt;em&gt;Forficula auricularia. &lt;/em&gt;This insect is an interesting model to address this kind of question because earwig mothers provide multiple forms of care to their young such as food provisioning, grooming and protection against predators. Young earwigs are nevertheless mobile, can forage on their own and are thus able to develop and survive in the absence of a tending mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these unique aspects of their lifestyle, we were able to investigate the effect of the mother on offspring immunity by experimentally manipulating maternal presence and parasite exposure. Based on the findings in social vertebrates, we predicted that maternal presence will improve the short- and long-term survival of offspring when exposed to a pathogen. Moreover, we expected that maternal presence either increases offspring immunity, when the resources provided by the mother facilitate the development of the immune system, or alternatively decrease offspring immunity, when young earwigs invest less in immune defenses because of the protection provided by the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8785&quot; style=&quot;width: 2830px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Earwig mother moving her nymphs&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8785&quot; height=&quot;1969&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Earwig_mother-moving-nymphs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2820&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Earwig mother moving her nymphs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Joël Meunier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we found that maternal presence did not affect offspring immunity in the short- or in the long-term, even when exposed to pathogens. Moreover, maternal presence appears to generally reduce offspring survival, independently of pathogen exposure. The fact that maternal presence does not influence pathogen resistance of their young indicates that while unable to ward off disease, care provided by earwig mothers might be useful in other contexts such as protection against predators or adverse climatic conditions. This also suggests that pathogen pressure does not appear to be a universal promoter for the evolution of parental care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprisingly negative effect of maternal presence on offspring survival supports earlier work on earwigs, which reported that the mothers’ influence on the well-being of their offspring also depends on food availability. This highlights the complex nature of mother-offspring interactions, but also indicates that interactions among siblings might be crucial for the evolution of family life, an aspect that deserves more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our findings reveal that the benefits of family interactions in terms of protection against pathogen infection are unlikely to be driven by the mother. Instead, we propose that such benefits could come from the young themselves. In earwigs, mothers and siblings line their nest with their own feces, which exhibits antimicrobial properties. That way, they possibly reduce the need of investing into their personal immunity as their habitat is largely pathogen-free. This investment in social immunity might be an important way to ensure family health. Hence, our findings show that the role of sibling behavior may be an underestimated factor in the evolution and maintenance of family life in the face of pathogen pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Visualization and targeting of LGR5+ human colon cancer stem cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22081</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/V1wshISA7Pw/nature22081</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory highlights a self-renewing subpopulation of cancer cells that fuels tumour growth. The existence of human CSCs is mainly supported by xeno-transplantation of prospectively isolated cells, but their clonal dynamics and plasticity remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that human LGR5+ colorectal cancer cells serve as CSCs in growing cancer tissues. Lineage-tracing experiments with a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated LGR5-CreER knock-in allele reveal self-renewal and differentiation capacity of LGR5+ tumour cells. Selective ablation of LGR5+ CSCs in LGR5-iCaspase9 knock-in organoids leads to tumour regression, followed by tumour regrowth driven by re-emerging LGR5+ CSCs. KRT20-CreER marks differentiated cancer cells that constantly diminish in tumour tissues, while reverting to LGR5+ CSCs and contributing to tumour regrowth after LGR5+ CSC ablation. We also show that combined chemotherapy potentiates LGR5+ CSCs targeting. These data provide insights into the plasticity of CSCs and their potential as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Smart wing rotation and trailing-edge vortices enable high frequency mosquito flight</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high frequencies for their size (&amp;gt;800 Hz)and with lower stroke amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier–Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. The structure of a population can affect which traits evolve. Understanding evolutionary game dynamics in structured populations remains difficult. Mathematical results are known for special structures in which all individuals have the same number of neighbours. The general case, in which the number of neighbours can vary, has remained open. For arbitrary selection intensity, the problem is in a computational complexity class that suggests there is no efficient algorithm. Whether a simple solution for weak selection exists has remained unanswered. Here we provide a solution for weak selection that applies to any graph or network. Our method relies on calculating the coalescence times of random walks. We evaluate large numbers of diverse population structures for their propensity to favour cooperation. We study how small changes in population structure—graph surgery—affect evolutionary outcomes. We find that cooperation flourishes most in societies that are based on strong pairwise ties.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Postsynaptic synaptotagmins mediate AMPA receptor exocytosis during LTP</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Strengthening of synaptic connections by NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) shapes neural circuits and mediates learning and memory. During the induction of NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP, Ca2+ influx stimulates recruitment of synaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors, thereby strengthening synapses. How Ca2+ induces the recruitment of AMPA receptors remains unclear. Here we show that, in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region in mice, blocking postsynaptic expression of both synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), but not of either alone, abolished LTP. LTP was restored by expression of wild-type Syt7 but not of a Ca2+-binding-deficient mutant Syt7. Blocking postsynaptic expression of Syt1 and Syt7 did not impair basal synaptic transmission, reduce levels of synaptic or extrasynaptic AMPA receptors, or alter other AMPA receptor trafficking events. Moreover, expression of dominant-negative mutant Syt1 which inhibits Ca2+-dependent presynaptic vesicle exocytosis, also blocked Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic AMPA receptor exocytosis, thereby abolishing LTP. Our results suggest that postsynaptic Syt1 and Syt7 act as redundant Ca2+-sensors for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of AMPA receptors during LTP, and thereby delineate a simple mechanism for the recruitment of AMPA receptors that mediates LTP.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: CRISPR–Cas systems exploit viral DNA injection to establish and maintain adaptive immunity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas systems provide protection against viral and plasmid infection by capturing short DNA sequences from these invaders and integrating them into the CRISPR locus of the prokaryotic host. These sequences, known as spacers, are transcribed into short CRISPR RNA guides that specify the cleavage site of Cas nucleases in the genome of the invader. It is not known when spacer sequences are acquired during viral infection. Here, to investigate this, we tracked spacer acquisition in Staphylococcus aureus cells harbouring a type II CRISPR–Cas9 system after infection with the staphylococcal bacteriophage ϕ12. We found that new spacers were acquired immediately after infection preferentially from the cos site, the viral free DNA end that is first injected into the cell. Analysis of spacer acquisition after infection with mutant phages demonstrated that most spacers are acquired during DNA injection, but not during other stages of the viral cycle that produce free DNA ends, such as DNA replication or packaging. Finally, we showed that spacers acquired from early-injected genomic regions, which direct Cas9 cleavage of the viral DNA immediately after infection, provide better immunity than spacers acquired from late-injected regions. Our results reveal that CRISPR–Cas systems exploit the phage life cycle to generate a pattern of spacer acquisition that ensures a successful CRISPR immune response.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: DHX9 suppresses RNA processing defects originating from the Alu invasion of the human genome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21715</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transposable elements are viewed as ‘selfish genetic elements’, yet they contribute to gene regulation and genome evolution in diverse ways. More than half of the human genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements belong to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) family of repetitive elements, and with over 1 million insertions they make up more than 10% of the human genome. Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary advantages they confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the host as they can act as splice acceptors, inhibit translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad effect of massive secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements on RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we show that DHX9, an abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements that are transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an increase in the number of circular-RNA-producing genes and amount of circular RNAs, translational repression of reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical novel connections between exons) of susceptible loci. Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify the interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the constitutively expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an RNA-independent interaction partner. Co-depletion of ADAR and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, revealing a functional link between these two enzymes. Our work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved function of DHX9. We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon insertions and allows these elements to evolve as tools for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: A distinct role for Lgr5+ stem cells in primary and metastatic colon cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to represent the driving force behind tumour progression and metastasis, making them attractive cancer targets. However, conclusive experimental evidence for their functional relevance is still lacking for most malignancies. Here we show that the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) identifies intestinal CSCs in mouse tumours engineered to recapitulate the clinical progression of human colorectal cancer. We demonstrate that selective Lgr5+ cell ablation restricts primary tumour growth, but does not result in tumour regression. Instead, tumours are maintained by proliferative Lgr5− cells that continuously attempt to replenish the Lgr5+ CSC pool, leading to rapid re-initiation of tumour growth upon treatment cessation. Notably, CSCs are critical for the formation and maintenance of liver metastasis derived from colorectal cancers. Together, our data highlight distinct CSC dependencies for primary versus metastasic tumour growth, and suggest that targeting CSCs may represent a therapeutic opportunity for managing metastatic disease.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Single-nucleus Hi-C reveals unique chromatin reorganization at oocyte-to-zygote transition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21711</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Chromatin is reprogrammed after fertilization to produce a totipotent zygote with the potential to generate a new organism. The maternal genome inherited from the oocyte and the paternal genome provided by sperm coexist as separate haploid nuclei in the zygote. How these two epigenetically distinct genomes are spatially organized is poorly understood. Existing chromosome conformation capture-based methods are not applicable to oocytes and zygotes owing to a paucity of material. To study three-dimensional chromatin organization in rare cell types, we developed a single-nucleus Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) protocol that provides greater than tenfold more contacts per cell than the previous method. Here we show that chromatin architecture is uniquely reorganized during the oocyte-to-zygote transition in mice and is distinct in paternal and maternal nuclei within single-cell zygotes. Features of genomic organization including compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops are present in individual oocytes when averaged over the genome, but the presence of each feature at a locus varies between cells. At the sub-megabase level, we observed stochastic clusters of contacts that can occur across TAD boundaries but average into TADs. Notably, we found that TADs and loops, but not compartments, are present in zygotic maternal chromatin, suggesting that these are generated by different mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the global chromatin organization of zygote nuclei is fundamentally different from that of other interphase cells. An understanding of this zygotic chromatin ‘ground state’ could potentially provide insights into reprogramming cells to a state of totipotency.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Myeloid progenitor cluster formation drives emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Although many aspects of blood production are well understood, the spatial organization of myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow remains unknown. Here we use imaging to track granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) behaviour in mice during emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis. In the steady state, we find individual GMPs scattered throughout the bone marrow. During regeneration, we observe expanding GMP patches forming defined GMP clusters, which, in turn, locally differentiate into granulocytes. The timed release of important bone marrow niche signals (SCF, IL-1β, G-CSF, TGFβ and CXCL4) and activation of an inducible Irf8 and β-catenin progenitor self-renewal network control the transient formation of regenerating GMP clusters. In leukaemia, we show that GMP clusters are constantly produced owing to persistent activation of the self-renewal network and a lack of termination cytokines that normally restore haematopoietic stem-cell quiescence. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized dynamic behaviour of GMPs in situ, which tunes emergency myelopoiesis and is hijacked in leukaemia.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Mapping of a non-spatial dimension by the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location, head direction, speed, and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal–entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a reader contacted us with an interesting scenario: He’d recently heard about an author who asked for a refund of his page charges after he had to retract a paper for an honest error. The scenario raised questions we’d never considered before. On the one hand, page charges often cover work that was completed in […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In an unusual turn of events, a nutrition paper has come back to life a year after being pulled from its original publication. After the paper was retracted from the journal Obesity, the authors revised it and republished it in another journal, Pediatric Obesity. Both journals are published by Wiley. The second version of the paper […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the courts wanted to know if a suspected sex offender was attracted to children, they could ask him or her, or they could ask experts to measure signs of the suspect’s sexual arousal while he or she looked at different images. But a devious suspect would surely lie about their interests, and they could distract themselves to cheat the physical test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain scans offer an alternative strategy: research shows that when we look at images that we find sexually attractive, our brains show distinct patterns of activation. But of course, the same issues of cheating and deliberate distraction could apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless, that is, you could somehow prevent the suspect from knowing what images they were looking at, by using subliminal stimuli that can’t be seen at a conscious level. Then you could see how their brain responds to different types of image without the suspect even knowing what they were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of a strategy tested in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810016302446?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;. Martina Wernicke at Asklepios Forensic Psychiatric Hospital of Gottingen and her colleagues have provided a partial proof of principle that it might one day be possible to use subliminally presented images in a brain scanner to provide a fraud-proof test of a person’s sexual interests. It’s a potentially important break-through for crime prevention – given that deviant sexual interest is one of the strongest predictors of future offences – but it also raises important ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21433&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wernicke and her team scanned the brains of 24 healthy, heterosexual men with fMRI while they looked at images of naked men and women, or more explicitly pornographic images that depicted either naked men or women masturbating. The idea was that, given their sexual orientation, the participating men’s brains would show a distinct pattern of activity when looking at the naked women compared with when looking at naked men, especially in the more explicit context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another detail is that the researchers attempted to make some of the images subliminal – that is, not visible at a conscious level. To do this, they presented the target images twice extremely briefly – just 16.7 milliseconds at a time – and they used one of two types of “mask”. A mask in this context is a second, distracting image shown immediately after the first instance of the target image and designed to interfere with the processing of that target image. After the scanning session, a memory test was used to find out how much the participants had processed the subliminal images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with past research, the men’s brains showed a distinct pattern of activity across a range of areas when they viewed consciously visible images of naked women compared with naked men. But what about when images were made subliminal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the challenge was to make the images inaccessible to conscious awareness, but still visible enough for the brain to process them. One type of mask the researchers used was different neutral scenes, such as a leaf or a rustic street scene. In a sense, these masks interfered too much with the processing of the naked pictures. Not only were the participants unable to identity which of the naked images they’d seen before, but also there was no difference in their brain activity whether they were looking at images of naked men or naked women, sexually explicit or otherwise. In this condition, the participants were also unable to identify afterwards, from a mix of new and previously seen images, which ones they’d seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also tested a second type of mask – scrambled versions of the naked images – and these were more successful. The participants said they couldn’t see the naked images rendered subliminal in this way, yet their brains showed distinct patterns of activity in response to the images of naked women compared with naked men. In other words, the brain scans seemed to betray their sexual preference, even though they didn’t know what images they’d been looking at – the foundations of a fraud-proof test. In a memory quiz afterwards, the participants showed some very limited ability to distinguish previously seen naked images from new ones, but the researchers think this could have been based on memory traces stored earlier at a non-conscious level, though this is open to debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work will be needed to find the precise sweet spot where images are not visible at a conscious level, but are still processed enough by the brain to betray neural signs of sexual preference. This study was a proof of principle with heterosexual men and further research would also need to examine the sensitive issue of what kinds of images could be used to investigate suspected sexual interest in children – for instance would benign images provoke the necessary neural effects to make this a feasible forensic test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, while it’s easy to see how this approach could help in the detection of deviant sexual interest, it’s a strategy that raises serious ethical issues. It’s well known that the link between physical sexual arousal and subjective sexual interest is often far from straight-forward. It seems highly likely that the link between neural markers of sexual interest and subjective sexual preference will be even more complex. As a society, are we ready to accept the idea of psychologists measuring our sexual preferences by scanning our brain activity?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Back in 2015, I ran a three part post (1,2,3) on Dr Kenneth Blum and his claim to be able to treat what he calls &quot;Reward Deficiency Syndrome&quot; (RDS) with nutritional supplements.

Today my interest was drawn to a 2015 paper from Blum and colleagues, called Neuroquantum Theories of Psychiatric Genetics: Can Physical Forces Induce Epigenetic Influence on Future Genomes?.



In this paper, Blum et al. put forward some novel proposals about possible links between physics, epigenetics, and neuro</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;SCOPUS, the publication database maintained by Elsevier, has discontinued nearly 300 journals since 2013, including multiple journals published by OMICS Publishing Group. Although the reasons the widely used database gives for discontinuing journals often vary, in all cases OMICS journals were removed over “Publication Concerns.” Here’s what SCOPUS said recently about how it vets journals: …several […]&lt;/p&gt;

That’s according to a study of over 6000 young people in England published recently in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e012989&quot;&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by researchers at UCL. While the results may sound surprising, they shouldn’t be. The finding is in fact consistent with earlier research that showed a relationship between higher childhood IQ and the use in adolescence of a wide range of illegal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-21401&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Williams and Gareth Hagger-Johnson categorised their participants as high or low academic achievers based on their record at age 11 in English, Maths and Science. Once in their teens, the high ability participants were more than twice as likely to regularly drink alcohol, but less likely to smoke cigarettes or engage in hazardous consumption of alcohol, defined as reporting being drunk more than 52 times per year. The higher ability students also smoked cannabis more during late adolescence, both regular and occasional use; the likelihood that their use would continue persistently was nearly double that of their lower ability peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new results jibe with evidence from the 1970 British Cohort Study which has followed over 16,000 babies born in April 1970 from birth to the present day. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/66/9/767&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2011 of eligible members of this cohort found that high IQ scores at ten years of age were linked to cannabis use at 16 years of age as well as cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine and ecstasy use at 30 years of age. This pattern held after taking account of parents’ social class, income and education and children’s levels of psychological distress during adolescence and their later adult socioeconomic advantage, though it’s difficult to rule out the role these factors may have played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies only show correlations and they don’t tell us why the patterns exist. One possible explanation is that intelligent children have an increased desire for novelty and stimulation. Intelligence has long been known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Heggestad/publication/14115879_Intelligence_Personality_and_Interests_Evidence_for_Overlapping_Traits/links/53dba8460cf2cfac9928f604.pdf&quot;&gt;correlate&lt;/a&gt; with openness to new experiences, it could well be that the same forces that motivate intelligent people to learn about their environment also motivate them to use drugs. But the fact that the academic ability/ drug-taking relationship in the new &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt; study was strongest for persistent use of alcohol and cannabis would suggest that this is not simply down to intelligent children having a tendency towards a short period of “experimentation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative explanation put forward by the researchers behind the 2011 cohort study is that intelligent children &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.969.5553&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;often feel&lt;/a&gt; stigmatised by their peers. Perhaps higher levels of drug and alcohol use could be a coping strategy to being bullied or ostracised. Conversely, perhaps intelligent children are in fact more socially adept and therefore more likely to be accepted by older children, resulting in increased access to drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another explanation is that intelligent and well-educated children and adults may be more likely to recognise that the risks of consuming drugs and alcohol are often widely overstated. Several studies have found very &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msrj.chm.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MSRJ-Winter-2014-Substance-Use-Among-Physicians-and-Medical-Students.pdf&quot;&gt;high levels of drug use among doctors and medical students&lt;/a&gt;, who should have a far better understanding of the true risks of using drugs than the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that children see through more simplistic attempts to dissuade them from consuming drugs and alcohol and it is perhaps fair to assume that this effect would be stronger for more intelligent and better educated children. Several studies of alcohol and drug education programs in the United States have found these schemes to have no effect. One carefully controlled longitudinal study even found a harmful effect of the &lt;em&gt;Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) &lt;/em&gt;programme, famed for popularising the “Just Say No” mantra – children in suburban schools who received the programme subsequently showed &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427898035004002&quot;&gt;increased levels&lt;/a&gt; of drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research adds further weight to the argument that drug education programmes would likely be more beneficial if they were more educational and evidence-based. This could include an emphasis on the increased risks to developing brains from consuming drugs and alcohol at an early age, and advice focused on harm-reduction so that young people who do choose to use drugs are better equipped to do so safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better metric for the success of drug education strategies may be the rate of harm caused as a result of drug and alcohol use. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37315941&quot;&gt;While drug use in the UK has fallen over recent years, numbers of drug deaths have risen, heavily driven by opiate deaths&lt;/a&gt;. The combined evidence suggests a need to take a step back and assess the effectiveness, long term impacts and possible unintended side effects of existing strategies to guide children’s choices.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: In-crystal reaction cycle of a toluene-bound diiron hydroxylase</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Electrophilic aromatic substitution is one of the most important and recognizable classes of organic chemical transformation. Enzymes create the strong electrophiles that are needed for these highly energetic reactions by using O2, electrons, and metals or other cofactors. Although the nature of the oxidants that carry out electrophilic aromatic substitution has been deduced from many approaches, it has been difficult to determine their structures. Here we show the structure of a diiron hydroxylase intermediate formed during a reaction with toluene. Density functional theory geometry optimizations of an active site model reveal that the intermediate is an arylperoxo Fe2+/Fe3+ species with delocalized aryl radical character. The structure suggests that a carboxylate ligand of the diiron centre may trigger homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond by transferring a proton from a metal-bound water. Our work provides the spatial and electronic constraints needed to propose a comprehensive mechanism for diiron enzyme arene hydroxylation that accounts for many prior experimental results.

	<description>Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part IV&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, dear reader, we meet again for the fourth and final instalment of our series of posts on using Dogen with ODB! And if you missed an episode - unlikely as it may be - well, fear not for you can always catch up! Here are the links: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with_24.html&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt;. But, if you are too lazy and need a summary: all we've done thus far is to install and setup an Oracle Express database, populate it with a schema (and data) and finally code-generate an ORM model with Dogen and ODB. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess it would not be entirely unfair to describe our adventure thus far as a prelude; if nothing else, it was a character building experience. But &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; we can finally enjoy the code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Building Zango&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have checked out &lt;code&gt;zango&lt;/code&gt; as described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html&quot;&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt; and you are sitting on its containing directory, you can &quot;configure&quot; the project fairly simply: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ . /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh&lt;br /&gt;$ cd zango&lt;br /&gt;$ git pull origin master&lt;br /&gt;$ cd build&lt;br /&gt;$ mkdir output&lt;br /&gt;$ cd output&lt;br /&gt;$ CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/full/path/to/local/include CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/local/lib cmake ../.. -G Ninja&lt;br /&gt;-- The C compiler identification is GNU 6.3.0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;lots of CMake output&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Generating done&lt;br /&gt;-- Build files have been written to: /path/to/zango/build/output&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;As always, do not forget to replace &lt;code&gt;/full/path/to/local&lt;/code&gt; with your path to the directory containing the ODB libraries. If all has gone according to plan, CMake should have found ODB, Boost, Dogen and all other dependencies we have carefully and painstakingly setup in the previous three parts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the configuration is done, you can fire up Ninja to build: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ninja -j5&lt;br /&gt;[1/100] Building CXX object projects/northwind/src/CMakeFiles/northwind.dir/io/category_id_io.cpp.o&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;lots of Ninja output&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;[98/100] Linking CXX static library projects/northwind/src/libzango.northwind.a&lt;br /&gt;[99/100] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/application.dir/projects/application/main.cpp.o&lt;br /&gt;[100/100] Linking CXX executable application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was easy! But what exactly have we just built? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;The &quot;Application&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've created a really simple application to test drive the northwind model. Of course, this is really &lt;i&gt;not how your production code should look like&lt;/i&gt;, but it'll do just fine for our purposes. We shall start by reading a password from the command line and then we use it to instantiate our Oracle database: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;    const std::string password(argv[1]);&lt;br /&gt;    using odb::oracle::database;&lt;br /&gt;    std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;database&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        db(new database(&quot;northwind&quot;, password, &quot;XE&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;, 1521));&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We then use this database to read all available customers: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;std::list&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;load_customers(odb::oracle::database&amp;amp; db) {&lt;br /&gt;    odb::oracle::transaction t(db.begin());&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    std::list&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt; r;&lt;br /&gt;    auto rs(db.query&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt;());&lt;br /&gt;    for (auto i(rs.begin ()); i != rs.end (); ++i)&lt;br /&gt;        r.push_back(*i);&lt;br /&gt;    return r;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please note that this is a straightforward use of the ODB API, but barely scratches the surface of what ODB can do. ODB supports all sorts of weird and wonderful things, including fairly complex queries and other great features. If you'd like more details on how to use ODB, you should read its manual: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/doc/manual.xhtml&quot;&gt;C++ Object Persistence with ODB&lt;/a&gt;. It's extremely comprehensive and very well written. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once we have the customers in memory, we can start to do things with them. We can for example serialise them to a Boost serialisation binary archive and read them back out: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;    boost::filesystem::path file(&quot;a_file.bin&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        boost::filesystem::ofstream os(file);&lt;br /&gt;        boost::archive::binary_oarchive oa(os);&lt;br /&gt;        oa &amp;lt;&amp;lt; customers;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Wrote customers to file: &quot;&lt;br /&gt;              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; file.generic_string() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    std::list&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt; customers_from_file;&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        boost::filesystem::ifstream is(file);&lt;br /&gt;        boost::archive::binary_iarchive ia(is);&lt;br /&gt;        ia &amp;gt;&amp;gt; customers_from_file;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where hopefully you should start to see the advantages of Dogen: without writing any code, we have full serialisation support to all classes in the model - in addition to ODB support, of course. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another very useful feature is to dump objects into a stream: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;    for (const auto&amp;amp; c : customers_from_file)&lt;br /&gt;        std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Customer: &quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; c &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The objects are written in JSON, making it easy to post-process the output with JSON tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stedolan/jq&quot;&gt;JQ&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a nicely formatted string: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;__type__&quot;: &quot;zango::northwind::customers&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;customer_id&quot;: {&lt;br /&gt;    &quot;__type__&quot;: &quot;zango::northwind::customer_id&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;    &quot;value&quot;: 90&lt;br /&gt;  },&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;customer_code&quot;: &quot;WILMK&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;company_name&quot;: &quot;Wilman Kala&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;contact_name&quot;: &quot;Matti Karttunen&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;contact_title&quot;: &quot;Owner/Marketing Assistant&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;Keskuskatu 45&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Helsinki&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;postal_code&quot;: &quot;21240&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;country&quot;: &quot;Finland&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;90-224 8858&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;fax&quot;: &quot;90-224 8858&quot;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogen supports dumping arbitrarily-nested graphs, so it's great for logging program state as you go along. We make extensive use of this in Dogen, since - &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; - we use Dogen to develop Dogen. Whilst this has proven invaluable, we have also hit some limits. For example, sometimes you may bump into really large and complex objects and JQ just won't cut it. But the great thing is that you can always dump the JSON into PostgreSQL - very easily indeed, given the ODB support - and then run queries on the object using the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://schinckel.net/2014/05/25/querying-json-in-postgres/&quot;&gt;JSONB&lt;/a&gt;. With a tiny bit more bother you can also dump the objects into MongoDB. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, with all of this said, it is also important to notice that we &lt;b&gt;do not support proper JSON serialisation&lt;/b&gt; in Dogen at the moment. This will be added Real-Soon-Now, as we have a real need for it in production, but its not there yet. At present all you have is this debug-dumping of objects into streams which &lt;i&gt;happens&lt;/i&gt; to be JSON. It is not real JSON serialisation. Real JSON support is very high on our priority list though, so expect it to land in the next few sprints. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another useful Dogen feature is test data generation. This can be handy for performance testing, for example. Let's say we want to generate ~10K customers and see how Oracle fares: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt; generate_customers() {&lt;br /&gt;    std::vector&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt; r;&lt;br /&gt;    const auto total(10 * 1000);&lt;br /&gt;    r.reserve(total);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    zango::northwind::customers_generator g;&lt;br /&gt;    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; total; ++i) {&lt;br /&gt;        const auto c(g());&lt;br /&gt;        if (i &amp;gt; 100)&lt;br /&gt;            r.push_back(g());&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    return r;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that we skipped the first hundred customers just to avoid clashes with the &lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt; primary key. Now, thanks to the magic of ODB we can easily push this data into the database: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;void save_customers(odb::oracle::database&amp;amp; db,&lt;br /&gt;    const std::vector&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt;&amp;amp; customers) {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    odb::transaction t(db.begin());&lt;br /&gt;    for (const auto c : customers)&lt;br /&gt;        db.persist(c);&lt;br /&gt;    t.commit();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Et voilá&lt;/i&gt;, we have lots of customers in the database now: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;SQL&amp;gt; select count(1) from customers;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  COUNT(1)&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;      9990&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be totally honest, this exercise revealed a shortcoming in Dogen: since it does not know of the size of fields on the database, the generated test data may in some cases be too big to fit the database fields: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving customers...&lt;br /&gt;terminate called after throwing an instance of 'odb::oracle::database_exception'&lt;br /&gt;  what():  12899: ORA-12899: value too large for column &quot;NORTHWIND&quot;.&quot;CUSTOMERS&quot;.&quot;CUSTOMER_CODE&quot; (actual: 6, maximum: 5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;I solved this problem with a quick hack for this article (by removing the prefix used in the test data) but a proper fix is now sitting in Dogen's product backlog for implementation in the near future. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, just for giggles, I decided to push the data we read from Oracle into &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;, an in-memory cache that seems to be all the rage amongst the Cool-Kid community. To keep things simple, I used the C API provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/redis/hiredis&quot;&gt;hiredis&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, if this was the real world, I would have used one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/clients#c--&quot;&gt;many c++ clients&lt;/a&gt; for Redis such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mrpi/redis-cplusplus-client&quot;&gt;redis-cplusplus-client&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cylix/cpp_redis&quot;&gt;cpp redis&lt;/a&gt;. As it was, I could not find any Debian packages for them, so I'll just have to pretend I know C. Since I'm not much of a C programmer, I decided to do a very bad copy and paste job from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26799074/can-we-set-c-int-array-as-a-keys-value-in-redis-by-hiredis&quot;&gt;this Stack Overflow article&lt;/a&gt;. The result was this beauty (forgive me in advance, C programmers): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    redisContext *c;&lt;br /&gt;    redisReply *reply;&lt;br /&gt;    const char *hostname = &quot;localhost&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;    int port = 6379;&lt;br /&gt;    struct timeval timeout = { 1, 500000 }; // 1.5 seconds&lt;br /&gt;    c = redisConnectWithTimeout(hostname, port, timeout);&lt;br /&gt;    if (c == NULL || c-&amp;gt;err) {&lt;br /&gt;        if (c) {&lt;br /&gt;            std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Connection error: &quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; c-&amp;gt;errstr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;            redisFree(c);&lt;br /&gt;        } else {&lt;br /&gt;            std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Connection error: can't allocate redis context&quot;&lt;br /&gt;                      &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        return 1;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    std::ostringstream os;&lt;br /&gt;    boost::archive::binary_oarchive oa(os);&lt;br /&gt;    oa &amp;lt;&amp;lt; customers;&lt;br /&gt;    const auto value(os.str());&lt;br /&gt;    const std::string key(&quot;customers&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;    reply = (redisReply*)redisCommand(c, &quot;SET %b %b&quot;, key.c_str(),&lt;br /&gt;        (size_t) key.size(), value.c_str(), (size_t) value.size());&lt;br /&gt;    if (!reply)&lt;br /&gt;        return REDIS_ERR;&lt;br /&gt;    freeReplyObject(reply);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    reply = (redisReply*)redisCommand(c, &quot;GET %b&quot;, key.c_str(),&lt;br /&gt;        (size_t) key.size());&lt;br /&gt;    if (!reply)&lt;br /&gt;        return REDIS_ERR;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    if ( reply-&amp;gt;type != REDIS_REPLY_STRING ) {&lt;br /&gt;        std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;ERROR: &quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; reply-&amp;gt;str &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;        return 1;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    const std::string redis_value(reply-&amp;gt;str, reply-&amp;gt;len);&lt;br /&gt;    std::istringstream is(redis_value);&lt;br /&gt;    std::list&amp;lt;zango::northwind::customers&amp;gt; customers_from_redis;&lt;br /&gt;    boost::archive::binary_iarchive ia(is);&lt;br /&gt;    ia &amp;gt;&amp;gt; customers_from_redis;&lt;br /&gt;    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Read from redis: &quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; customers_from_redis.size()&lt;br /&gt;              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Front customer (redis): &quot;&lt;br /&gt;              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; customers_from_redis.front() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br /&gt;    freeReplyObject(reply);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it &lt;i&gt;actually works&lt;/i&gt;. Here's the output, with manual formatting of JSON: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read from redis: 91&lt;br /&gt;Front customer (redis):  {&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;__type__&quot;: &quot;zango::northwind::customers&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;customer_id&quot;: {&lt;br /&gt;    &quot;__type__&quot;: &quot;zango::northwind::customer_id&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;    &quot;value&quot;: 1&lt;br /&gt;  },&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;customer_code&quot;: &quot;ALFKI&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;company_name&quot;: &quot;Alfreds Futterkiste&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;contact_name&quot;: &quot;Maria Anders&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;contact_title&quot;: &quot;Sales Representative&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;Obere Str. 57&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Berlin&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;postal_code&quot;: &quot;12209&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;country&quot;: &quot;Germany&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;030-0074321&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;fax&quot;: &quot;030-0076545&quot;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can hopefully see, in very few lines of code we managed to connect to a RDBMS, read some data, push it into a stream, read it and write into Boost Serialization archives and push it into and out of Redis. All this in fairly efficient C++ code (and some very dodgy C code, but we'll keep that one quiet). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A final note on the CMake targets. Zango comes with a couple of targets for Dogen and ODB: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;knit_northwind&lt;/code&gt; generates the Dogen code from the model. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;odb_northwind&lt;/code&gt; runs ODB against the Dogen model, generating the ODB sources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ODB target is added automatically by Dogen. The Dogen target was added manually by yours truly, and it is considered good practice to have one such target when you use Dogen so that other Dogen users know how to generate your models. You can, of course, name it what you like, but in the interest of making everyone's life easier its best if you follow the convention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Oracle and Bulk Fetching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was playing around with ODB and Oracle, I noticed a slight problem: there is no bulk fetch support in the ODB Oracle wrappers at present; it works for other scenarios, but not for selects. I reported this to the main ODB mailing list &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/pipermail/odb-users/2017-February/003641.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. By the by, the ODB community is very friendly and their mailing list is a very responsive place to chat about ODB issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, so you can have an idea of this problem, here's a fetch of our generated customers without prefetch support: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generating customers...&lt;br /&gt;Generated customers. Size: 9899&lt;br /&gt;Saving customers...&lt;br /&gt;Saved customers.&lt;br /&gt;Read generated customers. Size: 9990 time (ms): 263.449&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;code&gt;263.449&lt;/code&gt; for a moment. Now say you delete all rows we generated: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;delete from  customers where customer_id &amp;gt; 100;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, say you apply to &lt;code&gt;libodb-oracle&lt;/code&gt; the hastily-hacked patch I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/pipermail/odb-users/2017-February/003648.html&quot;&gt;in that mailing list thread&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I am hand-waving here greatly, as you need to rebuild the library, install the binaries, rebuild zango, etc, but you get the gist. At any rate, here's the patch, hard-coding an unscientifically-obtained-prefetch of 5K rows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- original_statement.txt 2017-02-09 15:45:56.585765500 +0000&lt;br /&gt;+++ statement.cxx        2017-02-13 10:18:28.447916100 +0000&lt;br /&gt;@@ -1574,18 +1574,29 @@&lt;br /&gt;       OCIError* err (conn_.error_handle ());&lt;br /&gt;+      const int prefetchSize(5000);&lt;br /&gt;+      sword r = OCIAttrSet (stmt_,&lt;br /&gt;+          OCI_HTYPE_STMT,&lt;br /&gt;+          (void*)&amp;amp;prefetchSize,&lt;br /&gt;+          sizeof(int),&lt;br /&gt;+          OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS,&lt;br /&gt;+          err);&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;+      if (r == OCI_ERROR || r == OCI_INVALID_HANDLE)&lt;br /&gt;+          translate_error (err, r);&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;       // @@ Retrieve a single row into the already bound output buffers as an&lt;br /&gt;       // optimization?

Size: 9899&lt;br /&gt;Saving customers...&lt;br /&gt;Saved customers.&lt;br /&gt;Read generated customers. Size: 9990 time (ms): 40.85&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magic! We're down to &lt;code&gt;40.85&lt;/code&gt;. Now that I have a proper setup, I am going to start working on upstreaming this patch, so that ODB can expose the fetch configuration for fetching in a similar manner it already does for other purposes. If you are interested in the gory technical details, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/pipermail/odb-users/2017-February/003651.html&quot;&gt;Boris' reply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this concluding part gave you an idea of why you might want to use Dogen with ODB for your modeling needs. Sadly, its not easy to frame the discussion adequately, so that you have all the required context in order to place these two tools in the continuum of tooling; but I'm hoping this series of articles was useful to at least help you setup Oracle Express in Debian and get an idea of what you can do with these two tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2017-03-25 Sat 20:26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.1.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part I&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen&quot;&gt;Dogen&lt;/a&gt; paying customer, I finally got a chance to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/&quot;&gt;ODB&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codesynthesis.com&quot;&gt;Code Synthesis'&lt;/a&gt; amazingly interesting C++ Object-Relational Mapping tool, built on the back of the GCC plugin system. I've personally always been in awe of what Boris Kolpackov has achieved, and, of course, it being a South African company made me all the more keen to use their wares. More importantly: the product just seems to rock in terms of polish, features and documentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Astute readers of this blog will point out that Dogen has been supporting ODB for quite some time. That is indeed true, but since I haven't used this feature in anger, I wasn't sure how good the support really was; our fairly trivial database model (&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/fe6a0c7b48b49554d3211e1a2c2b07fb0f09d502/projects/input_models/database.dia&quot;&gt;Dia&lt;/a&gt;) explored only a small fraction of what is possible. Now that I finally had a chance to use it in production, I needed to expand the tests and try to replicate the customer's scenario as close as possible. As always in these situations, there was a snag: instead of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; - the RDBMS I had originally used in my Dogen tests - they were using Oracle. So my first task was to setup Oracle locally on my beloved Debian Linux. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Never one to miss an opportunity, I decided this adventure was worthy of a quick blog post; it soon turned out to be a series of posts, if I was to do any justice to this strange and wild experiment, through all of its twists and turns. But hopefully it is worth the effort, as it also demonstrates what you can do with Dogen and ODB. And so, here we are. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first part of the series deals with just trying to convince Oracle to run on Debian Testing - something that &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; Oracle does not support out of the box. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, a word to the wise: this is a &lt;b&gt;highly experimental&lt;/b&gt;Oracle setup, which I embarked upon just because I could; follow it at your own peril, and &lt;b&gt;do not use it anywhere near production&lt;/b&gt;. More generally, if you want to stick to the beaten track, use Oracle on RHEL, CentOS or - god forbid - even Windows. All of that said, if like me, you are a Debian person, well, there's not much for it other than to fire off a VM and start looking for those damned faint tracks in the jungle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Alien Worlds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first stumbling block was Oracle itself. After all, for all the many years of using this RBDMS at work - more than I care to admit in polite company - I suddenly realised I actually never used it at home. Or course, Oracle has supported Linux for a little while now; and the good news is they have a &quot;free&quot; version available: Oracle Database Express Edition (XE). A quick glance at the Oracle website revealed RPM's for 64-bits (Intel only, of course). So before anything else, I decided to brush up my knowledge of Alien. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alien is a debian package that converts RPMs into DEBs. I've used it in the past for another (lovely) Oracle technology: Java. It had worked wonderfully well then so I thought I'd give it a try. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RPM/AlienHowto&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Alien HowTo&lt;/a&gt; is pretty straightforward, and so is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/Alien&quot;&gt;Debian's&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, obtain Alien: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sudo apt-get install alien&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then apply it to the RPM in question. So the next quest was obtaining those darn RPMs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, once you move away from the easy world of Free and Open Source Software, things start to get a bit more complicated. Those lovely links you can easy Google for don't actually work until you sign up for an Oracle developer account, asking &lt;i&gt;all sorts&lt;/i&gt; of personal information. Sadly, even listening to Tesla earnings conferences requires registering these days. Undaunted, I filled all required fields, obtained my developer account and returned to download my loot. For Oracle Express it's rather straightforward: there is a grand-total of one package for Linux 64-bit, so you can't really go wrong. Here's the link, just in case: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Express&lt;/a&gt;: download the 64-bit Linux RPM &lt;code&gt;oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that they decided to zip the RPM but you can easily unzip it with the &lt;code&gt;unzip&lt;/code&gt; tool. The contents are the RPM Alien expects, plus a few oracle specific files which I decided to ignore for now: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ unzip oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;br /&gt;Archive:  oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/upgrade/&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/upgrade/gen_inst.sql&lt;br /&gt;   creating: Disk1/response/&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/response/xe.rsp&lt;br /&gt;  inflating: Disk1/oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a quick glance at the instructions, it appeared the Oracle Express package contained just the database server - that meant it did not include a command line client, or the APIs to build applications that talk to the database. To be fair, this is not an entirely uncommon approach; Debian also packages the PostgreSQL server separately from the development libraries. But behind &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;synaptic&lt;/code&gt;, installation of packages is all so trivial. Not so when you have to go through lots of detailed explanations of different packages and variations. But; onwards! In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html&quot;&gt;Instant client&lt;/a&gt; page, I settled on the downloading the following: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basic&lt;/i&gt;: client shared libraries. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;SQL Plus&lt;/i&gt;: command-line client. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;SDK&lt;/i&gt;: header files to compile code. Package: &lt;code&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: As it turns out, I was wrong on my original expectations, and you don't really need the SQL Plus package - its already included with Oracle Express. But I only figured it out much later, so I'll leave the steps as I originally followed them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all of these packages in hand, I swiftly got busy with Alien, only to also rather swiftly hit an issue: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cd Disk1&lt;br /&gt;$ alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;Must run as root to convert to deb format (or you may use fakeroot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, sadly you cannot run alien directly as an unprivileged user. I did not wish to start reading up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/FakeRoot&quot;&gt;FakeRoot&lt;/a&gt; - seems straightforward enough, to be fair, but hey - so I took the easy way out and ran all the Alien commands as root. Note also the &lt;code&gt;--scripts&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the scripts will also get converted across. This will bring us some other… interesting issues, shall we say, but seems worthwhile doing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quite a few seconds later (hey, it was a 300 MB RPM!), a nice looking DEB was generated: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rather promising start. For good measure, I repeated the process with all RPMs, all with similar results: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# alien  oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;br /&gt;oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voila, all DEBs generated. Of course, as the English love to say, the proof is in the pudding - whatever that means, exactly. So before one can celebrate, you should try to install the generated packages. That can be easily done with our old trusty &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-xe.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 564824 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Executing post-install steps...&lt;br /&gt;/var/lib/dpkg/info/oracle-xe.postinst: line 114: /sbin/chkconfig: No such file or directory&lt;br /&gt;You must run '/etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure' as the root user to configure the database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for systemd (232-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.23-1) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it seems the error for chkconfig is related to setting up the service to  autostart. Since this was not a key requirement for my purposes, I decided to ignore it. The remaining RPMs - or should I say DEBs - installed beautifully: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-basic.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 564801 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 567895 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb&lt;br /&gt;Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-devel.&lt;br /&gt;(Reading database ... 567903 files and directories currently installed.)&lt;br /&gt;Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Talking to the Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, at this point in time we have a bunch of stuff installed in all sorts of random (read: Oracle-like) locations. The database itself is under &lt;code&gt;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/&lt;/code&gt;, and all the other packages seemed to have gone into &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64/&lt;/code&gt;. The first task is now to start the database server. For this we can rely on the scripts we installed earlier on. However, before we proceed, one little spoiler: we need to ensure the scripts can find &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;/bin/awk&lt;/code&gt; (these days it lives in &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/awk&lt;/code&gt;). For this we can do a swift (and brutal) hack: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# ln -s /usr/bin/awk /bin/awk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we can configure it. I accepted all of the defaults, and setup a suitably sensible password: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# cd /etc/init.d/&lt;br /&gt;# /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oracle Database 11g Express Edition Configuration&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This will configure on-boot properties of Oracle Database 11g Express&lt;br /&gt;Edition.  The following questions will determine whether the database should&lt;br /&gt;be starting upon system boot, the ports it will use, and the passwords that&lt;br /&gt;will be used for database accounts.  Press &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; to accept the defaults.&lt;br /&gt;Ctrl-C will abort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify the HTTP port that will be used for Oracle Application Express [8080]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify a port that will be used for the database listener [1521]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specify a password to be used for database accounts.  Note that the same&lt;br /&gt;password will be used for SYS and SYSTEM.  Oracle recommends the use of&lt;br /&gt;different passwords for each database account.  This can be done after&lt;br /&gt;initial configuration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confirm the password:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want Oracle Database 11g Express Edition to be started on boot (y/n) [y]:y&lt;br /&gt;y&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting Oracle Net Listener...Done&lt;br /&gt;Configuring database...&lt;br /&gt;Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance...Done&lt;br /&gt;Installation completed successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice how your port 8080 has been hogged. If you are using it for other work, you may need to move the Oracle Application Express server to some other port. At any rate, after this I could indeed see a whole load of Oracle processes running: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ps -ef | grep oracle&lt;br /&gt;oracle   20228     1  0 22:35 ?        00:00:00 /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -inhe&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21251     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_pmon_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21253     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_psp0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21257     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_vktm_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21261     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_gen0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21263     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_diag_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21265     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbrm_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21267     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dia0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21269     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_mman_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21271     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbw0_XE&lt;br /&gt;oracle   21273     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_lgwr_XE&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye, this seems like a healthy start; but for more details, there are also a bunch of useful logs under the Oracle directories: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log&lt;br /&gt;ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log&lt;br /&gt;total 20&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1369 Feb 23 22:36 CloneRmanRestore.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 7377 Feb 23 22:36 cloneDBCreation.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1278 Feb 23 22:36 postDBCreation.log&lt;br /&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba  227 Feb 23 22:36 postScripts.log&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, at this point in time, if all had gone according to plan we should be able to connect to our new instance. A typical trick in Oracle is to use &lt;code&gt;tnsping&lt;/code&gt; to validate the setup. For this we need to know what to ping, and that is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/tnsnames.htm#NETRF260&quot;&gt;TNS Names&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ cat /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/network/admin/tnsnames.ora&lt;br /&gt;# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XE =&lt;br /&gt;  (DESCRIPTION =&lt;br /&gt;    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = lorenz)(PORT = 1521))&lt;br /&gt;    (CONNECT_DATA =&lt;br /&gt;      (SERVER = DEDICATED)&lt;br /&gt;      (SERVICE_NAME = XE)&lt;br /&gt;    )&lt;br /&gt;  )&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The magic word is &lt;code&gt;XE&lt;/code&gt; (the net service name, i.e. what we will be connecting against). Now we can simply do: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ . /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh&lt;br /&gt;$ tnsping XE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TNS Ping Utility for Linux: Version 11.2.0.2.0 - Production on 23-FEB-2017 22:52:04&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (c) 1997, 2011, Oracle.

Worth noticing that the first step was to call &lt;code&gt;oracle_env.sh&lt;/code&gt; to bring in all the required environment variables of our Oracle setup. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final test at this stage is to ensure we can connect with SQL Plus. For this we will just rely on the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; user. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ sqlplus SYSTEM@XE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Thu Feb 23 22:56:31 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

We have an absolutely minimal, bare-bones setup of Oracle Express running on Debian Linux. Worth bearing in mind that if you want to make use of SQL Plus from within emacs you must make sure you start emacs on a shell that has all the variables defined in &lt;code&gt;oracle_env.sh&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this first part we simply setup Oracle Express, and the client libraries. We also managed to prove that the setup is vaguely working by connecting to it first at a low-level via TNS ping and then at a proper client level using SQL Plus. The next part will wrap things up with the Oracle setup and then move on to ODB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2017-03-25 Sat 19:54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.1.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The week at Retraction Watch featured the case of a peer review nightmare, and a story about harassment by a would-be scientific critic. Here’s what was happening elsewhere: “Mr. Shiffrin […] said he recognizes the now-very-clear risk of spotlighting reproducibility while a U.S. president and a like-minded Congress appear eager to question the fundamental tenets of […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Over at Data Colada, Uri Simonsohn argues that The Funnel Plot is Invalid.

Funnel plots are a form of scatter diagram which are widely used to visualize possible publication bias in the context of a meta-analysis. In a funnel plot, each data point represents one of the studies in the meta-analysis. The x-axis shows the effect size reported by the study, while the y-axis represents the standard error of the effect size, which is usually inversely related to the sample size.
