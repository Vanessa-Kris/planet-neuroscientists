	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: Q&amp;A with Greg Dunn, neuroscientist turned artist</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19326</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Basket-and-Pyramidals-small-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;For most neuroscientists, long days in the lab pipetting or recording from cells doesn’t inspire one to pick up a paintbrush or sketchpad. But for others, the still-mysterious—and often breathtakingly beautiful—workings of the brain are a source of awe. One such individual is neuroscientist-turned-artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregadunn.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Greg Dunn&lt;/a&gt;. As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, his own research merged with experimental forays into painting, adapting neural forms to the principles of Asian art. Greg joins us to discuss his personal journey to becoming a science artist, his visions for the burgeoning field of science-inspired art, and his advice for aspiring brain-loving artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You followed a unique career path compared to most scientists. Could you share a bit about your transition from scientist to artist and what inspired you to pursue this path?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: I had always needed an artistic outlet in my life, and that became more true than ever when working on very complex biological systems in the lab. When experiments don’t work after a massive expenditure in your efforts, its nice to have something going in parallel that produces something tangible, such as art. I’ve always loved Asian art and the neuroscience images I saw every day in grad school began to merge with that interest, and over the course of several months in my first year of grad school I began to develop my aesthetic in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never felt that I was doing anything at the lab bench that others couldn’t have, but I do feel like I have a useful voice in combining science and art. I hope that my career trajectory serves as an example that specialized scientific knowledge can be applied to many different fields and can help to refine a person’s individual voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art based on science (including neuroscience) is becoming increasingly popular. Why do you suspect this field is so appealing, even to non-scientists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: The brain is the ultimate frontier, it is more fundamentally US than anything else we possess. It is at the fundamental root of everything we could possibly be interested in or do with our lives. It is similar to why astronomy is popular to the lay public in this sense, it holds such great philosophical mysteries to explore. And on top of its conceptual and metaphorical meaning, it is aesthetically beautiful. It is so rich in possibility that it is the sort of thing a person can comfortably spend their whole life exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How, if at all, do you believe that neuroscience-inspired art can serve as an effective outreach tool? Have you witnessed this with your own work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. Art harnesses the power of emotions and direct perceptions in a way that hard data and dry explanations can’t. I deliberately use the power of composition and design to try and make my works appealing on an instinctive level. With the world at our fingertips, people need to be given a reason to care about what they are looking at. Making compelling paintings is about drawing the viewer in initially and then giving them something to chew on in the long term, in this case pondering the nature of the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregadunn.com/self-reflected/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Self Reflected&lt;/a&gt;, my latest work done in collaboration with Dr. Brian Edwards, the point was to demonstrate directly what complexity looks like. Telling somebody that the brain has 86 billion neurons is essentially meaningless because we have no ability to grasp what that number means. Showing somebody directly what the activity of 500,000 neurons looks like at once in a huge, wall sized microetching gives a person a stepping stone to begin to comprehend this astonishing fact. When you then tell them that the brain is actually hundreds of millions of times MORE complicated than that, that’s when a light goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19336&quot; style=&quot;width: 512px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Self-Reflected-in-violets.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19336&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Self-Reflected-in-violets-1024x754.jpg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self Reflected in Violets- the entire Self Reflected microetching under violet and white light– (photo by Greg Dunn and Will Drinker)&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you select the subject matter for your work? Do you have any favorite pieces that were particularly meaningful, or that you’re especially proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m attracted by a variety of compelling images and subjects in neuroscience and meditation. I try to choose subjects that are of interest to different categories of people- some are more specialized neuro, others more general, some more abstract, etc. I’d say that some of my favorites are Basket and Pyramidals as I think it is a clear statement about how neurons fit in the fractal like organization of nature and how they are similar in form to trees, branches, etc that have been painted in gold leaf in Asia for centuries. Cortex in Metallic Pastels also turned out very well and is one of the first examples of my deep reflective gold leaf technique. And, of course, Self Reflected is the most ambitious project of any kind I’d ever attempted. Its scope and attention to detail I think will make it a useful visualization of the brain for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19337&quot; style=&quot;width: 512px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Cortex-in-Metallic-Pastels.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19337&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Cortex-in-Metallic-Pastels-1024x509.jpg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cortex in Metallic Pastels (21K gold, palladium, dye, ink, and metal powders on aluminized panel), 48” X 96”, 2012.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overlapping fields of art and neuroscience are evolving rapidly. How to do you see the field changing over the next decade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Representing brain aesthetics is only one part of it. There is a lot of art/sci work going on in using EEG signals or other neurofeedback devices to direct tasks of various sorts. I am looking forward to seeing some of the work that will come out of collecting unconscious brain activity data that will direct image generation software. I personally plan to try to elucidate states of consciousness that arise in deeper states of meditation through art, as this is more of a subjectively and experientially directed bit of neuroscience art. I think that it is important that art poke our brains into different types of perceptions to teach us a bit more about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any advice for others hoping to pursue a career in science-inspired art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Find your own unique voice! Make a Venn diagram of what your passions are and think hard about how and where they intersect. That is where you will be more effective, motivated, and unique. Really strive to make something categorically new. Don’t always trust your first idea on how to do something, give yourself the time to really iterate an idea in your mind before you realize it. If you are trying to make a living at it, be smart about how to balance your passion with financial realities. Overall, work to convince the world that the barriers between science and art are indistinct at best, and that multifaceted approaches to problems are the most effective solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Retraction watch: When most faculty publish in predatory journals, does the school become “complicit?”</title>

	<link>http://retractionwatch.com/2017/05/09/faculty-publish-predatory-journals-school-become-complicit/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predatory journals – which charge high fees and often offer little-to-no vetting of research quality – are a problem, and lately an easy target for authors eager to spoof the problems of the publishing system. Although many researchers try to steer clear, not all do – a recent paper showed that some top economists publish […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that if you can laugh at it, you can live with it. Is this true? Does the ability to see the funny side of things really act like a psychological shield against stress? &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217699583&quot;&gt;A series of new studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; provides some tentative support for the idea. But the research also illustrates why this is such a difficult topic to study – does humour really reduce stress or is it just easier to see the funny side when you are coping well? And it’s worth remembering the serious risk that if humour is shown to be protective by psychology research – and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; – that those who suffer most from stress will be put under social pressure to help themselves by cheering up, a situation only likely to intensify their distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23667&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Fritz at Clarkson University and her colleagues began by conducting a diary study with 21 women and 1 man diagnosed with the chronic pain condition Fibromyalgia Syndrome. The participants first completed baseline questionnaires about their physical health, psychological state, their tendency to see the funny side of things (for example, they were asked whether they would typically experience mirth in situations such as a waiter spilling a drink over them), how much socialising and support they’d had with friends and relatives recently, and how much they tended to reappraise challenges, such as looking for the positives in a difficult situation. Then the participants spent the next four days completing diary entries several times each day about their physical and emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more pronounced the participants’ sense of humour, the lower their psychological distress at the start of the study and the better their physical symptoms through the diary stage. But against the researchers’ expectations, the apparent benefits of humour weren’t explained by sense of humour being linked with a tendency to reappraise situations, nor to better social relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study involved just over 100 undergrad students answering questions about their psychological and emotional state, their tendency to find things funny and make jokes, and they also recalled a previous distressing event and how much it continued to affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the more that the students said the past trauma continued to affect them, the higher they scored for signs of psychological distress. But crucially this wasn’t the case for the students who were most inclined to humour and seeing the funny side of things – they said the trauma was still affecting their lives, but based on their emotional scores, they weren’t experiencing heightened distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious problem with these first two studies is that it might simply be that the less distressed participants were better able to experience humour, rather than their inclination for humour reducing their stress levels or, in the case of the first study, their physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study attempted to overcome this methodological problem and involved students affected by the September 11 terror attacks in New York.  The students completed baseline psychological measures one month after the attacks, including scoring their disposition for humour (and their humour style), and then two months later, they answered more questions about their levels of psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a tendency for self-enhancing humour (taking a cheerful perspective on life) to be associated with reduced stress over time – though direct evidence for this did not reach statistical significance in their analysis – and that this was related to a greater inclination to reappraise situations – finding the positives where possible. In contrast, self-defeating humour (disparaging oneself) was associated with more distress and less reappraisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fritz and her colleagues said a consistent pattern had emerged from their studies: “positive humour use predicted reduced psychological distress in response to stressful events”. However, the evidence for this conclusion seems weak: only the final study had the methodology needed to identify a causal role for humour in reducing distress, and in fact it failed, statistically, to establish that a stronger inclination for humour at baseline was directly associated with less distress at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the persistent lay belief in the physical health benefits of humour use, it is critical that we understand the magnitude of its effect,” the researchers concluded. Far more robust research is needed before we reach that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217699583&quot;&gt;Humor Use Moderates the Relation of Stressful Life Events With Psychological Distress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A new paper in the prestigious journal PNAS contains a rather glaring blooper.

The paper, from Oxford University researchers Eiluned Pearce et al., is about the relationship between genes and social behaviour. The blooper is right there in the abstract, which states that &quot;three neuropeptides (β-endorphin, oxytocin, and dopamine) play particularly important roles&quot; in human sociality. But dopamine is not a neuropeptide.



Neither are serotonin or testosterone, but throughout the paper, Pea</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the second time, a journal has quickly retracted a study that suggested vaccines raise the risk of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The study first raised a furor last year, prompting a Frontiers journal to quickly retract it. After it was republished in the Journal of Translational Science this month, that journal has also retracted it. […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: HIV Medications Linked to Increase in Alzheimer’s Disease Protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22534</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of drugs called protease inhibitors have been lifesaving for people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, these medications come with a long list of side effects that may include impairments in cognitive function. How protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects has remained a mystery for some time. New research from the University of Pennsylvania is beginning to shed light on the answer, and it lies in a protein that is one of the main components of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease inhibitors work to treat HIV by preventing replication of the HIV virus. The drugs block an enzyme called HIV protease, which cleaves the protein precursors required to produce new viral particles. Inhibiting HIV protease thus prevents the spread of the virus throughout the body. Since the approval of these drugs for clinical use in 1995, the rate of deaths from HIV has declined drastically. A typical HIV patient takes a combination of protease inhibitors and other medications to counter the development of drug-resistant HIV strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects caused by protease inhibitors are common. These include dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome, and, potentially, cognitive dysfunction. HIV-associated cognitive disorders, abbreviated HAND, include a spectrum of symptoms such as forgetfulness, confusion, and behavioral and motor changes. While the HIV virus itself is believed to play a role in causing HAND symptoms, the drugs used to treat the virus, including protease inhibitors, have also been implicated in the development of HAND. Until now, little was known about how protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects, and therefore, how such symptoms might be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research from the University of Pennsylvania has shed new light on the mechanism by which protease inhibitors might impair cognitive function. Work by Kelly Jordan-Sciutto and colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated that protease inhibitors increase levels of the peptide beta amyloid in the brain. Excessive levels of beta amyloid can impair the way brain cells function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta amyloid protein is commonly known for playing a major role in Alzeheimer’s disease and several other neurological diseases, including Lewy body dementia, inclusion body myositis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In Alzheimer’s disease, beta amyloid forms plaques or clumps of protein that give rise to deposits outside of brain cells, causing impairments in cell function. Increased levels of beta amyloid and its precursor protein – amyloid precursor protein (APP) – have also been observed in the brains of HIV-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan-Sciutto’s team had previously found that HIV drugs such as protease inhibitors can be toxic to neurons. They showed that some of these toxic effects were caused by damage to the DNA of the cell’s energy-generating cells, called mitochondria, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress is known to activate the cell’s unfolded protein response (UPR) that increase the level of a protein called BACE1. In turn, BACE1 increases levels of beta amyloid by cleaving its precursor protein, APP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan-Sciutto theorized that because protease inhibitors cause ER stress, they might also increase beta amyloid by activating the UPR, and thus BACE1 and APP downstream. Their most recent study, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, explored these questions further by examining whether protease inhibitors change the levels of beta amyloid and other cellular proteins that regulate its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, a group of macaques were infected with the form of HIV found in monkeys, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Monkeys were then treated with either a cocktail of protease inhibitors or a placebo. The brains of the monkeys were examined 160 days following infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the experiments showed that SIV-infected monkeys treated with protease inhibitors had much higher levels of beta amyloid in their neurons than infected monkeys who did not receive the drug. Infected drug-treated monkeys also showed increased levels of the amyloid beta precursor protein. As Jordan-Sciutto predicted, these monkeys also had increased levels of BACE1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 90% of the placebo-treated animals developed signs of neurological dysfunction by 12 weeks of treatment, whereas the animals treated with the drug cocktail did not display any of these symptoms. This raises the question of whether the observed increases in amyloid beta protein in the drug-treated animals are pathological; that is, whether this amount of beta amyloid can cause symptoms. To date, the researchers have not studied monkeys treated with protease inhibitors in the absence of SIV infection in order to assess the effects of the drug alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To partly address this problem, the researchers also studied the effect of protease inhibitors on the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cultured cells derived from rat glial cells and human fetal tissue. Protease inhibitors increased the expression of markers associated with UPR activation and increased BACE1 in the cultured cells, which led to an increase in the cleavage of APP and subsequent cell damage. Conversely, treatment with a drug that inhibited BACE1 prevented this cell damage. Finally, the researchers showed that another enzyme, called PERK, was also a key player in the unfolded protein response that led to the increase in BACE1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These novel findings provide a clear mechanism for protease inhibitor brain toxicity in patients with HIV, suggesting that these drugs may in fact contribute to the development of HIV-associated cognitive disorders by increasing beta amyloid. Despite these neurotoxic effects, protease inhibitors will remain a mainstay for the treatment of HIV, as they have profoundly improved the quality of life and extended the lifespan of patients. The results of these studies suggest that potential new therapies targeting the proteins BACE1 and PERK could prevent the cognitive side effects of protease inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some common-sense reasons for thinking that being raised without siblings will have meaningful psychological consequences – after all, “only children” are likely to get more attention from their parents than kids with sibs, but at the same time they miss out on the social experience that comes from sharing, playing and competing with brothers or sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest study to look into this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9530-9?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain Imaging and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, comes from China where the government’s one-child family planning programme has led to a huge increase in the numbers of only children. Junyi Yang and his colleagues scanned the brains of hundreds university students, about half of whom were only children and also tested their personality, creativity and intelligence. The only children outperformed the participants with siblings on creativity, but they scored lower on trait agreeableness – psychological differences that appeared to coincide with relevant structural differences in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23583&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test of creativity – the verbal part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking&quot;&gt;the Torrance Test&lt;/a&gt; – was fairly comprehensive and involved the participants doing things like coming up with unusual uses for cardboard boxes, improving a toy elephant and thinking about the consequences of an imaginary scenario. Personality was assessed using a fairly standard self-report questionnaire. And the brain imaging scan was used to look for group differences in grey matter volume in specific brain areas that the researchers thought might be relevant based on past research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only children’s superior performance on the creativity tasks tied in with their having more grey matter, on average, in the supramarginal gyrus of their brains than the participants with siblings (even after factoring out group differences in family income and parents’ education). This is a region in the parietal lobe that Yang and his team said has previously linked with mental flexibility and imagination; also in this study, across all participants, grey matter volume in this brain region correlated with creativity scores. The researchers speculated only children’s apparent superior creativity may be related to the greater contact they’d had with their parents, and perhaps their parents’ having heightened expectations for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the only children also scored lower on agreeableness – a trait that’s associated with warmth and concern for others. This seemed to tie in with their having less grey matter in the medial prefrontal cortex (and across the sample, more grey matter here correlated with trait agreeability) – a region at the front of the brain that’s known to be involved in thinking about the self in relation to others. The researchers speculated this could be explained by only children receiving excessive attention and praise from parents and other family members, and having a lack of social practice with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always interesting when data comes in that speaks to some of our folk assumptions about human psychology – in this case, how the kind of upbringing we have shapes the kind of people we become. But it’s worth treating these new findings with some caution, especially given the recent, rigorous studies that have suggested birth order is not linked to personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the snapshot nature of the new findings, with measures only taken at one time point, and the lack of diversity in the current sample – highly educated young people in China – being an only child is also heavily confounded with other factors like parents’ social and educational background and genes inherited from parents (although the researchers made some effort to account for some of this). Also, it’s always risky trying to interpret the meaning of structural brain differences.

	<description>A paper just published in Nature Human Behaviour makes some big claims about the brain. It's called Evidence for a large-scale brain system supporting allostasis and interoception in humans, but how much is evidence and how much is speculation?



The authors, Ian R. Kleckner and colleagues of Northeastern University, argue that a core function of the brain is allostasis, which they define as the process by which the brain &quot;efficiently maintains energy regulation in the body&quot;. Allostasis ent</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: How data can save lives: Informatics for Health 2017</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/05/data-can-save-lives-informatics-health-2017/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Professor Iain Buchan, the Farr Institute and Dame Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/datasaveslives-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to ignore the proliferation of information technology in all aspects of everyday life with the healthcare environment being no exception. &lt;a href=&quot;http://informaticsforhealth.org/&quot;&gt;Informatics for Health 2017&lt;/a&gt; brought together leaders in the field performing cutting edge research into how we can use information technology in all kinds of healthcare settings as well as in medical research. One of the overarching messages was that the use and re-use of healthcare data could revolutionize the understanding of human health and disease with the phrase ‘data saves lives’ prominent throughout the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaining the public’s trust and developing the informatics workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the sessions were focused on the work that is being carried out in the UK, specifically the North of England, which has become a hub for informatics research with projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/&quot;&gt;Connected Health Cities&lt;/a&gt; headed up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/john-ainsworth(9ad38019-9856-4c5d-acea-2614976f8d74).html&quot;&gt;John Ainsworth&lt;/a&gt;. In a panel session, he described the main aims of the project which center on the use of information technology to improve health services for patients in Northern England. Another key aim of the project is to establish the public’s trust which will allow researchers to use their data. In his talk during one of the early panel sessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Buchan.html&quot;&gt;Iain Buchan&lt;/a&gt; also highlighted the importance of obtaining trust from participants. Such trust is often won by demonstrating how the results of the research will be of benefit to the patient population, and as such tends to be easier to obtain from a smaller community of patients who will be able to see the direct benefit of the research to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of sessions and talks also highlighted the importance of the workforce, made up of those working in both discovery science and the healthcare setting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/person/dr-martin-bardsley&quot;&gt;Martin Bardsley&lt;/a&gt; spoke about the need to ensure that we have enough informatics experts and analysts who can handle and analyze healthcare data. Once the research is being put into practice it’s also imperative that the workforce on the front-line of healthcare is on-board with the implementation of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of informatics in healthcare: from patients to research and back again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme at the conference centered around a circular model that has been proposed in a recent article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/23/4/791/2198415/An-informatics-research-agenda-to-support&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which summarizes how informatics can and should be used in medicine. The model puts the patient at the start and the end of the circle; with data collected during their care being used in research leading to the generation of new knowledge which is then fed back into the system leading to changes in healthcare policy, thereby improving the care that the patient experiences. In the first of the plenary talks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labmedinfo.org/people/bellazzi&quot;&gt;Riccardo Bellazi&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pavia, discussed one of the key considerations in this circle; the variety observed in biomedical big data and how this can be harnessed in translational and clinical research as well as in the care of patients. This large variety comes from the sheer quantity of data that is now being collected and methods are required to deal with data on this scale at every stage, including data storage, integration and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8941&quot; style=&quot;width: 1390px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Riccardo Bellazi, University of Pavia&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8941&quot; height=&quot;1136&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/RB2-e1493973390887.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1380&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Riccardo Bellazi, University of Pavia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another of the plenary talks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frank.van.harmelen/&quot;&gt;Frank van Harmelen&lt;/a&gt; of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam spoke about how linked data can improve healthcare systems. There has been steady progress in the linking of data-sets on the web to create data networks that contain billions of facts and rules that can be used to find information very quickly. Despite these advances, such systems are not so common in the healthcare setting. Professor van Harmelen presented some ways that these data networks could be used in healthcare, for example in the organization of data on FDA approved drugs including side effects and adverse reactions. From his presentation, it’s clear that there is some way to go before these ideas can be harnessed fully in the healthcare setting and there is real scope for improvement in the flow and organization of health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the keynote talks was given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-psychology/people/Susan_Michie&quot;&gt;Susan Michie&lt;/a&gt; of University College London who presented her work on the Human Behavior-Change Project, which aims to develop methods for systematically analysing human behavior and how this can affect health. This project is an example of the potential power of information technology in medical research as it will build an Artificial Intelligence system to analyze the global literature and extract information on human behavior in order to generate evidence that will then inform researchers, policy makers and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8943&quot; style=&quot;width: 3357px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Susan Michie, University College London talks about the Human Behavior-Change Project&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8943&quot; height=&quot;2615&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/SM2-e1493973513521.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3347&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Susan Michie, University College London talks about the Human Behavior-Change Project&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final keynote speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientslikeme.com/members/view/18944&quot;&gt;Sally Okun&lt;/a&gt;, rounded off the conference with a talk focusing on health technology from the patient perspective. She is Vice President for Advocacy, Policy and Patient Safety at PatientsLikeMe, an online patient centered research network. The network currently has around half a million users and stores information on each individual in a similar way to an electronic health record. One of the future aims of the network is to provide a ‘digital avatar’ for each patient which can be used for decision making, for example for selecting treatment options, by considering all of the information that is stored on that person. It was fitting to end the conference with a talk focusing on how patients can directly benefit from the use of information technology, which is the ultimate driving force for the research being carried out in the medical informatics field.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of work to clean up the scientific literature, and some researchers and organizations deserve special recognition. That’s why we’ve established a “doing the right thing” category when we see praise-worthy progress in individual retractions, and have now gone a step further: We’ve created the DiRT Award, a new annual prize to […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Assessing real-time Zika risk in the United States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=8949</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/05/assessing-real-time-zika-risk-in-the-united-states/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Presenting a simulation in a visualization lab&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/SpencerFox-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring rains and rising temperatures came early this year, signaling the start of mosquito season and the threat of new Zika outbreaks in the United States. Imagine that you are a public health official in Houston, Texas. You know that parts of the city may be vulnerable to Zika spread and that at least 81 people have arrived in the metropolitan area infected with Zika since 2015. The challenge is that most Zika infections are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed by doctors or reported to public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zika could spread &lt;em&gt;silently&lt;/em&gt; in Houston long before it’s detected. Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive notification that a single individual with no travel history to Zika affected regions has tested positive for Zika, signaling that local transmission has occurred. Should you initiate costly interventions, including mosquito control and educational campaigns, or wait for more cases to arise? How would a second case change your decision? Would your response be different if you were a public health official in Lubbock, Texas instead of Houston? Depending on your location, the presence of two cases can reflect an anomalous low probability event or indicate an imminent or ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent article: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2394-9&quot;&gt;Assessing real-time Zika risk in the United States&lt;/a&gt;”, we present a computational model intended to help public health officials navigate such challenges and assess epidemic risks as cases accumulate within their jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model considers the two prerequisites for a Zika outbreak: the arrival of infected travelers and the prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Aedes &lt;/em&gt;mosquito species capable of transmitting disease to uninfected people. If infected travelers are the “sparks”, then mosquito bites provide the fuel for a full-blown outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Texas as a high risk case study, we find that the Zika importation rate can be predicted from local tourism spending, and that mosquito-borne transmission depends on climatic and socioeconomic conditions, with the highest risks occurring in low GDP, high temperature regions.  By simulating these processes, in conjunction with the unpredictable nature of disease transmission and Zika’s low reporting rate, we found that the 254 counties of Texas vary enormously in risk. Most counties have almost no chance of a Zika outbreak while a few high risk counties have 60-fold greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when and where should public health officials trigger interventions? In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prudently recommended a two case threshold and Texas Department of State and Health Services (DSHS) conservatively opted to reduce the threshold to a single reported locally-transmitted case of Zika. Indeed, during the small November 2017 Zika outbreak in Cameron County, Texas DSHS intervened immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions. High risk regions, like the Houston Metropolitan region and Rio Grande Valley should certainly have early (one or two case) triggers.  However, given economic and societal costs of Zika intervention, lower risk regions like the Dallas or Austin metropolitan areas might consider less stringent thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter mosquito season in the Southern US, this model can be used readily for public health planning and real-time risk assessments. Zika prevalence across the Americas is considerably lower today than this time last year; during the first 15 weeks of 2016, the weekly prevalence peaked around 40,000 cases per week compared to less than 2,000 cases per week this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has translated into fewer infected travelers arriving in Texas, down from 33 by May of 2016, to only 11 as of May in 2017.   Thus, as we optimistically look towards a mosquito season with fewer Zika ‘sparks’, this framework can provide data-driven insight for anticipating and managing risk in vulnerable regions of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ginnysmithscience.com/&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, in Connecticut, a series of infamous experiments were taking place. The volunteers believed they were involved in an investigation into learning and memory, and that they would be administering shocks to a test subject whenever he answered questions incorrectly. But despite pretences, the scientist behind the research, Stanley Milgram, wasn’t actually interested in learning. The real topic of study? Obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milgram recorded how far his participants were willing to go when told to deliver larger and larger shocks. In one version of the study, 26 out of 40 participants continued to the highest shock level – two steps beyond the button labelled “Danger: severe shock”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was 50 years ago – surely the same wouldn’t happen if the experiment were conducted today? That’s what a group of researchers from SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poland aimed to find out, in a “partial replication” of Milgram &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23551&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s ethical guidelines meant Dariusz Doliński and his colleagues couldn’t recreate Milgram’s experiment completely. However, they took advantage of the fact that in the original experiments, the 10th shock level seemed especially important, a kind of “point of no return”. The overwhelming majority of the participants who went this far continued to the end of the experiment, administering the 30th and final shock level, which they thought was lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Doliński and his team used just 10 shock levels, to speed things up and reduce the stress of the task on their 80 participants (aged 18 to 69; attempts were made to exclude those likely to be familiar with the original Milgram research). The researchers assumed that the portion of participants who agreed to administer this 10th shock (labelled 450 volts) would give a good assessment of the proportion who would have been prepared to go all the way in the original version of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Milgram, and other replication attempts in the US and elsewhere, the team found the majority (90 per cent in this case) of “teachers” were willing to continue to the highest shock level, even after hearing screams of pain from the “learner”. The researchers also went a step further, attempting to find out whether the sex of the “learner” had any effect on the “teacher’s” behaviour. However because so few “teachers” refused to continue to the end, there was too small a sample size to see if disobedience was higher when the ‘learner’ was male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this tell us? First, it suggests that despite the so-called replication crisis currently gripping psychology, there are still some classic findings that are reliable, albeit that there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/&quot;&gt;fierce debate&lt;/a&gt; over how to interpret participants’ behaviour and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/02/16/milgrams-obedience-studies-not-about-obedience-after-all/&quot;&gt;whether it truly reflects obedience or not&lt;/a&gt;. Second, it highlights the fact that obedience – if that is what’s on display – is common across cultures. Poland, and other Eastern European countries around it, have experienced huge political changes over the last 80 years, with heavily controlled communism giving way to democratic freedoms. Now, the pendulum is starting to swing again, with the socially conservative “Law and Justice” party winning the 2015 Polish elections and remaining hugely popular. But despite all these changes, and the issues that have come with them, the instinct to submit to authority still seems to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060&quot;&gt;Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Retraction watch: After researcher is convicted of sexual assault, journal retracts her co-author’s paper</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://retractionwatch.com/?p=49840</guid>
	<link>http://retractionwatch.com/2017/05/04/author-sexually-assaulted-journal-retracts-paper-duplication/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A disability journal has retracted a paper supposedly penned by a man with severe disabilities, citing duplication.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What do Kentucky Fried Chicken and scientific publishing have in common? Last month, the fast food chain objected to the use of the phrase “Finger Lakin’ Good” by a man in New York, claiming the phrase was too similar to KFC’s familiar “Finger Lickin’ Good” motto. This week, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) forced an […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists studying how our expectations change over time have observed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22985178&quot;&gt;our hopes tend to dip the nearer we get to receiving some feedback&lt;/a&gt;, be that an exam result, sports score or health test outcome. They call this “bracing” and there’s evidence we do it more in some situations than others, for example the more severe the potential outcome and the more personally relevant, the more we brace. But do some of us brace more than others, and specifically, do optimists brace as much as pessimists? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12289/full&quot;&gt;a series of nine studies&lt;/a&gt; published recently in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23486&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Kate Sweeny’s and Angelica Falkenstein’s studies involved tests for signs of bracing and tests of either dispositional optimism (measured by agreement with statements like “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best”) and/or pessimism (measured by agreement with statements like “I spend lots of time imagining what could go wrong”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most compelling studies involved law students, who were asked to predict their performance on an upcoming bar exam, and then to predict their results one month and one day before the results were due in. Other studies involved psychology undergrads who were asked to forecast how well they thought they’d done on an intelligence test, a maths test, or how attractive they would be rated by other students. Crucially, sometimes they were asked to make these predictions knowing that their actual performance or attractiveness feedback would be given to them imminently (a set-up designed to induce bracing), while other times they were told their results would never be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the studies, even though optimists had higher expectations overall, they showed just as much bracing as pessimists. It remains to be seen whether these results will generalise to non-student samples. And there must be doubts over the realism of the studies that compared students’ predictions in a no-feedback versus imminent feedback context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Sweeny and Falkenstein said it makes sense that bracing seems to be such a common strategy, even among optimists. Although optimism as an enduring trait has known benefits for our health and wellbeing – for instance, optimists tend to be happier and enjoy better health – Sweeny and Falkenstein pointed out that “well-timed pessimism” is also advantageous:  “after all, if people expect the worst, they can hardly be unpleasantly surprised and it causes little or no distress if embraced only in the final moments before feedback.” They added, “pessimism at the moment of truth also minimizes the likelihood of looking foolish if things do not turn out as hoped, particularly if people express their newfound pessimism to others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say there ares no differences between individuals in their tendency to brace. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232471180_Abandoning_Unrealistic_Optimism_Performance_Estimates_and_the_Temporal_Proximity_of_Self-Relevant_Feedback&quot;&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that people with higher self-esteem are less likely to brace, perhaps because they are less worried about looking foolish when outcomes don’t match their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12289/full&quot;&gt;Even Optimists Get the Blues: Interindividual Consistency in the Tendency to Brace for the Worst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Is oxytocin really the love and trust chemical? Or is it just the hype hormone? A new paper suggests that many studies of the relationship between oxytocin and behaviors such as trust have been flawed.





The paper is a meta-analysis just published by Norwegian researchers Mathias Valstad and colleagues. Valstad et al. found that the level of oxytocin in human blood, often used as a proxy measure of brain oxytocin, has no relation to central nervous system oxytocin levels under normal co</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1960s, Nobel-prize winning research shook our understanding of what it means to be a conscious entity. Epilepsy patients who’d had the thick bundle of nerves connecting their two brain hemispheres either severed or removed (as a drastic treatment for their epilepsy) responded in laboratory tasks as if they had two separate minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an unsettling idea that has appeared in psychology textbooks for decades. But dig into the original studies and you’ll find the evidence for split brains leading to split minds was mostly descriptive. Now a team of researchers led by Yair Pinto at the University of Amsterdam has conducted systematic testing of two split-brain patients over several years, specifically to find out whether the division of their brains has also separated their consciousness. In fact, the results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/140/5/1231/2951052/Split-brain-divided-perception-but-undivided?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, suggest their consciousness remains unified. It may be time to rewrite the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23371&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the original observations and the new results, it helps to revisit a little basic neurobiology. There’s a lot of cross-wiring in the brain (the formal term is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decussation&quot;&gt;decussation&lt;/a&gt;), which means that the left side of space is processed by the brain’s right hemisphere and the right side of space is processed by the left hemisphere, which in most people is also the hemisphere that controls speech. Similarly, the left arm is controlled by the right hemisphere, and the right arm by the left hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a healthy person, the two hemispheres communicate extensively across a thick bundle of neurons called the corpus callosum (there are other lesser connections) meaning information from either side of space is shared and available to your unified consciousness. Consequently, if your right hemisphere sees something in the left side of space, your left hemisphere (controlling speech) can still name it or point to it with your right arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in split brain patients with a severed or removed corpus callosum, the original reports suggested that they were unable to verbally describe anything appearing on the left side of space, nor could their right hand point to it, or point to a picture matching it, even though their right hemisphere knew what was there (it could use the left hand to point to the target or to a picture that matched it). It’s as if the patients had two separate minds: one half knew what was on one side of space even while the other half was ignorant. It wasn’t only their brains that were split, their consciousness was too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Sperry, the scientist who won the Nobel prize for this work, hinted that there were exceptions to this split-mind phenomenon, but before now no one seems to have tested the idea systematically. For the new research, Pinto and his colleagues conducted five thorough experiments with two split-brain patients. Each experiment was really a variation on the same theme. Either verbally or by pointing, the patient had to assess the position of, or identify, pictures or shapes that appeared on one side or other of a computer screen, or they had to compare shapes or pictures on either side of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were impaired: they were unable to make comparisons between shapes or pictures that appeared simultaneously on either side of space. And when identifying or localising a picture or shape on just one side of space, their accuracy varied depending on which side of the screen it appeared on – suggesting the two sides were processed separately at a perceptual level. But here’s the critical finding: regardless of whether the target shapes or pictures were located on the left or right side of space, the patients were able to report on them by any modality – by speech, with their right hand or left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, despite their brain hemispheres being largely separated, information processed by one side or other did at some stage become available at a unified conscious level, which the patients could report on verbally or act on with either arm. Pinto and his colleagues pointed out that not only does this contradict established textbook accounts of split-brain patients, but also raises problems for contemporary theories of consciousness, such as the Global Workspace theory, which is predicated on the idea that information reaches consciousness when it is broadcast across the brain hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests were conducted many years after the patients underwent their radical brain surgery so it remains possible that the original split minds phenomenon is real, but only transient. If so, the compensatory mechanisms that overcome the phenomenon remain unknown. Changes to neurosurgical practices mean that split-brain patients are rare today and few of those tested in the original research are still alive. This means time is running out to explore these fascinating questions further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that severing the cortical connections between the two brain hemispheres does not seem to lead to two independent conscious agents within one brain,” the researchers said. “This raises the intriguing possibility that even without massive communication between the cerebral hemispheres, and thus increases in modularity, unity in consciousness and responding is largely preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;public domain&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Helmet-brain-double-public-domain-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the rate of emergency department visits for sports and recreation related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) more than doubled in children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/get_the_facts.html&quot;&gt;In 2012, over 329,000 children and adolescents in the US have received medical treatment for TBI&lt;/a&gt;. This statistic becomes more troubling when we consider a significant number of individuals likely do not seek medical services. TBIs are clearly a public health concern and have captured the attention of the public, media, sports community, and medical healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8934&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;public domain&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8934&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Emergency-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;public domain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary to this attention, an increasing amount of literature examining the lingering effects of previous concussion(s) now exists; however, this literature frequently demonstrates mixed results. Unfortunately, the existing research also frequently contains insufficient sample sizes, lack of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, absence of case matching, and/or mixing of sexes in the groups examined. In our recent study, we attempted to address these limitations by utilizing a large sample database of over 26,000 athletes aged 10 to 19 years, extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a case match design. Participants were grouped according to sex and number of previous self-reported concussions and then case matched on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-way analysis of variance was used to examine overall differences between concussion groups on symptoms reported and scores obtained on the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT ®) neurocognitive battery composites. A between-subjects main effect was not found for any of the neurocognitive profiles (e.g., verbal memory, visual memory, and reaction time) for males or females; however, results demonstrated male participants reported significantly increased symptoms of dizziness, fogginess, concentration difficulties, and memory problems as the number of self-reported previous concussions increased. A similar trend was not found for female participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8935&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Erik Drost Flickr&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8935&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Erik-Drost-Flickr-300x254.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Erik Drost, Flickr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, our finding that male adolescents with a self-reported history of concussions are suffering from greater daily discomfort than their non-concussed peers is a cause for concern. While it is not clear why a similar trend was not observed in females, several possible explanations exist, including: male athletes are known to underreport symptoms and are less likely to be diagnosed with a concussion unless relatively severe or higher number of symptoms are present; males endorsing more symptoms may also be more likely to connect their experiences to a higher number of past concussions; males are more likely to engage in sports associated with increased violent and aggressive acts (e.g., football and wrestling); and previous research suggesting estrogen and progesterone are neuroprotective and may aid in recovery post-concussion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7925843&quot;&gt;Roof, Duvdevani, Braswell, &amp;amp; Stein, 1994&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222128&quot;&gt;Stein &amp;amp; Hoffman, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, our findings appear to contradict a significant portion of the existing literature that did not utilize stringent inclusion and exclusionary criteria, had insufficient sample sizes, and mixed sexes in the groups examined. Consequently, it becomes more likely that these studies’ findings may at least be partially explained by confounding variables (e.g., differences among males and female participants as well as psychiatric diagnoses affecting symptoms reported and neurocognitive performance). Due to the role confounding factors may be playing in the existing research’s results, we recommend use of caution when interpreting and generalizing research that utilizes a relatively lenient inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., mixing of sexes and not screening for learning disorder diagnoses and ADHD) and insufficient sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our results do not indicate lasting neurocognitive changes following concussion, it is important to note &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754723&quot;&gt;the ImPACT® may lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity to measure chronic changes in cognition&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it is also important to note that the information we analyzed was obtained by self-report. As a result, our study does not allow for an inference of causation between concussion history and persistent neurocognitive impairment or post-concussive symptoms. Despite this, our results did provide evidence of persistent negative subjective effects that correlate with number of self-reported concussions, suggesting future research in this area is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Protein–phospholipid interplay revealed with crystals of a calcium pump</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22357</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gQ3fYmG0b-k/nature22357</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The lipid bilayer has so far eluded visualization by conventional crystallographic methods, severely limiting our understanding of phospholipid– and protein–phospholipid interactions. Here we describe electron density maps for crystals of Ca2+-ATPase in four different states obtained by X-ray solvent contrast modulation. These maps resolve the entire first layer of phospholipids surrounding the transmembrane helices, although less than half of them are hydrogen-bonded to protein residues. Phospholipids follow the movements of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the bilayer. Unexpectedly, the entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching. Thus, phospholipid–Arg/Lys and phospholipid–Trp interactions have distinct functional roles in the dynamics of ion pumps and, presumably, membrane proteins in general.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease, is associated with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4+ T-cell self-epitope derived from the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3135–145). While HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1 allele is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that autoreactive α3135–145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture disease and, in α3135–145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, α3135–145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the α3135–145 epitope in different binding registers. HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR15 transgenic mice exhibit a conventional T-cell phenotype (Tconv) that secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice are predominantly CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing tolerogenic cytokines. HLA-DR1-induced Treg cells confer resistance to disease in HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice. HLA-DR15+ and HLA-DR1+ healthy human donors display altered α3135–145-specific T-cell antigen receptor usage, HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3− Tconv and HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3+CD25hiCD127lo Treg dominant phenotypes. Moreover, patients with Goodpasture disease display a clonally expanded α3135–145-specific CD4+ T-cell repertoire. Accordingly, we provide a mechanistic basis for the dominantly protective effect of HLA in autoimmune disease, whereby HLA polymorphism shapes the relative abundance of self-epitope specific Treg cells that leads to protection or causation of autoimmunity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Core Mediator structure at 3.4 Å extends model of transcription initiation complex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Mediator is a multiprotein co-activator that binds the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) and regulates RNA polymerase (Pol) II. The Mediator head and middle modules form the essential core Mediator (cMed), whereas the tail and kinase modules play regulatory roles. The architecture of Mediator and its position on the PIC are known, but atomic details are limited to Mediator subcomplexes. Here we report the crystal structure of the 15-subunit cMed from Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure shows an unaltered head module, and reveals the intricate middle module, which we show is globally required for transcription. Sites of known Mediator mutations cluster at the interface between the head and middle modules, and in terminal regions of the head subunits Med6 (ref. 16) and Med17 (ref. 17) that tether the middle module. The structure led to a model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cMed that could be combined with the 3.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the core PIC (cPIC). The resulting atomic model of the cPIC–cMed complex informs on interactions of the submodules forming the middle module, called beam, knob, plank, connector, and hook. The hook is flexibly linked to Mediator by a conserved hinge and contacts the transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH) kinase that phosphorylates the carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and was recently positioned on the PIC. The hook also contains residues that crosslink to the CTD and reside in a previously described cradle. These results provide a framework for understanding Mediator function, including its role in stimulating CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop</title>

 Persistent neural activity maintains information that connects past and future events. Models of persistent activity often invoke reverberations within local cortical circuits, but long-range circuits could also contribute. Neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) have been shown to have selective persistent activity that instructs future actions. The ALM is connected bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and ventral anterior–lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect. Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation across multiple brain areas.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: FGF-dependent metabolic control of vascular development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22322</guid>

 Blood and lymphatic vasculatures are intimately involved in tissue oxygenation and fluid homeostasis maintenance. Assembly of these vascular networks involves sprouting, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Recent studies have suggested that changes in cellular metabolism are important to these processes. Although much is known about vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent regulation of vascular development and metabolism, little is understood about the role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in this context. Here we identify FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling as a critical regulator of vascular development. This is achieved by FGF-dependent control of c-MYC (MYC) expression that, in turn, regulates expression of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2). A decrease in HK2 levels in the absence of FGF signalling inputs results in decreased glycolysis, leading to impaired endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Pan-endothelial- and lymphatic-specific Hk2 knockouts phenocopy blood and/or lymphatic vascular defects seen in Fgfr1/Fgfr3 double mutant mice, while HK2 overexpression partly rescues the defects caused by suppression of FGF signalling. Thus, FGF-dependent regulation of endothelial glycolysis is a pivotal process in developmental and adult vascular growth and development.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Non-equivalence of Wnt and R-spondin ligands during Lgr5+ intestinal stem-cell self-renewal</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22313</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium—an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin ligands (RSPO1–RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4–LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and induce intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However, gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise control of tissue regeneration.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Wnt proteins modulate cell proliferation and differentiation and the self-renewal of stem cells by inducing β-catenin-dependent signalling through the Wnt receptor frizzled (FZD) and the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 to regulate cell fate decisions and the growth and repair of several tissues. The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD–LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic β-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22073</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Although interactions between the thalamus and cortex are critical for cognitive function, the exact contribution of the thalamus to these interactions remains unclear. Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the thalamus, but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show, by investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically, mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity, enabling rule-specific neural sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with this notion, broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and behavioural performance, whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves both. Overall, our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience; thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function, which is dissociable from categorical information relay, indicates that the thalamus has a much broader role in cognition than previously thought.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Whole-genome landscapes of major melanoma subtypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Melanoma of the skin is a common cancer only in Europeans, whereas it arises in internal body surfaces (mucosal sites) and on the hands and feet (acral sites) in people throughout the world. Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of stereotypes about the kind of people in different professions. Lawyers and business people are often caricatured as ruthless and self-interested, especially when compared to the kind of folk who enter professions usually seen as caring, such as nursing or psychology. To test the truth of these stereotypes, a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917302817&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; surveyed the “Dark Triad” and “Big Five” traits of hundreds of Danish students enrolled to begin studying either psychology, politics, business/economics or law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale was that by testing students’ personalities after they’d chosen their subject, but before they’d begun their studies, or careers, the researchers would uncover evidence for whether people with certain kinds of personalities are drawn to particular professions, as opposed to, or as well as, those professions shaping their personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Vedel and her colleagues found that psychology students scored “substantially” lower on Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism) than business and law students. Business/economics students scored the highest of all on the Dark Triad. Law and politics students’ scores were very similar to each other: lower than business but higher than psychology. In terms of the Big Five personality traits, psychology students scored “much higher” than the other student groups of Agreeableness and Openness and Neuroticism (replicating &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/12/the-personality-differences-between-students-studying-different-academic-subjects/&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published last year). These subject differences remained even when comparing just male students, or just female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The choice of academic major and career is a complex decision involving many different factors, but the present study suggests that personality traits are at least part of this decision process,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the launch of the latest addition to the BMC series.&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is now considering article submissions on all aspects of prevention, treatment and management of rheumatic diseases. To find out more, please read this blog post introducing the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/21/bmc-rheumatology-new-addition-bmc-series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Plant Biology&lt;/em&gt;: Video of the month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers from Italy have investigated how the environment can have a profound effect on the appearance, texture and flavor of tomato fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1008-4&quot;&gt;full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0015-0&quot;&gt;Rediscovery of the African wolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wolf (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster)&lt;/em&gt; is a medium-sized canid with wolf-like characters. Because its appearance resembles that of the golden jackal, specimens have long been assigned to golden jackal. Viranta and colleagues have now carried out a taxonomic investigation of the African wolf. A skull and skin taxonomy assessment revealed that &lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster&lt;/em&gt; is not a golden jackal at all, but rather a close relative of the Gray wolf&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The authors provide a thorough species description through rigorous morphological analysis and assess its distribution in Africa. They have written a blog describing their study, which can be assessed &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/19/rediscovering-african-wolf/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0183-z&quot;&gt;Investigating the ethical issues of using smart-home health technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in using smart-home technologies, that is, technologies that allow a user to control utilities and appliances remotely, is generally on the increase, including the home healthcare industry.  Ethical considerations, such as privacy, user consent, risk of social isolation and equity of access have not, however, been extensively investigated. With this in mind, Birchley &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;interviewed a number of researchers working for multi-center smart-home project and directly involved in the design and implementation of smart-home technologies. The researchers were asked to describe their own experiences of working on the project and their views on ethical considerations pertaining to the use smart-home technologies. Two ethical “themes” emerged, that of privacy and choice. Privacy concerns included possible unauthorized sharing of information and also “physical” privacy- in other words concerns about being watched or monitored. Choice focused on the challenge of balancing the end-user freedom to choose and ethical considerations that could limit these choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0388-9&quot;&gt;The pain experienced by amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported in people living with HIV/AIDS. Recent research suggests that, because many chronic pain conditions are more common in women than men, more women living with HIV/AIDS experience pain. In this study, Parker &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigated chronic pain suffered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_people&quot;&gt;amaXhosa&lt;/a&gt; women living with HIV/AIDS and whether there were associations between pain in this population and various psychosocial factors, including employment, mental health issues and health-related quality of life. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 229 amaXhosa women registered for HIV/AIDS testing at a community health center. All participants were interviewed and asked to fill in a demographic questionnaire. Almost 75% of the women included reported experiencing a significant amount of pain and only two were receiving adequate pain management. Furthermore, pain was more prevalent in those women who were unemployed and had significantly fewer years of schooling; it was also had detrimental effects of mental health and health-related quality of life. The study concludes that pain is a common problem for amaXhosa women with HIV/AIDS and that routine pain assessments could help with the  management of pain and mitigating much of its effects on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-017-0356-1&quot;&gt;Is linoleic acid the key that unlocks the quantum brain?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocchi and colleagues published a review article discussing the role of linoleic acid on the functioning of the brain. In it they describe a mechanistic model that considers subneuronal structures in the brain, such as ion channels, membrane fatty acids and the cytoskeleton, as part of a finely balanced dynamic system that are vital to a healthy brain. Subtle membrane fatty acid changes can disrupt this balance, causing, for example dysregulation of the membrane, cytoskeleton and their interface. Minor changes that lead to significant effects is known to occur in physical systems that are undergoing phase transitions (for example, where a solid changes into a liquid). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model&quot;&gt;Ising model&lt;/a&gt;, for example, undergoes a phase transition from an ordered to disordered state once a particular temperature is reached. Cocchi et al propose that the dynamic system in the brain works in a way similar to the Isling model, with very small changes in linoleic acid concentration being associated with mental health disorders such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-017-1012-8&quot;&gt;New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase (NDM): a worldwide threat to public health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another review article of note this month is from &lt;em&gt;BMC Microbiology &lt;/em&gt;Associate Editor Asad Khan and colleagues, discussing the major worldwide concern about the emergence of carbapenemase producing bacteria, in particular New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1). NDM-1 is a metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme that is structurally dissimilar to other beta-lactamase enzymes. It was first identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from a Swedish patient who had returned from India with a urinary tract infection in 2009. It has become more prevalent in the community and in hospital settings and its markers have been identified in almost all members of the enterobacteriacae family. Khan et al provide a comprehensive view of the structural differences among NDM-1 variants, which are a driving force behind their spread across the globe. Khan also discusses his insights on the emergence of NDM-1 and its effect on bacterial antibiotic resistance in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/28/human-destiny-post-antibiotic-era/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions can be fleeting and superficial, for example imagine the split-second of anger you experience after missing the bus. But other “peak emotional states” are more powerful and they are accompanied by intense physical reactions, such as crying or “the chills”. Often these physical manifestations accompany extreme fear or sadness, but they can also occur when we admire a magnificent sunset or enjoy a beautiful piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384201/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; by Kazuma Mori and Makoto Iwanaga has taken a closer look at the contrasting psychology and physiology underlying the chills and tears many of us experience when we’re profoundly moved by a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23275&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The researchers asked a group of 154 Japanese undergraduate students to estimate how often they experienced music-induced chills or tears. For this purpose, experiencing goose bumps or shivers was defined as chills, while tears were broadly understood as weeping or feeling a lump in the throat. Participants who had reported at least one such peak emotion in response to music were assigned to the chills or tear group, depending on what they had experienced more often. There were 32 students in the chills group, and 34 in the tears group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of musical experience, such as instrument or singing classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers asked each participant to name three songs that had already elicited tears or chills in them, and these were used in the next part of the study. All songs were Japanese pop/rock with lyrics, such as &lt;em&gt;Hello Hello&lt;/em&gt; by Superfly, which elicited chills, and &lt;em&gt;This Love&lt;/em&gt; by Angela Aki, which elicited tears. To control for non-emotional effects of songs (such as increased in tempo or pitch), the experimenters also picked three musically similar control songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant then listened to their six individual songs in a sound-attenuated room while attached to psychophysiological instruments that measured their heart rate, breathing and sweating. Every time they experienced chills or tears, participants were instructed to perform a mouse click. They also gave real-time feedback on how they were feeling using a sliding scale on a computer. After each song, the participants indicated how strongly they had experienced peak emotions (tears or chills), whether these had been positive or negative and how excited or moved they were feeling. Also, they rated how the song was making them feeling in general (happy, sad, calm or fearful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study yielded some very interesting findings. For one, while all the self-picked emotional songs increased physiological arousal at first (faster heart rate, breathing and more sweating), there was a clear differentiation around the onset of peak emotion. As the researchers expected, chills were associated with increasing physiological arousal, whereas tears were associated with slower breathing and physiological calming. Contrary to the tears caused by situations of distress or grief, tears evoked by music in this study were associated with subsequent calming, with could be viewed as a release of tension. These results seem to support the idea that music-induced tears have a cathartic, relieving function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this difference in physiology, both chills and tears were experienced as pleasurable, although there were psychological differences as well. Songs that induced chills were perceived as a mix of happy and sad, while a song that evoked tears was generally considered sad. What is more, tear-inducing songs were generally rated as calmer than chills-inducing songs. Interestingly, the researchers showed that physiological changes were likely not a consequence of the musical characteristics of the songs. Rather, they suggested that physiological arousal and calming occurred as an inherent feature of whether the listener experienced chills or tears, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main limitations of this study was that chills were not assessed in the tears group and vice versa. As previous studies have suggested that chills and tears can co-occur, it remains a possibility that some sad songs triggered both chills and tears. However, this study’s finding that music-induced tears and chills seem to reflect inherently different peak emotions would seem to argue against this possibility. Another potential problem was that emotional songs were familiar to the participants, which opens the doors to possible confounding. For example, songs might trigger emotional memories, which would mean that, rather than the song, a triggered memory was causing the crying or shivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly, findings from Japan are not easily generalised to Western Europe, where emotions likely carry a different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the take-home message? The results give credit to the idea that tears, especially in moments of intense emotion in response to music, are not necessarily bad. Instead, they seem to offer relief by releasing tension, adding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; that has attempted to find out why so many of us seem to enjoy listening to sad music. It will be interesting to see if these new findings can be replicated in a Western sample.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Retraction watch: Peer review in 2030: New report hopes it’s faster, more transparent, and more diverse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, the concept of peer review has changed dramatically – so what does the future hold? That’s a question examined in a new report issued today by BioMed Central and Digital Science, based on discussions held during the SpotOn London conference. (Disclosure: Our co-founder Ivan Oransky spoke there.) We spoke with Elizabeth Moylan, Senior […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: World Asthma Day</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;asthma words&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/asthma-words-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic disease that affects more than 235 million people worldwide. World Asthma Day was organized to address this public health issue, and to increase knowledge of the disease across the globe. Asthma causes one’s airways to become inflamed and produce extra mucus, which can result in various symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. These symptoms may emerge after being triggered by factors that cause more swelling in the airways. Some more common triggers include allergies, smoking, air pollution, dust mites, and physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The severity and cause of symptoms differs from person to person, so it’s crucial that patients are mindful of their particular condition. There is no cure for asthma, but with proper knowledge and treatment, it can be well managed. However, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 383,000 people worldwide died due to asthma complications in 2015. This year on World Asthma Day, we want to highlight some recent research about the disease and its triggers to promote appropriate management. There have been various studies published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; this year that investigate several aspects of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/department-of-medicine/cchsa/joshua-lawson.php#About&quot;&gt;Lawson &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0355-5&quot;&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to better understand how living in urban versus rural areas affects asthma in children. In order to do this, they studied children living in varying population densities, from large urban centers to small, rural towns. They found that while asthma prevalence among children tended to be lower in rural areas, the symptoms were more severe. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it could be due to certain environmental triggers or differences in disease management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asthma symptoms in the workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conditions encountered in the workplace can also trigger asthma symptoms. These are referred to as occupational exposures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0306-1&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; sought to explore the association between certain occupational exposures and asthma exacerbation. Overall, Kim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; found that the following conditions were associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbation: exposure to gas, smoke, and dust, cold temperatures, strenuous activity, and damp and moldy environments. Dampness and mold, as well as strenuous activity, specifically were associated with severe asthma exacerbation. It is important for asthmatic patients to be aware of the risks these conditions pose, and should avoid them whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep disorders and asthma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, have also been shown to negatively affect asthma symptoms. These conditions reduce airflow to the lungs which increases acid reflux and inflammation, which may ultimately worsen asthma symptoms. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-016-0313-2&quot;&gt;recent research article&lt;/a&gt;, Han &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; studied the effects of sleeping disorders on asthma symptoms in South Korea. Sleep disorders have become increasingly common in South Korea, and asthma here is relatively not well managed. The study found that sleep disorders in patients previously diagnosed with asthma tend to worsen symptoms and increase risk of mortality. This reveals the importance of finding a proper course of treatment and being aware of the added risks of sleeping disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8921&quot; style=&quot;width: 950px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Asthma deaths in 2012&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8921 size-full&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Asthma-map.png&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Asthma deaths in 2012&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Data from World Health Organization Estimated Deaths 2012 Vector map from BlankMap-World6, compact.svg by Canuckguy et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While asthma is a major public health issue — and the most common noncommunicable disease among children — it can be controlled to live a good quality of life. One major concern is that it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. This is of particular concern in low and lower-middle income nations, where asthma-related death rates are the highest. By raising awareness on World Asthma Day, people around the world hope to address this issue to ensure asthmatic patients can properly identify and treat their symptoms. This way we can lessen the burden on not only patients, but also those close to them. If you are interested in learning  more about this disease, we encourage you to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;website for more related papers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a Gasdermin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22393</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5KXDCviNES0/nature22393</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Pyroptosis, activated by the canonical caspase-1 inflammasomes or caspase-4/5/11 by cytosolic LPS, is critical for immunity1,2,3. The caspases cleave Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in the middle linker to release autoinhibition on its Gasdermin-N domain that executes pyroptosis via the pore-forming activity4,5,6,7,8,9. GSDMD belongs to a Gasdermin family sharing the pore-forming domain4,6,10. The function and mechanism of activation for other Gasdermins are unknown. Here we show that GSDME, originally identified as DFNA5 (Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 5)11, could switch TNFα or chemotherapy drugs-induced and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis to pyroptosis. GSDME was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 in the linker, generating a GSDME-N fragment that perforated membranes for pyroptosis induction. Following chemotherapy drugs treatment, caspase-3 cleavage of GSDME determined pyroptosis in certain GSDME-expressing cancer cells. GSDME was silenced in most cancer cells but expressed in many normal tissues. Human primary cells exhibited GSDME-dependent pyroptosis upon caspase-3 activation by chemotherapy drugs. Gsdme-/- mice were protected from chemotherapy drugs-induced various tissue damages and weight loss. These findings bring an unexpected concept that caspase-3 activation can trigger necrosis through cleaving GSDME and offer new insights into cancer chemotherapy.
