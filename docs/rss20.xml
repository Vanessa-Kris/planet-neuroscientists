&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the UK, the clocks went back last weekend and we’re now faced with dark, gloomy evenings. &lt;/strong&gt;But around the world, many countries have decided that the time has come to abolish clock changes. And there are good reasons for doing so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/governments-worldwide-consider-ditching-daylight-saving-time/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;Beth Malow tells Diana Kwon at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: changing the clocks throws our circadian rhythms out, which can affect our sleep and stress response&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40684&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who generally do more “media multitasking” — using social media while watching TV, for instance — showed more lapses of attention during a recall task in a recent study,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/science/media-multitasking-memory-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;reports Kat Eschner&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Popular Science. &lt;/em&gt;The results suggest that media multitasking could be related to poorer concentration and memory — but as the story notes, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the direction of causality, as well as the suitability of the measures used in this kind of work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a relatively rare subtype of dementia called “autoimmune dementia”, caused by antibodies binding to brain tissue. &lt;/strong&gt;It may often be misdiagnosed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/25/the-dementia-that-can-be-cured&quot;&gt;writes David Cox at &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but the good news is that, once identified, it is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study of UK MPs and councillors reveals the extent to which politicians have to engage in “emotional labour”,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/burn-out-the-emotional-toll-of-being-a-politician-revealed-146323&quot;&gt;writes researcher James Weinberg&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, the majority of those surveyed said that they frequently had to be artificially friendly or act nice to others, no matter how they were treated themselves. Consistent with findings from other professions, women seemed to end up taking on more of this emotional labour than men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new tool for studying the human brain has recently been added to the neuroscientist’s toolbox: brain organoids, rudimentary brain-like structures grown in the lab from stem cells&lt;/strong&gt;. But the use of these “mini-brains” also brings up tricky ethical issues. At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02986-y&quot;&gt;Sara Reardon asks&lt;/a&gt; at what point a collection of brain cells becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, optogenetics, in which neurons can be activated using light, continues to produce scientific insights — in rodents, at least. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s been much more challenging to use the technique in primate studies, however, which are an important step towards developing optogenetics-based therapies for humans. But researchers hope a new open data initiative will help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/controlling-monkey-brains-light-could-get-easier-thanks-open-data-project&quot;&gt;writes Kelly Servick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last interesting neuroscience study from this week: scientists have created a brain-computer interface by attaching electrodes onto a stent, which they then threaded into a blood vessel in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;The technology enabled patients with paralysis to click a cursor on a computer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-way-to-plug-a-human-brain-into-a-computer-via-veins/&quot;&gt;reports Adam Rogers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired,&lt;/em&gt; allowing them to text and shop online.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: How frigid lizards falling from trees revealed the reptiles’ growing cold tolerance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092696</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-lizards-falling-trees-cold-tolerance-climate-change</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After the coldest night in south Florida in a decade, lizards were dropping out of palm trees, landing legs up. The scientists who raced to investigate the fallen reptiles have now found that, despite such graceless falls, some of these tropical, cold-blooded creatures are actually more resilient to cold than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding sheds light on how some species might respond to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fingerprints-climate-change-increasingly-appear-extreme-weather&quot;&gt;extreme weather events caused by human-caused climate change&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/10/19&lt;/em&gt;). Although climate change is expected to include gradual warming globally, scientists think that extreme events such as heat waves, cold snaps, droughts and torrential downpours could also grow in number and strength over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea for the new study was born after evolutionary ecologist James Stroud received a photo of a roughly 60-centimeter-long iguana prone on its back on a sidewalk from a friend in Key Biscayne, an island town south of Miami. The previous night, temperatures dropped to just under 4.4° Celsius (40° Fahrenheit).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When air temperatures drop below a critical limit, lizards lose the ability to move,” says Stroud, of Washington University in St. Louis. Lizards that sleep in trees “may lose their grip.” Stunned lizards on the ground are likely easy prey for predators, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the cold snap could be used to study how future instances of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire&quot;&gt;extreme weather&lt;/a&gt; might affect such animals in the wild, Stroud and colleagues rushed to collect live specimens of as many different kinds of lizards as they could in the Miami area (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/27/20&lt;/em&gt;). The researchers then tested how well the six reptile species they captured tolerated cold by sticking thermometers on the animals, placing them in a large cooler of ice and observing how cold they got before becoming too stunned to right themselves after getting flipped on their backs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stroud and colleagues had previously run similar tests on these lizard species as part of research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13511&quot;&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;. That work in 2016 suggested that the reptiles might not easily withstand cold snaps like the recent one — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuataras-rare-reptiles-genes-longevity-cool-weather&quot;&gt;cold tolerances&lt;/a&gt; ranged from as low as about 7.7° C for the Puerto Rican crested anole (&lt;em&gt;Anolis cristatellus&lt;/em&gt;) to roughly 11.1° C for the brown basilisk (&lt;em&gt;Basiliscus vittatus&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;brown basilisk lizard&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092698&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102720_cc_lizards_inline1_rev.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092698&quot;&gt;Some tropical, cold-blooded lizards, such as this brown basilisk (&lt;em&gt;Basiliscus vittatus&lt;/em&gt;), are more resilient to cold than previously thought, a new study finds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092698&quot;&gt;John Sullivan/iNaturalist (CC BY-NC 4.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study, however, revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0625&quot;&gt;the reptiles now could withstand temperatures roughly 1 to 4 degrees&lt;/a&gt; C colder. Oddly, the lizards, on average, could all endure cold down to the same lowest temperature, about 5.5° C, the researchers report in the October &lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt;. Given the great variation in size, ecology and physiology between these species, “this was a really unexpected result,” and one that the researchers don’t have an explanation for, Stroud says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natural selection may be behind the change, meaning that abnormally cold temperatures are killing off those individuals that could not survive and leaving behind those that happen to be better able to tolerate cold. Alternatively, the reptiles’ bodies could have changed in some way to acclimate to the colder temperatures. Stroud hopes in the future to measure the cold tolerance of lizards immediately before a forecasted cold snap and then examine the same reptiles immediately afterward to look for signs of acclimation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long thought that tropical species, which have typically evolved in thermally stable environments, might prove especially vulnerable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/rising-temperatures-may-cause-problems-cold-blooded-critters&quot;&gt;major shifts in temperature&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/20/15&lt;/em&gt;). This new study reveals a way in which species can either rapidly evolve or acclimate, which “may provide ecosystems with some resilience to extreme climate events,” says Alex Pigot, an ecologist at University College London who did not take part in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One remaining question “is whether this resilience also applies to extreme heating events,” Pigot adds. “Previous evidence has suggested that species’ upper thermal limits may be less flexible than their lower thermal limits.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How two immune system chemicals may trigger COVID-19’s deadly cytokine storms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3093139</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-chemicals-deadly-cytokine-storm</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the coronavirus kills is a mystery. But part of the problem may be a partnership between just two immune system chemicals that triggers deadly organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In mice, a combination of immune chemicals called TNF alpha and gamma interferon trips a domino chain of biochemical reactions that ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.361048v1&quot;&gt;leads to three types of cell death&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report October 29 at bioRxiv.org. That wave of cell death further feeds an escalation of immune chemicals, known as a cytokine storm, that leads to more cell death and causes tissue and organ damage and failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the same process happens in people with severe COVID-19, the research points to several existing drugs that might help calm the cytokine storm and prevent severe disease or aid recovery. The preliminary results, however, have not yet been reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study after study has found that people with severe COVID-19 have elevated levels of inflammation-stimulating chemicals called cytokines in their blood compared with healthy people, says immunologist Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. But the mechanism by which cytokines can lead to organ failure and death isn’t known.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kanneganti and colleagues selected eight of the most commonly elevated cytokines in severely ill COVID-19 patients to see how the cytokines affect cells growing in lab dishes. Alone, none of cytokines caused harm to infection-fighting macrophage cells. But when the researchers treated macrophages with a cocktail of all eight cytokines, “we were seeing dramatic cell death, unbelievable, through the roof,” Kanneganti says. The team then tried various combinations of cytokines and discovered that only the pairing of TNF alpha and gamma interferon was deadly to macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s surprising, says Mohamed Lamkanfi, an immunologist at Ghent University in Belgium who was not involved in the study. Those cytokines have been studied for decades and weren’t previously implicated in killing cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This deadly duo doesn’t just kill cells. “When we injected the combination of TNF and interferon gamma, mice are dead like flies. Within 10 hours they just drop dead,” Kanneganti says. And those mice had symptoms similar to those seen in people with severe COVID-19, such as low numbers of infection-fighting T cells and signs of liver and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, Kanneganti and her colleagues deciphered how the two cytokines kill cells and mice. In a series of experiments, the researchers found that the combo triggers three kinds of cell death: apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis is a quiet kind of programmed cell death that happens often, even in healthy people. It’s necessary for proper development and health, including avoiding cancer. Cells infected with a virus will often set off this self-destruct mechanism. Their deaths and removal from the body may help shield other cells from becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis and necroptosis are messier, causing cells to spill their guts and release cytokines and debris that can trigger more inflammation. Researchers knew that these gorier deaths are involved in some inflammatory conditions, but apoptosis wasn’t previously known to rile up the immune system, Kanneganti says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activating all three types of cell death together — an inflammation-producing process Kanneganti calls PANoptosis — leads to an ever-escalating cytokine storm, “like a hurricane,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have thought that those three varieties of cell death were triggered by different biochemical switches. But Kanneganti’s group found that all three types of death can result from a single chain reaction, or pathway. At the trailhead of the biochemical pathway sit proteins known as STAT1 and JAK. Inappropriate chemical actions by both have been implicated in some types of cancer, and inhibitors of these proteins are being tested in cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One inhibitor of JAK, a drug called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain&quot;&gt;baricitinib,&lt;/a&gt; is already being tested against the coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). Preliminary evidence suggests that when given to hospitalized patients along with the antiviral drug remdesivir, baricitinib can&lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/baricitinib-combination-remdesivir-reduces-time-recovery&quot;&gt; shorten hospital stays&lt;/a&gt; even more than remdesivir alone has been shown to do.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that blocking TNF alpha and gamma interferon protected mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — from dying. Mice with other inflammatory conditions were also protected from dying when both cytokines were blocked, and to a lesser extent when only one was blocked. Those findings suggest that both cytokines must be blocked to have an effect, Lamkanfi says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drugs and antibodies that block the two immune chemicals exist and are used to treat some autoimmune diseases. For instance, TNF alpha inhibitors are used to treat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kanneganti’s data are convincing that the two cytokines may be involved in what’s going wrong in severely ill COVID-19 patients, says Craig Coopersmith, a sepsis researcher and director of the Emory Critical Care Center in Atlanta. “It’s mechanistically fascinating and gives multiple potential [drug] targets that are worth exploring,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he’s skeptical that blocking the two cytokines will be as effective in people as it was in mice. “I have cured mouse sepsis 15 times, and I know my colleagues have cured mouse COVID,” he says. But “most of the time when you do the trials in people, they turn out to be negative.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And just because a drug could plausibly work doesn’t mean it will, of course. For instance, an antibody drug called tocilizumab, which blocks another cytokine called IL-6, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-arthritis-drug-tocilizumab-not-promising&quot;&gt;did not show a benefit&lt;/a&gt; for treating COVID-19 in recent clinical trials (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/23/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In people, the triad of cell death triggered by TNF alpha and gamma interferon isn’t necessarily the only thing killing COVID-19 patients, Coopersmith emphasizes. Blood clotting and cardiovascular issues and lung damage from mechanical ventilation are also big problems. Nevertheless, the new “mechanistically phenomenal study” gives researchers a good place to start teasing out what goes wrong in people with severe COVID-19, he says, and learning how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the dark days of April, the death rate was over 20%. Although this has declined dramatically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to 3%&lt;/a&gt;), it’s utterly reckless to minimize the risks of coronavirus and flaunt every mitigation strategy endorsed by infectious disease specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/k3lV4BzOVZg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He's like an evil Oprah&lt;/a&gt;.

Awareness of death or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_salience&quot;&gt;mortality salience&lt;/a&gt; —  pondering the inevitability of your own death, a time when you will no longer exist — triggers anxiety, according the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260115000052&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Terror Management Theory&lt;/a&gt; (TMT). In response to this threat, humans react in ways to boost their self-esteem and reinforce their own values (and punish outsiders). These cognitive processes are conceptualized as nebulous “defenses”  [&lt;i&gt;nebulous to me, at least&lt;/i&gt;] that are deployed to minimize terror. Notably, however, experimental manipulation of mortality salience did &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; affect “worldview defense” in the large-scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cos.io/blog/many-labs-4-failure-replicate-mortality-salience-effect-and-without-original-author-involvement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Many Labs 4&lt;/a&gt; replication project, which throws cold water on this aspect of TMT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predictive Coding and Perceived Risk of COVID-19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative view of how we disassociate ourselves from death awareness is provided by predictive coding theory. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23663408/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science (Clark 2013)&quot;&gt;influential framework&lt;/a&gt; hypothesizes that the brain is constantly generating and updating its models of the world based on top-down “biases” and bottom-up sensory input (Clark, 2013):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23663408/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brains ... are essentially prediction machines&lt;/a&gt;. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction errors are minimized by perceptual inference (updating predictions to better match the input) or active inference (sampling the input in a biased fashion to better ﬁt the predictions). A recent paper considered this framework with regard to beliefs generated during the pandemic, and how they're related to health precautions adopted by individuals to mitigate spread of the virus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242918/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bottemanne et al, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). This paper was conceptual (not computational), and it was written in French (meaning I had to read it using Google translate). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, pandemics are massive sources of uncertainty. There was a delay in the perception of risk, followed by unrealistic optimism (“certainly &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; do not &lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;run the risk of becoming infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;”) despite the growing accumulation of evidence to the contrary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The reduced perception of risk leads people to flaunt precautionary mandates, even in France (which is currently showing a greater spike in cases than the US).

	<title>Science News: These human nerve cell tendrils turned to glass nearly 2,000 years ago</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092622</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-vesuvius-eruption-human-nerve-cell-tendrils-glass</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,000 years ago, a cloud of scorching ash from Mount Vesuvius buried a young man as he lay on a wooden bed. That burning ash quickly cooled, turning some of his brain to glass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This confluence of events in A.D. 79 in the town of Herculaneum, which lay at the western base of the volcano, preserved the usually delicate neural tissue in a durable, glassy form. New scrutiny of this tissue has revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240017&quot;&gt;signs of nerve cells&lt;/a&gt; with elaborate tendrils for sending and receiving messages, scientists report October 6 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That the young man once possessed these nerve cells, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experiment-live-human-brain-helps-scientists-map-nerve-cells&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt;, is no surprise; human brains are packed with roughly 86 billion neurons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/7/19&lt;/em&gt;). But samples from ancient brains are sparse. Those that do exist have become a soaplike substance or mummified, says Pier Paolo Petrone, a biologist and forensic anthropologist at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy. But while studying the Herculaneum site, Petrone noticed something dark and shiny inside this man’s skull. He realized that those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc1909867&quot;&gt;glassy, black fragments&lt;/a&gt; “had to be the remains of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ancient brain tissue&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092624&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102320_LS_old-neuron_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092624&quot;&gt;This dark, shiny object is ancient brain tissue from a Mount Vesuvius victim. The brain turned to glass as it was heated, liquefied and cooled, a process called vitrification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092624&quot;&gt;P. Petrone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Petrone and colleagues used scanning electron microscopy to study glassy remains from both the man’s brain and spinal cord. The researchers saw tubular structures as well as cell bodies that were the right sizes and shapes to be neurons. In further analyses, the team found layers of tissue wrapped around tendrils in the brain tissue. This layering appears to be myelin, a fatty substance that speeds signals along nerve fibers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The preserved tissue was “something really astonishing and incredible,” Petrone says, because the conversion of objects to glass, a process called vitrification, is relatively rare in nature. “This is the first ever discovery of ancient human brain remains vitrified by hot ash during a volcanic eruption.” &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: The first Denisovan DNA outside Siberia unveils a long stint on the roof of the world</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092692</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-denisovan-dna-outside-siberia-found-tibetan-plateau-cave</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mysterious, now-extinct members of the human lineage called Denisovans lived at the roof of the world for possibly 100,000 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denisovan mitochondrial DNA extracted from sediment layers in Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau indicates that these humanlike folk inhabited the high-altitude site roughly 100,000 years ago and again around 60,000 years ago, say geoarchaeologist Dongju Zhang of Lanzhou University, China, and her colleagues. These are the first examples of Denisovan DNA found outside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;Siberia’s Denisova Cave&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/16/1&lt;/em&gt;9).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cave sediment possibly dating from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago also yielded Denisovan mitochondrial DNA, the scientists report in the Oct. 30 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. If further research confirms that age estimate, it raises the likelihood that &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6320&quot;&gt;Denisovans survived on the Tibetan Plateau&lt;/a&gt; long enough to encounter the first humans to reach those heights as early as 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that case, ancient humans new to the region’s thin air may have acquired advantageous genetic traits for that environment by mating with resident Denisovans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tibetans-live-high-life-thanks-extinct-human-relatives&quot;&gt;Present-day Tibetans carry a Denisovan gene variant&lt;/a&gt; that aids high-altitude survival (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/2/14&lt;/em&gt;), although it’s not clear if interbreeding occurred on the Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Zhang’s group previously identified a lower jaw fossil from Baishiya Karst Cave as having come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jawbone-shows-denisovans-lived-tibetan-plateau-long-humans&quot;&gt;a Denisovan that lived at least 160,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/1/19&lt;/em&gt;). That analysis focused on the jaw’s protein structure, not DNA, leaving questions about the find’s evolutionary identity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Denisovan mitochondrial DNA at Baishiya Karst Cave — found in sediment layers that also contained stone tools and pieces of animal bones — displayed close links to mitochondrial Denisovan DNA at Denisova Cave, located about 2,800 kilometers northwest of the Tibetan Plateau site. Overall, the new findings suggest “that Denisovan populations were widespread in eastern Eurasia and had adapted to the Tibetan Plateau for a long time,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sharp pieces of stone from Baishiya Karst Cave&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092694&quot; height=&quot;369&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102920_BB_denisovans_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092694&quot;&gt;Intentionally sharpened pieces of stone (in each pair, both sides of tool shown) found at Baishiya Karst Cave may have been made by Denisovans, now-extinct evolutionary cousins of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092694&quot;&gt;Yuanyuan Han, D. Zhang, Lanzhou Univ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA, typically inherited from the mother, provides a narrower view of a population’s evolutionary past than nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents. Zhang’s group has yet to find Denisovan nuclear DNA in Baishiya Karst Cave sediment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denisovan genetic evidence remains sparse, says paleogeneticist Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. But evidence of Denisovan DNA that has been inherited by people today suggests that Denisovans ranged from the frigid Tibetan Plateau to tropical Southeast Asia, says Lalueza-Fox, who did not participate in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given their wide Asian distribution, Denisovan populations developed a range of genetic traits and cultural behaviors, he suspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; supports that idea. Nuclear DNA extracted from fossils of two ancient Asian &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; — one dating to around 34,000 years ago in Mongolia and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-human-dna-suggests-minimal-interbreeding&quot;&gt;the other to roughly 40,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in China (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/21/13&lt;/em&gt;) — includes segments &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abc1166&quot;&gt;inherited from a specific line of Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, says a team led by paleogeneticist Diyendo Massilani of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. Those genetic segments are found in present-day mainland Asians but are distinct from Denisovan DNA that modern Papuans and Aboriginal Australians apparently inherited from ancestors who interbred with another Denisovan population, the scientists report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS Update</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18491</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over four years ago we launched PLOS Channels to highlight research and news relevant to our research communities. Eventually, the portfolio grew to include 13 Channels in topics from stem cells to tuberculosis to cholera (see the full list below). New content was added to Channels by expert Channel Editors, who selected articles to include in a journal- and publisher-agnostic manner. Channels were initially conceived as a meaningful space to serve a variety of communities beyond typical journal boundaries and challenge the assessment of impact and importance of research.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we are announcing that we have made the difficult decision to stop updating the Channels. Despite positive feedback from some authors and their institutions, we have not seen the usage from the community that would allow us to achieve our goals. Moreover, we were not able to scale the program to meet everyone’s needs, and we suspect that post-publication curation of content may be best done by a neutral third party, rather than an organisation like PLOS, which publishes some of the content included in the Channels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content in all Channels will be archived and will remain available online. The following two Channels will migrate to PLOS Curated Collections, where they will continue to be updated with relevant research from PLOS to connect people to content and inspire collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–      &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot;&gt;  Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research&lt;/a&gt;: to maintain our commitment to the Veteran’s Administration&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–      &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;  Disease Forecasting &amp;amp; Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;: because the current pandemic demonstrates the essential nature of this content, and its curation. This Channel will be renamed to Infectious Disease Epidemiology to ensure that all relevant content on this important topic is included.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS would not exist without the people who believe in our mission and values, and who help us with  projects like Channels. We rely on scientists like our Channel Editors to keep pushing us on our collective journey to make science more open, accessible and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On behalf of everyone at PLOS, we want to thank all our Channel Editors and Administrators (past &amp;amp; present) for their tireless work and dedication and all of the loyal subscribers who have followed PLOS Channels over the years. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have truly enriched our organization and science as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Men Who Sleep Less Are Seen As More Masculine: A Stereotype With Potentially Damaging Consequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40666</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/29/men-who-sleep-less-are-seen-as-more-masculine-a-stereotype-with-potentially-damaging-consequences/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some curious cultural ideas around sleep, namely that there’s something virtuous or impressive about not getting very much of it. “Burnout” is often shorthand for success: if you’re successful it follows that you’re also pretty busy, in which case you’re less likely to get enough sleep. Margaret Thatcher famously boasted that she only needed to sleep four hours a night, as has Donald Trump — though whether that bolsters or damages the prestige associated with sleepless nights probably depends on your politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There may also be links between sleep and perceptions of masculinity, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711758&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association for Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt; suggests. In a number of studies, Nathan B. Warren and Troy H. Campbell from the University of Oregon found that not only do we associate sleep deprivation with masculinity, but that men who sleep less actually experience more favourable social judgements than their better-rested counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40666&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 144 participants were asked to imagine a man shopping for a bed; when approached by a salesperson, the man is asked how much he sleeps. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: in one, the man answers that he sleeps a lot, while in the other he states that he sleeps very little. After hearing the man’s answer, participants rated how masculine they felt he was — and when participants heard that he had lots of sleep, masculinity ratings were significantly lower than in the little sleep condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, participants were asked to describe either a masculine or non-masculine man’s habits and behaviours: what he would like to do for fun, for example, as well as how much sleep he would get on average. As in the first study, there was a link: those in the masculine condition described their character sleeping for 33 minutes less than the non-masculine character.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then explored &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; men who sleep less are seen as less masculine. They asked 207 participants to describe a man who either gets “lots of sleep” or “little sleep”, rating his character on seven measures of agency (e.g. “he is individualistic” or “he is assertive”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, participants rated men who sleep a lot as significantly less masculine than those who sleep a little. But participants’ perceptions of agency seemed to be key to this link: characters who sleep a lot were described as having less agency than those who sleep a little, and this in turn led people to rate those characters as less masculine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A later study looked at social judgements: are men who sleep more judged more harshly than those who sleep less? Participants were asked how American society would judge various people (e.g. “athletes” and “adult males”) if they either slept  “a lot” or ”very little”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As predicted, men who sleep a lot were evaluated more negatively than those who sleep a little, while there was no difference for women. Interestingly, judgements across other categories were uneven — athletes were positively evaluated when they slept a lot, whilst lawyers were more favourably looked upon when they slept a little. A subsequent study again showed that perceptions of agency and masculinity were important when making these social judgments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team found that even self-evaluations were influenced by stereotypes about sleep and masculinity. Men who imagined telling another person that they slept more than average felt significantly less masculine than those who imagined saying they slept less than average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key factor in understanding why there is such a strong link between sleep and perceived masculinity, the team argues, is &lt;em&gt;agency.&lt;/em&gt; Many facets of agency are considered to be stereotypically masculine — assertiveness, individualism, orientation towards goals — compared to the more “feminine” traits of empathy or affection. If you’re goal-oriented and assertive, you’re likely to be someone who strives to use their time efficiently — which is where the perceived link between success, sleep and masculinity might come into play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t particularly interested in abiding by gender stereotypes or reject them altogether, the results probably don’t make much difference. But if men are sleeping less because of worries around masculinity, they could face some seriously negative consequences:  physical or mental health issues have often been linked to poor sleep. Challenging stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, as in so many other areas, may prove beneficial when it comes to persuading men it’s alright to have a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711758&quot;&gt;The Sleep-Deprived Masculinity Stereotype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Ogre-faced spiders catch insects out of the air using sound instead of sight</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092681</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ogre-faced-spider-hearing-catch-insects-prey-air-sound-sight</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some spiders wait for prey to come and tickle their web. But the ogre-faced spider (&lt;em&gt;Deinopis spinosa&lt;/em&gt;) uses its sense of hearing to take its web to the prey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hanging upside down, the spider weaves a rectangular web between its legs. When an insect flies behind the dangling arachnid, the spider swings backward, casting the web toward the prey. This behind-the-back hunting technique is one clue that the spiders can hear an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31418-4?utm_source=EA&quot;&gt;unexpectedly wide range of sounds&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online October 29 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “A couple years ago, we didn’t really have a great idea that spiders could hear,” says Jay Stafstrom, a sensory ecologist at Cornell University. But now, he and his colleagues have looked at several spider species, and most can hear using specialized organs on their legs, he says. That includes jumping spiders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/be-careful-what-you-say-around-jumping-spiders&quot;&gt;which respond to low frequencies&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/15/16&lt;/em&gt;). Surprisingly, ogre-faced spiders can also hear fairly high frequencies, Stafstrom says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stafstrom and colleagues inserted microelectrodes into the brains of 13 ogre-faced spiders, and then played tones of varying frequencies from a speaker while monitoring the spiders’ auditory nerve cell activity. Spikes of activity revealed that the spiders can sense airborne sounds between 100 and 10,000 hertz, though not at every frequency, the team found. (Humans generally hear between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Nerve cells in amputated spider legs — where the slit sensilla, the organ that responds to sound vibrations, is located — also responded to the wide range of frequencies. This finding confirms that the spiders hear with their legs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team wondered how the spiders would respond to hearing sounds of varying frequencies in the wild. So the scientists took their speaker to part of the spiders’ natural range in Gainesville, Fla., and found 25 of the dangling hunters waiting for prey in the dark. Of those, 13 reacted to frequencies of 150, 400 or 750 Hz. And each reacted in the same way — with a blind, backward strike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They can obviously catch things out of the air just using sound,” Stafstrom says. And because the spiders strike only at low frequencies, they’re probably using the lower end of their hearing to listen for prey and hunt. As for the upper frequency range, “they don’t seem to be using it in a foraging context,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;An ogre-faced spider dangles from its web as it waits for prey in the dark. When it hears prey fly behind its back, the spider swings backward and, like a fisher throwing a net, it flicks a rectangular web at its would-be meal.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the fact that the spiders can detect higher frequencies means that these sounds are probably important to them, says Jayne Yack, a neuroethologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who wasn’t involved in the research. Spiders may be using their sense of hearing for a range of things, including eavesdropping on predators, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, those higher frequencies fall in the same range of sounds that predators, including birds, make as they move around or call, so it makes sense for spiders to listen for those frequencies, says Damian Elias, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn’t involved in the study. The tricky thing, though, is detecting a behavioral response to those higher sounds. Unlike web slinging, the reaction to hearing a predator may simply be to stay put and hide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How octopuses ‘taste’ things by touching</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092678</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Octopus arms have minds of their own. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight supple yet powerful limbs can explore the seafloor in search of prey, snatching crabs from hiding spots without direction from the octopus’ brain. But how each arm can tell what it’s grasping has remained a mystery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have identified specialized cells not seen in other animals that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31149-1?utm_source=EA&quot;&gt;allow octopuses to “taste” with their arms&lt;/a&gt;. Embedded in the suckers, these cells enable the arms to do double duty of touch and taste by detecting chemicals produced by many aquatic creatures. This may help an arm quickly distinguish food from rocks or poisonous prey, Harvard University molecular biologist Nicholas Bellono and his colleagues report online October 29 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings provide another clue about the unique evolutionary path octopuses have taken toward intelligence. Instead of being concentrated in the brain, two-thirds of the nerve cells in an octopus are distributed among the arms, allowing the flexible appendages to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-move-uncoordinated-arms&quot;&gt;operate semi-independently&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/16/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There was a huge gap in knowledge of how octopus [arms] actually collect information about their environment,” says Tamar Gutnick, a neurobiologist who studies octopuses at Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was not involved in the study. “We’ve known that [octopuses] taste by touch, but knowing it and understanding how it’s actually working is a very different thing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working out the specifics of how arms sense and process information is crucial for understanding octopus intelligence, she says. “It’s really exciting to see someone taking a comprehensive look at the cell types involved,” and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bellono and his colleagues weren’t sure what they would find when they took a close look at the arms of a California two-spot octopus (&lt;em&gt;Octopus bimaculoides&lt;/em&gt;). Detailed imaging identified what appeared to be sensory cells, some with fine branched endings, at the surface of suckers. The researchers isolated the cells and tested their response to a variety of stimuli, such as fish extract and pressure. One class of cells turned out to be similar to those that detect touch in a variety of animals. But the cells that responded to fish extract contained receptors, proteins that detect specific stimuli, unlike any seen in other animals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To study how these “chemotactile” receptors work, the researchers inserted them into human and frog cells in the lab using genetic tools and then exposed them to a variety of chemical compounds an octopus might normally encounter. Only one class of molecules, insoluble terpenoids, elicited a response from the cells. Terpenoids, natural compounds found in the bodies of many marine creatures, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2014.00092/full&quot;&gt;thought to be used in defense by some animals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially the finding struck Bellono as somewhat odd, since these compounds don’t dissolve well. “For aquatic sensation, we usually think of molecules that diffuse well through water,” he says, similar to how humans smell compounds that diffuse through air. But then Bellono realized that this might make sense given how octopuses move through the world “by touching everything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specialized terpenoid detectors might cue an octopus to quickly grasp something it touches lest it swim away, or withdraw and keep searching. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This played out in the lab, where octopuses in tanks explored normal surfaces without terpenoids with broad, sweeping arm movements. But once an arm touched a surface infused with different terpenoids it stopped, either quickly tapping the spot and moving on, or immediately withdrawing and avoiding that part of the tank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s not clear just what these behaviors mean, they confirm that octopuses do use these receptors to sense chemicals by touch. “We equate it to taste by touch just so that we can sort of understand what it might mean to the octopus, but it’s very different than our taste,” Bellono says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His lab is already working on identifying other compounds detected by these sensors, as well as investigating how the receptors might be tuned to respond to different sorts of stimuli depending on the context, such as how hungry the octopus is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: LIGO and Virgo’s gravitational wave tally more than quadrupled in six months</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092670</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-gravitational-wave-quadruple-black-hole</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earth is awash in gravitational waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over a six-month period, scientists captured a bounty of 39 sets of gravitational waves. The waves, which stretch and squeeze the fabric of spacetime, were caused by violent events such as the melding of two black holes into one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The haul was reported by scientists with the LIGO and Virgo experiments in several studies posted October 28 on a collaboration website and at arXiv.org. The addition &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.ligo.org/P2000061/public&quot;&gt;brings the tally of known gravitational wave events to 50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bevy of data, which includes sightings from April to October 2019, suggests that scientists’ gravitational wave–spotting skills have leveled up. Before this round of searching, only 11 events had been detected in the years since the effort began in 2015. Improvements to the detectors — two that make up the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, in the United States, and another, Virgo, in Italy — have dramatically boosted the rate of gravitational wave sightings.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While colliding black holes produced most of the ripples, a few collisions seem to have involved neutron stars, ultradense nuggets of matter left behind when stars explode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the events added to the gravitational wave register had been previously reported individually, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;biggest black hole collision&lt;/a&gt; spotted so far (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/2/20&lt;/em&gt;) and a collision between a black hole and an object that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object&quot;&gt;couldn’t be identified&lt;/a&gt; as either a neutron star or black hole (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/23/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Gravitational waves are produced when two massive objects, such as black holes, spiral around one another and merge. These visualizations, which are based on computer simulations, show these merging objects for 38 of the 50 known gravitational wave events.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, some of the coalescing black holes seem to be very large and spinning rapidly, says astrophysicist Richard O’Shaughnessy of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, a member of the LIGO collaboration. That’s something “really compelling in the data now that we hadn’t seen before,” he says. Such information &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000077/public/&quot;&gt;might help reveal the processes&lt;/a&gt; by which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-events-needed-pin-down-gravitational-waves-backstory&quot;&gt;black holes get partnered up&lt;/a&gt; before they collide (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/19/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also used the smorgasbord of smashups to further check Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, which predicts the existence of gravitational waves. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000091/public&quot;&gt;tested with the new data&lt;/a&gt; — surprise, surprise — Einstein came up a winner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Doubts over a ‘possible sign of life’ on Venus show how science works</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092627</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was one of those “big, if true” stories. In September, scientists reported that Venus’ atmosphere seems to be laced with phosphine, a possible sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now there’s increasing emphasis on the “if.” As scientists take fresh looks at the data behind the Venus announcement, and add other datasets to the mix, the original claim of inexplicable amounts of phosphine is being called into doubt. And that’s a good thing, many scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s exactly how science should work,” says planetary scientist Paul Byrne of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who studies Venus but was not involved in any of the phosphine papers. “It’s too early to say one way or the other what this detection means for Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at efforts to get from “if” to “true:”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;The big claim&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On September 14, astronomer Jane Greaves of Cardiff University in Wales and colleagues reported that they had seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life&quot;&gt;signs of phosphine in Venus’ clouds&lt;/a&gt; using two different telescopes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/14/20&lt;/em&gt;). The phosphine seemed to be too abundant to exist without some kind of source replenishing it. That source could be strange microbes living in the clouds, or some weird unknown Venusian chemistry, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greaves and colleagues first spotted phosphine with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii and followed up with the powerful ALMA telescope array in Chile. But those ALMA data, and particularly the way they were handled, are now being called into question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ALMA&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092629&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102720_lg_venus_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092629&quot;&gt;Scientists used ALMA, a powerful radio telescope array in Chile, to confirm the detection of Venus’ phosphine. Now those data are being questioned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092629&quot;&gt;© ALMA (ESO, NAOJ, NRAO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Reading the data: Real molecules or random wiggles?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key Venus observations were spectra, or plots of the light coming from the planet in a range of wavelengths. Different molecules block or absorb light at specific wavelengths, so searching for dips in a spectrum can reveal the chemicals in a planet’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phosphine showed up as a dip in Venus’ spectrum at about 1.12 millimeters, a wavelength of light that the molecule was thought to be absorbing. If Venus’ spectrum could be drawn as a straight line across all wavelengths of light, phosphine would make a deep valley at that wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But real data are never that easy to read. In real life, other sources — from Earth’s atmosphere to the inner workings of the telescope itself — introduce wiggles, or “noise,” into that nice straight line. The bigger the wiggles, the less scientists believe that the dips represent interesting molecules. Any particular dip might instead be just a random, extra-large wiggle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That problem gets even worse when looking at a bright object such as Venus with a powerful telescope like ALMA, says Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Cordiner uses ALMA to observe other objects in the solar system, like Saturn’s moon Titan, but was not involved in the Venus work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reason those bumps and wiggles are here at all is because of the intrinsic brightness of Venus, which makes it difficult to get a reliable measurement,” Cordiner says. “You could think of it as being dazzled by a bright light: If there’s a bright light in your vision, then your ability to pick out fainter details becomes diminished.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So astronomers do a few different things to smooth out the data and let real signals shine through. One strategy is to write an equation that describes the wiggles caused by the noise. Scientists can then subtract that equation from the data to highlight the signal they’re interested in, like fuzzing out the background of a photo to let a portrait subject pop. That’s a standard practice, says Cordiner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s possible to write an equation that fits the noise too well. The simplest equation one could use is just a straight line, also known as a first-order polynomial, described by the equation &lt;em&gt;y=mx+b. &lt;/em&gt;A second-order polynomial adds a term with &lt;em&gt;x &lt;/em&gt;squared, third-order with &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; cubed, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greaves and colleagues used a twelfth-order polynomial, or an equation with twelve terms (plus a constant, the &lt;em&gt;+b&lt;/em&gt; in the equation), to describe the noise in their ALMA data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was a red flag that this needed to be looked at in more detail, and that the results of that polynomial fitting could be untrustworthy,” says Cordiner. Going all the way out to the power of 12 could mean a researcher subtracts more noise than is truly random, allowing them to find things in the data that aren’t really there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see if the researchers were a little overzealous in their polynomial fitting, astrophysicist Ignas Snellen, of Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues reapplied the same noise reduction recipe to the ALMA data on Venus and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09761&quot;&gt;found no statistically significant sign of phosphine&lt;/a&gt;, they report in a paper posted at arXiv.org on October 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers tried the same noise filtering on other parts of Venus’ spectrum, where no interesting molecules should be found. They found five different signals of molecules that aren’t really there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis … shows that at least a handful of spurious features can be obtained with their method, and therefore [we] conclude that the presented analysis does not provide a solid basis to infer the presence of [phosphine] in the Venus atmosphere,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Looking for other data — and getting no help yet&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, scientists at ALMA discovered a separate, unspecified issue in the data that were used to detect the phosphine and took those data off the observatory’s public archive to scrutinize and reprocess, according to a statement from the European Southern Observatory, of which ALMA is a part.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This does not happen very often,” says Martin Zwaan of the ESO ALMA Regional Center in Garching, Germany, but this isn’t a first. When issues are discovered, it is standard practice to reprocess the data. “In many cases, it does not affect the science outcome significantly,” Zwaan says. “In the case of the phosphine on Venus, this [outcome] has not been established yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What can scientists do while they wait? One of the best ways to confirm the phosphine is to see an equivalent signal at a different wavelength in Venus’ spectrum. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&amp;amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/202039559&quot;&gt;the news isn’t great there either&lt;/a&gt;. In a paper to appear in &lt;em&gt;Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics&lt;/em&gt;, astronomer Thérèse Encrenaz of the Paris Observatory and colleagues (including Greaves and some other authors of the original paper) looked at archived data from an infrared spectrograph called TEXES that operates in Hawaii. Those observations could have spotted phosphine in Venus’ cloud tops, a lower part of the sky than what ALMA could see.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greaves and colleagues had approached Encrenaz to look for phosphine in infrared wavelengths before the original paper came out, but those observations were cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. So Encrenaz looked through data she had collected between 2012 and 2015 — and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At the level of the cloud tops, there is no [phosphine] at all,” Encrenaz says. That doesn’t necessarily mean there’s no phosphine higher up in the sky — there’s just no clear explanation for how it would get there. “The reasoning in the paper by Jane Greaves was that phosphine was coming from the clouds,” Encrenaz says. “So there is a big problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;‘This is just what science looks like.’&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are still ways for Venus’ phosphine to pull through. If it varies with time, for instance, it might be there some of the times that astronomers look and not at others. It’s too early to invoke that scenario, though, Cordiner says. “There’s no point of talking about the time variability of a signal if it isn’t there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this is not a crisis, says Clara Sousa-Silva, an astrochemist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., and a coauthor of the original paper. Other groups challenging the finding “is completely normal and what I expected (nay, hoped) would happen,” she wrote in an e-mail. “This is usually a phase of a project that I enjoy, and I am hoping people will realize this is just what science looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The silver lining in all of this is that it’s gotten people excited about Venus, says Byrne, who is a member of NASA’s Venus Exploration Analysis Group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These papers provide much value and a needed assessment of these extraordinary claims,” he says. “If nothing else, it has shone a light on just how little we understand about Venus. And the only way we get those answers is if we go to Venus.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Galileo’s famous gravity experiment holds up, even with individual atoms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092542</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galileo-gravity-experiment-atoms-general-relativity-einstein</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to legend, Galileo dropped weights off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, showing that gravity causes objects of different masses to fall with the same acceleration. In recent years, researchers have taken to replicating this test in a way that the Italian scientist probably never envisioned — by dropping atoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study describes the most sensitive atom-drop test so far and shows that Galileo’s gravity experiment still holds up — even for individual atoms. Two different types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/05071Ya2G641dd7a267f77358e05d5ec64f38c023&quot;&gt;atoms had the same acceleration&lt;/a&gt; within about a part per trillion, or 0.0000000001 percent, physicists report in a paper in press in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with a previous atom-drop test, the new research is a thousand times as sensitive. “It represents a leap forward,” says physicist Guglielmo Tino of the University of Florence, who was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared rubidium atoms of two different isotopes, atoms that contain different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. The team launched clouds of these atoms about 8.6 meters high in a tube under vacuum. As the atoms rose and fell, both varieties accelerated at essentially the same rate, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In confirming Galileo’s gravity experiment yet again, the result upholds the equivalence principle, a foundation of Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. That principle states that an object’s inertial mass, which determines how much it accelerates when force is applied, is equivalent to its gravitational mass, which determines how strong a gravitational force it feels. The upshot: An object’s acceleration under gravity doesn’t depend on its mass or composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, the equivalence principle has withstood all tests. But atoms, which are subject to the strange laws of quantum mechanics, could reveal its weak points. “When you do the test with atoms … you’re testing the equivalence principle and stressing it in new ways,” says physicist Mark Kasevich of Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kasevich and colleagues studied the tiny particles using atom interferometry, which takes advantage of quantum mechanics to make extremely precise measurements. During the atoms’ flight, the scientists put the atoms in a state called a quantum superposition, in which particles don’t have one definite location. Instead, each atom existed in a superposition of two locations, separated by up to seven centimeters. When the atoms’ two locations were brought back together, the atoms interfered with themselves in a way that precisely revealed their relative acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many scientists think that the equivalence principle will eventually falter. “We have reasonable expectations that our current theories … are not the end of the story,” says physicist Magdalena Zych of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who was not involved with the research. That’s because quantum mechanics — the branch of physics that describes the counterintuitive physics of the very small — doesn’t mesh well with general relativity, leading scientists on a hunt for a theory of quantum gravity that could unite these ideas. Many scientists suspect that the new theory will violate the equivalence principle by an amount too small to have been detected with tests performed thus far.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But physicists hope to improve such atom-based tests in the future, for example by performing them in space, where objects can free-fall for extended periods of time. An equivalence principle test in space has already been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-galileo-gravity-experiment-re-created-space-einstein&quot;&gt;performed with metal cylinders&lt;/a&gt;, but not yet with atoms (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/4/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So there’s still a chance to prove Galileo wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: How do researchers evaluate research?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18507</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kucfd8ARAo8/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;PLOS has received a grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/&quot;&gt; P. Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to study how researchers evaluate both the &lt;strong&gt;credibility &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;impact &lt;/strong&gt;of research outputs (e.g. articles, preprints, data, and code). We will be conducting this research in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascb.org/&quot;&gt;American Society for Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(ASCB).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ll be looking at this in two contexts: (1) when researchers are &lt;em&gt;discovering &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;reading &lt;/em&gt;these outputs in the process of their own research, and (2) when they are &lt;em&gt;assessing &lt;/em&gt;these outputs while participating in grant application review panels and hiring committees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are interested in characterizing the steps that researchers go through to form judgments of both credibility and impact in these two contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Why is this new research needed?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research has explored the factors that influence trust and how researchers decide which articles to read and cite, showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-140725&quot;&gt;personal inspection&lt;/a&gt;, social clues, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206&quot;&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;, are important. Recently, preprints have created new challenges for researchers who evaluate large amounts of new information outside of the traditional framework of journal peer review. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux&quot;&gt;survey by the Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt; suggested that cues related to Open Science content (e.g. signaling open availability of data) and independent verification are important for judging credibility of preprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, the current system for assessing research is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914&quot;&gt;dominated by signifiers of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Since impact cannot be known until after time has passed, various proxies have been used that signal perceived, or the potential for, impact such as publication in a high Impact Factor journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS and other organizations, in particular the multi-stakeholder organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA, &lt;/a&gt;have stressed the negative consequences of such a narrow focus on proxies of impact and the need for reform. Most problematically, researchers are pushed to place a higher priority on pursuing these proxies than on making their research &lt;strong&gt;credible&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reproducible, &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;reusable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many have suggested that this focus on proxies for impact in research assessment is at least in part due to the &lt;strong&gt;practical limitations in evaluating credibility and impact&lt;/strong&gt;. By understanding what truly matters to researchers in forming these judgments, we hope to find insights that can inform better practice in research assessment, inspire better tools for researchers, and help us evolve how we signal the markers of credibility in the articles we publish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration with ASCB&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are not undertaking this project alone! We are excited to be conducting this research in collaboration with the ASCB. This partnership helps maximize the connection of this project to the research community. As the organizational sponsor of DORA, ASCB is also a scientific association demonstrably dedicated to advocating sound research policies and improving research culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What comes after the research?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will publish a report on the insights obtained through this research. This report will have a CC BY license, with anonymized and aggregated data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research might include a quantitative initiative to validate the findings with a broader group of researchers. Ultimately, we would like to understand if there are opportunities to better serve researchers’ needs to assess and discover new research than currently available methods. Therefore, we also hope that our initial report will prompt further research by others, which we believe is important for the research and scholarly communication communities. We are very thankful to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for their interest in this research project and dedicated support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/scholarly-communication&quot;&gt;Scholarly Communication&lt;/a&gt; issues in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are confident that improvements to research assessment culture and practice are possible. And we also believe that there is no more important a moment to be doing this, as we experience a global crisis during which unbiased, rigorous, and credible research will play an unprecedented role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful research proposal was inspired and improved by conversations with many representatives from the research, funding, and publishing community. We wish to acknowledge and thank, in particular, Jessica Polka and Ron Vale for insightful discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Mummified llamas yield new insights into Inca ritual sacrifices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092527</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mummified-llamas-peru-inca-ritual-sacrifice</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mummified llamas stashed at a more than 500-year-old site on Peru’s southern coast offer the first direct glimpse of Inca ritual sacrifices of these animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colored strings made from the hair of llamas or closely related animals decorated five naturally mummified llamas found at an Inca administrative center called Tambo Viejo. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2020.183&quot;&gt;Four of those llamas lay together&lt;/a&gt; beneath the floor of a large, rectangular structure, Lidio Valdez, an archaeologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, and his colleagues report in the December &lt;em&gt;Antiquity&lt;/em&gt;. Scattered remains of at least three more llamas were found near the intact animals. Another llama, missing its head and possibly moved from another location, had been placed under the floor of a smaller building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bones of hundreds of llamas had already been found at Tambo Viejo, consistent with Spanish historical accounts of mass llama sacrifices to appease various Inca deities. Those ceremonies involved the slaughter of llamas that were probably butchered and eaten, not interred whole, Valdez’s group says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered llamas were killed as youngsters, bound and likely buried alive (along with live guinea pigs) as part of an event held to win &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-takeovers-not-usually-hostile&quot;&gt;support from local residents for Inca annexation of the region&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/6/11&lt;/em&gt;), the scientists say. Lab exams detected no cuts to llamas’ throats or midsections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Excavation of four mummified llamas&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092529&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102220_bb_llama-sacrifice_inline_rev.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092529&quot;&gt;Excavations at a Peruvian settlement established by the Inca uncovered these four naturally mummified llamas, apparently sacrificed to help cement control over the region.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092529&quot;&gt;L.M. Valdez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Llama sacrifices occurred in front of local audiences, Valdez and his colleagues speculate. Large ovens and remains of partly burned animal bones and sweet potatoes at Tambo Viejo fit a scenario in which public feasts followed ritual sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Archaeological evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clues-child-sacrifices-found-inca-building&quot;&gt;Inca child sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; has also been found elsewhere in Peru &lt;em&gt;(SN: 9/22/10&lt;/em&gt;). But Spanish accounts from the 1600s indicate that Inca authorities most often targeted llamas and guinea pigs as sacrificial offerings, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: We’re More Willing To Use Deceptive Tactics When A Bot Does The Negotiating</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40649</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/27/were-more-willing-to-use-deceitful-tactics-when-a-bot-does-the-negotiating/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence agents play ever more influential roles in our lives. As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11924&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research&lt;/em&gt;, point out, they do everything from suggesting new friends and connections to recommending purchases and filtering the news that reaches us. They are even beginning to drive our cars. Another role that they are tipped to take over is negotiating on our behalf to sell a car, say, or resolve a legal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, reasoned Jonathan Mell and colleagues at the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, it’s important to know whether using a bot might affect how we negotiate —and it turns out that it does. One of the most striking findings from the team’s series of studies is that less experienced negotiators are more willing to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them. The studies also illuminate how our stance on various negotiating tactics alters through experience — information that would be needed to program negotiating bots to accurately represent us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40649&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first online study, 741 participants were asked about their experience in negotiating for good deals or prices. Then they were told to imagine that they were negotiating for something important to them, such as a house or a car. Next, they were told either that they would negotiate for themselves, or they would program a bot to do the job for them. They all then completed the team’s new Agent Negotiation Tactics Inventory (ANTI), indicating just how tough, deceptive and pleasant or otherwise they wanted to be (in the case of the first group) or wanted their bot to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, they could endorse making an opening demand far greater than that they’d be willing to settle for (a “tough” stance) and/or convey a “positive disposition” or express sympathy with the opponent’s plight (and so come across as pleasant). But they could also indicate that they — or their agent — would “strategically express anger toward the opponent to extract concessions” or “convey dissatisfaction with the encounter so that the other party will think he/she is losing interest”. These are both examples of deceptive strategies. The team found that participants who thought about programming the agent to negotiate on their behalf endorsed deceptive tactics more than those thinking about negotiating for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second online study found that more negative previous negotiation experiences (arguing over a deal, for example) were linked to a greater willingness to use deceptive tactics across the board. For the final study, again run online, 190 participants completed the ANTI then engaged in a 10-minute negotiation using an online platform in which “players” must negotiate (using pre-written phrases, questions, statements and also emotion buttons) to split a number of items between them. Each player is told how much each item is worth to them, but they don’t know how much it’s worth to their opponent. In this study, each participant in fact went up against a bot, rather than a human player.  The bots had one of four different negotiating profiles: nice plus competitive, nice plus consensus-building, nasty plus competitive and nasty plus consensus-building. None, however, used any deceptive tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the negotiation, the participants filled out the ANTI again, to indicate how they would behave next time. The team found that whether the agent was nice or nasty didn’t change the ANTI ratings. However, while interacting with a competitive “tough” agent increased endorsement of deceptive tactics, interacting with a “fair” consensus-building agent reduced intentions to be deceptive. Though the agents had not used deception, even brief experience with a hard-ball negotiator bot made the participants more willing to be underhand. As the researchers write, even if participants are initially keen for their representative to negotiate fairly, “exposure to the real world of aggressive, tough negotiators is enough make them forsake their qualms and embrace deception”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When designing future agents to accurately represent us in real-world negotiations, these findings should, then, be taken into account, the researchers say — the work suggests that bots should be programmed to become more deceptive in response to a tough negotiation. As the team writes, “Shying away from this during agent design could lead to unsatisfied users and would have severe implications for the adoption of future agent representative systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: A photon’s journey through a hydrogen molecule is the shortest event ever timed</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092551</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/photon-journey-molecule-shortest-event-zeptosecond-physics</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for a single particle of light to pass through a hydrogen molecule is now the shortest duration ever measured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This interval was &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/339&quot;&gt;about 247 zeptoseconds&lt;/a&gt;, or trillionths of a billionth of a second, researchers report in the Oct. 16 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. For comparison, there are as many zeptoseconds in one second as there are seconds in 2,500 times the age of the universe, which is about 13.8 billion years old. The new observation has allowed physicists to witness light-matter interactions at a whole new level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The physicists shined particles of X-ray light on hydrogen molecules in a gas. As each light particle, or photon, crossed an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, it booted an electron from one hydrogen atom, then the other. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-quantum-theory-particle-wave-double-slit-experiment&quot;&gt;electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/3/19&lt;/em&gt;), the two ejection events stirred up electron waves that spread out and merged — similar to ripples formed by a stone skipped twice over a pond. The overlapping crests and troughs of those waves created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-weirdness&quot;&gt;interference pattern&lt;/a&gt;, which the researchers observed using an instrument called a reaction microscope (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/5/10&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the electron waves had formed simultaneously, the interference pattern would have been symmetric around the center of the H&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;molecule. But because one electron wave formed slightly before the other and had more time to spread out, the pattern shifted toward the second wave, says study coauthor Sven Grundmann, a physicist at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift let the researchers calculate the 247-zeptosecond time delay between the emission of the two electron waves. That matched the team’s expectations based on the speed of light and known diameter of a hydrogen molecule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Past experiments have observed particle interactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pursuit-briefest-beat&quot;&gt;as short as attoseconds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/12/10&lt;/em&gt;), which are 1,000 times as long as zeptoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;width: 701px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;figure__image&quot; data-src=&quot;//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02765-9/d41586-020-02765-9_18456700.jpg&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02765-9/d41586-020-02765-9_18456700.jpg&quot; width=&quot;691&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Credit: Alexander Heinel/Picture Alliance/DPA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;History was made this year when two women, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a genome editing method using CRISPR-Cas9, which has numerous applications in the editing of plant and animal genomes. However, even before the discovery of CRISPR-Cas’ use in DNA editing, the use of genome editing techniques in humans has long been considered unethical, with many countries making it illegal to edit human embryos. In 2018, the highly-controversial birth of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;‘CRISPR babies’&lt;/a&gt; – twin girls allegedly born with CRISPR-edited genomes – shocked the world and renewed discussions about the ethics and legality of such practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cystic fibrosis scenarios as functional examples, Schleidgen &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;explore three consistently-debated issues of human germline therapies in relation to CRISPR-Cas: the risks of using the tool in human germline editing, what responsibilities future generations bear and whether the treatment is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors argue that categorically prohibiting the use of CRISPR-Cas ‘one-generation germline therapies’ – which would theoretically phenotypically cure the developing embryo, but ensure that the changes are not passed onto offspring – would not be legally or ethically justifiable, provided that concepts surrounding human germline editing are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01115-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Assessing risk of bias: a proposal for a unified framework for observational studies and randomized trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no unified guidelines to help individual healthcare professionals (and medical students) assess bias across different study types, an essential skill in the practice of evidence-based medicine. Study type-specific tools do currently exist, such as those that aid in the assessment of bias in observational studies, but can’t be reliably applied to other study types, such as randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luijendijk &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; have identified this gap and also argue that current frameworks are limited in requiring only methodological knowledge to detect bias, as some study aspects may only be appraised using subject-matter knowledge. In order to generate a unified framework, they applied a popular conceptual framework typically used only in observational studies to randomized trials, by defining the research question in terms of study population, intervention and outcome, and using causal diagrams to illustrate how each source of bias can lead to over- or under-estimations of treatment effects. The developed framework allows for the identification of three sources of bias independent of study design: bias due to a common cause, bias due to systematic measurement error, and bias due to a common effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Koli Bacteria, Escherichia Coli, Bacteria, Disease&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;478&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/06/08/08/09/koli-bacteria-123081_960_720.jpg&quot; width=&quot;662&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human gut is colonized by many commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which constitute part of the gut microbiome. Since it was established that the composition of the human gut microbiome can have major impacts on our health, the field of research has rapidly grown; in the last 40 years,&lt;a href=&quot;https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/9/1716?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt; 80% of human gut microbiome research was published between 2013 and 2017.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria&lt;/em&gt; are relatively abundant in the human gut, and attract particular interest due to their potential for use as probiotics (live bacteria that are considered to be good for health) and as targets of prebiotics (substances that increase the abundance or activity of existing bacteria).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Chung &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of AXOS (arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, which have been demonstrated to promote the abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria&lt;/em&gt;) on gut microbiota. They carried out a crossover, randomised, double-blind trial whereby the diets of elderly volunteers were supplemented with AXOS or maltodextrin, and their effects on faecal bacteria and blood serum parameters were measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faecal samples analysed revealed an increase in &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria &lt;/em&gt;observed across the entire cohort in response to AXOS supplementation, independent of the observed inter-individual variation in gut microbiota. However, variation in the levels of baseline &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt; species of gut bacteria did determine how responsive each patient was to AXOS supplementation. The authors conclude that AXOS supplementation is bifidogenic, suggesting that AXOS may be considered a viable prebiotic option in the elderly, and due to the influence of existing gut bacteria on the bifidogenic response, call for the consideration of microbiota profiling when testing the efficacy of prebiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional cigarette smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse effects on both mother and baby health, and is amongst one of the leading preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. The difficulties of quitting smoking during pregnancy have led many to consider alternatives to conventional cigarettes, such as electronic or ‘e’ cigarettes. As they contain fewer toxic chemicals than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are largely believed to have fewer adverse health effects compared to traditional cigarettes, but there is little evidence to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors Sooyong Kim and Sanda Cristina Oancea sought to determine whether e-cigarettes are safer in pregnancy than conventional cigarettes, by extracting and analysing data from the PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) study cohort, a large study that included data on 55,000 pregnancies. Participants were classified into three groups: complete tobacco abstinence, exclusive conventional cigarette use, and exclusive e-cigarette use, and adverse birth outcomes were defined as low birth weight, preterm birth and ‘small for gestational age’. They found that, when compared to conventional cigarette users, the risk of each adverse birth outcome was not significantly reduced, and e-cigarettes cannot be considered to be safer than conventional cigarettes. Following this, the authors encourage the complete abstinence from all tobacco products during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: How malaria parasites hide from the human immune system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092563</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-parasite-mosquitoes-genetics-immune-system</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Malaria parasites survive tough times by not being too clingy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During Africa’s dry season, when mosquitoes are scarce, malaria parasites have a hard time spreading to new hosts. So the parasites hide out in the human body by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1084-0&quot;&gt;keeping the cells they infect&lt;/a&gt; from clinging to blood vessels, researchers report October 26 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; This way, infected cells get removed from circulation and parasite levels in the body remain low, making people less sick and allowing the parasite to persist undetected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long observed that symptoms of malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne infection, tend to wane during the dry season, which runs from January to May. But the reason has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping a low profile during dry months is a successful strategy for the parasite, says Martin Rono, a parasitologist at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust in Kilifi, Kenya, who was not involved in the work. Knowing how malaria parasites persist without causing disease, until mosquitoes return to ferry the organisms from an infected person to the next victim could help efforts to control malaria during the dry season.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt;, the parasite responsible for malaria, infects red blood cells as part of a complex life cycle. Once inside a cell, the parasite produces proteins that dock on the cell’s exterior and make it stick to blood vessels so that it won’t be carried to the spleen, where it would otherwise get removed from the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, only the early life stages of the parasite circulate in the blood, while older parasites thrive inside red blood cells adhered to blood vessels, says Silvia Portugal, a biologist who led the work while at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. “That’s textbook, so it was very surprising” to see that dry-season parasites behaved differently in the lab, she says—the cells weren’t sticking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Portugal, now at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, and her colleagues identified around 600 people in Mali infected with malaria in 2017 and 2018. First, the team ruled out two other ideas to explain the parasite’s seasonality: genetic diversity and immunity. Genetically distinct parasites did not hit at different seasons, nor did the host immune system suppress the parasite’s growth, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers compared which genes were turned on or off in samples taken from asymptomatic people in the dry season and symptomatic people in the wet season, they saw that 1,607 genes had distinct seasonal patterns. In the dry season, 1,131 genes were turned on that were off in wet-season parasites. Another 476 were turned off in dry-season parasites, suggesting that when the wet season ends, &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/em&gt; may alter its genetics to make red blood cells less sticky. That allows the parasite to replicate and persist without setting off alarm bells that alert the immune system to fight the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood cells infected with malaria use certain proteins to adhere to blood vessels almost like Velcro, Portugal says. The loss of stickiness could be because the parasite makes fewer of these proteins, or because the proteins are different in some way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still unclear, however, which specific genes are involved in the shift. One issue is that the researchers compared parasites from two different life stages, says Abdirahman Abdi, a parasitologist also at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust. To narrow down which genes may be affecting stickiness, he says, the researchers may need to compare genetic activity in parasites at the same stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Water exists on sunny parts of the moon, scientists confirm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092558</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-moon-sun-sofia-telescope</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Past observations have suggested that there’s water on the moon. New telescope observations conclude that those findings hold water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft have seen evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-running-lunar-mission-reveals-moon-surprises&quot;&gt;water ice in permanently shadowed craters&lt;/a&gt; at the lunar poles (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/9/16&lt;/em&gt;), as well as hints of water molecules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/damp-moon-water-found-inside-and-out&quot;&gt;on the sunlit surface&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/23/09&lt;/em&gt;). But water sightings in sunlit regions have relied on detection of infrared light at a wavelength that could also be emitted by other hydroxyl compounds, which contain hydrogen and oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-01222-x&quot;&gt;has detected an infrared signal unique to water near the lunar south pole&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online October 26 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the first unambiguous detection of molecular water on the sunlit moon,” says study coauthor Casey Honniball, a lunar scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “This shows that water is not just in the permanently shadowed regions — that there are other places on the moon that we could potentially find it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These observations could inform future missions to the moon that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-landed-moon-missions-apollo-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;will scout out lunar water as a potential resource&lt;/a&gt; for human visitors (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/16/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;SOFIA, operated by NASA and the German Aerospace Center, is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/120-seconds-plutos-shadow&quot;&gt;2.5-meter telescope that rides aboard a jumbo jet&lt;/a&gt; to get clear views of the sky (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/17/16&lt;/em&gt;). During a flight in August 2018, the telescope detected 6-micrometer infrared light emanating from a region near the moon’s southern Clavius crater. This wavelength of light is generated by the vibrations of sunlight-heated water molecules, but not other compounds containing hydroxyl, which consists of an oxygen atom bound to a hydrogen atom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was really brilliant” to confirm the presence of water on the moon with observations at this wavelength, says Jessica Sunshine, a planetary scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park. Sunshine was involved in past observations that spotted hints of water on the moon, but was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the brightness of the observed infrared light, Honniball’s team calculated a water concentration of about 100 to 400 parts per million around the Clavius crater. That’s less than half a liter of water per metric ton of lunar soil. This concentration was about what the researchers expected, based on past spacecraft observations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These water molecules are not frozen in ice, like the water in permanently shadowed regions of the moon. Nor is it liquid, Sunshine says. “There’s no moon puddles.” Instead, the water molecules are thought to be bound inside some other material on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only way for us to be seeing water on the [sunlit] moon is if it is sheltered from this harsh environment,” Honniball says. These water molecules could be encased in glass forged by micrometeorite impacts, or wedged between soil grains that shield the water from blistering solar radiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Water could have formed on the moon itself, from hydrogen ions in the continual outward flow of charged particles from the sun &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/sun-may-make-most-water-moons-surface&quot;&gt;reacting with oxygen on the surface&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/6/14&lt;/em&gt;). Or, if the water is stored in impact glass, it could have been delivered to the moon by micrometeorites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Author Interview: Luca Morgantini on Burnout among Healthcare Professionals in COVID-19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18445</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/r-sIMq0e_IE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Luca Morgantini worked with a diverse group of researchers to survey healthcare professionals across the globe to study the degree of burnout they were experiencing. For their &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238217&quot;&gt;Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey&lt;/a&gt;, they surveyed 2,700 individuals across 60 countries in April 2020 and found that burnout had generally increased compared to pre-pandemic times. I asked Luca on whether there were any surprises he came across during this study, the scientific communities’ response to the crisis and more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper seems outside the scope of your usual work. How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: I decided to document the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers the moment I saw non-medical parts of our society downplay what was happening in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was starting to spread in Europe and North America. This research is important because we gathered data during the height of the pandemic, providing solid foundations for future healthcare policies while avoiding recall biases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was evident from the reports of my Chinese friends and colleagues how serious was this disease, with Wuhan going on lockdown in late January. I observed how the infection slowly spread to the rest of the world hitting Italy, my home country, particularly hard. I completed my medical training in Milan, where my colleagues found themselves working in the red zone without adequate protection or directives from their supervisors. Soon the pandemic reached the United States, where I am currently living. While study is outside my usual scope of work, as a healthcare professional and researcher I felt the need to play my part in the fight against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I note that you originally uploaded the manuscript to MedRxiv as a preprint. At what time in your career did you start thinking about Open Science, and why is it important to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: I believe that Open Science is essential for a fair and accessible future of science. Paywalls and other accessibility restrictions disproportionally affect early-career investigators or individuals with less economic means. I have been personally impacted by these paywalls, as institutions often cannot offer a subscription to all the countless scientific publishers. I understand there is a delicate balance between accessibility and profit, but I am convinced that other business models are feasible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My team chose to publish a preprint on MedRxiv and then published our article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, because one of the purposes of our research is to make all our collected data freely available for other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You additionally opted to publish your peer review history with your publication. What led you to this decision and how important do you think transparency of the review process is?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: We decided to publish the peer review history for two reasons. First, we believe this is a way to recognize the tremendous work done by the Editor and the Reviewers. They significantly contributed to the relevance of our manuscript by providing constructive comments, and we want to acknowledge their role in our publication by making their comments public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, we believe in the importance of a transparent review process. This will allow other researchers investigating this field to understand what the concerns of the reviewers were.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you consider this research interdisciplinary? If so, how crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of this type of research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: Burnout is a complex phenomenon and an interdisciplinary approach allowed our team to evaluate it from different perspectives. My co-authors have different backgrounds in urology, psychiatry, biostatistics and epidemiology research. The heterogeneity of our team was essential in creating a short but comprehensive questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An interdisciplinary team of reviewers is important for the same reasons. Analyzing such complex arguments from different points of view is required to better assess the eventual limitations of each study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were you particularly surprised by anything your study uncovered or were the results generally what you expected?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: To be honest, we were simply amazed by the number of healthcare professionals that participated in our study. I feel that they appreciated our process because we were as inclusive as possible, considering parts of the healthcare workforce and geographical areas that are often overlooked in healthcare research. From the comments we received, we noticed how they appreciated our effort to study their quality of work and life, and their willingness to make their COVID-19 experiences count.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising results was the selflessness and dedication of healthcare workers: the vast majority is willing to continue working despite the obvious risk. Their main concern is not infecting themselves, but bringing the virus home to friends and loved ones. These results were consistent across all countries, genders, and healthcare professions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your Conclusion, you mention a few actions that could potentially mitigate burnout for healthcare professionals. Are there any that you would particularly like to see pursued by institutions and other stakeholders?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: It is evident how our society and healthcare systems were not ready to withstand the first wave of a global pandemic. When the Spanish flu infected an estimated half a billion individuals around a century ago, the scientific community was only starting to understand what viruses are and how pandemics evolve. COVID-19 is the first true global pandemic where modern science can play an active and aware role. This is an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to document and understand how to improve the condition of frontline healthcare workers. The manuscript we published represents only one of the hundreds of studies that are being conducted on this topic that all together will contribute to mitigating the negative effects of future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, we observed how training was mostly reported to be ineffective and how adequate protective equipment was rarely available. We understood how healthcare workers are more concerned about their families than themselves, and future policies that would assure the safety of their loved ones, such as periodical testing, kindergartens, or short term rentals close to hospitals, would greatly improve their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What have you seen from peers and the scientific community as a whole during the COVID-19 pandemic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is performing an extraordinary and unprecedented synergic effort towards improving diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. I felt this willingness to help and collaborate while conducting this research, where I received tremendous support from my institution, colleagues, and expert researchers. The lessons learned during these difficult times will greatly help our scientific community and will help build a collaborative and constructive future. I am grateful to be part of this collective scientific effort that is one of the positive lessons to be learnt from this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Comments from the Editor&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Michio Murakami, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, speaks on the significance of Luca’s work and the need to work through differences to improve our world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MM: Among the many published COVID-19-related papers, the paper by Morgantini et al. is particularly significant. First, they conducted a rapid survey of 60 countries, highlighting that burnout of healthcare professionals is an important issue around the world. Second, it points out the importance of training and organizational support as a solution to address burnout. Ultimately, the paper points out an issue that is shared globally and presents findings that can lead to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 and the associated social response pose a diverse range of physical and socio-psychological health problems. Some of these issues relate to discrimination, prejudice and social division. Different values and cultural worldviews, depending on the identity and position of individuals and groups, may lead to different opinions and social division. We need to be respectful of our values to individuals and different groups, and increase awareness of the fact that society is built on mutual reciprocity. There are shared goals and a vision of the world we can aspire to, even though our values may differ.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there are many aspects of our health that is supported by healthcare professionals, and none of us want a world in which many healthcare professionals leave their work. This paper by Morgantini et al. provides useful insights on this global issues that should be addressed and encourages further discussion about the vision of the world we aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I extend my gratitude to both Luca and Michio for providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: When People Are Better Able To Rely On Their Own Resources, Group Cooperation Breaks Down</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40629</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/26/when-people-are-better-able-to-rely-on-their-own-resources-group-cooperation-breaks-down/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you live in a village which is threatened with rising sea levels. If you don’t do anything, your home is going to be flooded. You could pool your resources together with other villagers and build a large dam around the entire village to ensure that everyone’s property is safe. Or, if you have enough resources yourself, you could build a smaller dam around your own house, protecting your property — and leaving everyone else to either do the same or try and co-operate without you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human societies constantly face similar choices between public and private solutions to pressing issues: think about the provision of healthcare or education, for instance. But only some people can afford to build a dam around their own house, or send their child to a private school. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18896-6&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that when group members are able to be self-reliant in this way, the provision of public goods suffers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40629&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jörg Gross and colleagues at Leiden University recruited 200 participants, who were divided into 50 groups of four to play an economic game. Across a series of rounds, each participant chose how many of their personal “resource points” to invest in both a public and private fund. If the four participants collectively put enough points into the public fund to reach a certain threshold, then they would each be able to keep any of their remaining uninvested points, which could later be converted into real cash (this is like the villagers coming together to invest enough to successfully create a large dam, write the authors).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the group failed to invest enough to meet the public threshold, then they wouldn’t be protected as a group. But if an individual had put enough points into their &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; fund, they would still be able to keep their uninvested points (in other words, they had invested enough to complete their own private “dam”). If neither threshold was met, then that person would lose all their uninvested points for the round.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tweaked a few rules between groups and across the course of the game. In half of the groups, participants each had 90 points at their disposal every round. But in the other half, points were distributed unequally: two participants were given 120 points and two were given just 60. And while the threshold for the public solution was always set at 180 points, the cost of the &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; one varied between 45 to 75 points, and in some rounds was not even an option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that when a private solution wasn’t available, the participants worked together, and on nearly 80% of trials successfully invested the 180 points needed for the public solution. This was true whether resources were distributed equally or unequally within the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things changed when there was the possibility of creating a private solution. The cheaper the private solution, the more likely participants were to invest in it, and the less likely groups were to successfully invest in the public alternative. In groups in which resources were distributed unequally, this left the two poorer participants in a tricky place. Remember, these participants had just 60 points each, so were either forced to rely on contributions from the wealthier participants to meet the 180 point threshold for the public solution, or had to spend almost all of their points on the private option (in the rounds where they could afford it). The two wealthier participants, on the other hand, could be much more self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the wealthier participants did indeed co-operate with their poorer counterparts to create a public solution. But often they made no contributions to public funds at all, particularly when the private solution was cheap. And overall they dedicated a smaller proportion of their resources to the public fund than did the poorer participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This all had the knock-on effect of increasing the “wealth gap” between participants. As private options got cheaper, the wealthier, self-reliant participants were able to save more uninvested points to convert into cash. But at the same time, the poorer participants ended up saving &lt;em&gt;fewer &lt;/em&gt;uninvested points, presumably because they could no longer depend on there being a public option, and so were forced to spend most of their points on the private solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study shows that groups can co-operate well when they need to, write the authors. But as people amass wealth and are able to be more self-reliant, they become less dependent on the group, which undermines that cooperation. “With increased self-reliance, groups increasingly fail to efficiently create public goods which amplifies wealth inequalities [and] undermines social cohesion,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lab-based economic game doesn’t reflect all the nuances of how public and private services work in the real world. Fortunately, people have no choice but to contribute to many public services — healthcare, schools, and so on — through their taxes, even if they opt to use private alternatives themselves. Still, the study lays bare a friction that clearly exists in society— even if the results are not entirely surprising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18896-6&quot;&gt;Self-reliance crowds out group cooperation and increases wealth inequality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The longest trail of fossilized human footprints hints at a risky Ice Age trek</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092537</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/longest-trail-fossilized-human-footprints-risky-ice-age-trek</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On a day during the late Ice Age, a young adult or teen carrying a toddler hustled across a muddy flat where mammoths and giant sloths roamed. Now, over 10,000 years later, fossilized footprints reveal that possibly perilous journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tracks, found in New Mexico’s White Sands National Park, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379120305722&quot;&gt;stretch for nearly 1.5 kilometers across the plain&lt;/a&gt; and back, making them the longest set ever found, researchers report in the Dec. 1 &lt;em&gt;Quaternary Science Reviews.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The length of the trackway is really exceptional and give us a prolonged window into the behavior of the individuals,” says evolutionary biologist Kevin Hatala of Chatham University in Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the research. It evokes a personal and intimate connection with our ancestors, as many people today can relate to the feeling of holding a child in their arms, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists stumbled across the find when, in 2018, they spied a continuous stretch of dark spots along what was once the shore of the ancient Lake Otero, now dried up. A little digging revealed fossilized human footprints as well as those from a mammoth and ground sloth.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Of the 427 human footprints discovered, researchers analyzed 90. The size and the depth of the footprints suggest that they had been made by a teen or a young woman, the researchers say. Uneven prints hint that the surface was slippery and that on one leg of the journey, the person at times shifted a heavy load. That load appeared to be a child: Smaller prints from perhaps a 3-year-old appeared next to the larger footprints in several spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks like the person was in a hurry, we don’t know why. It was a fast walk and looks like the person was tired… but kept going,” says David Bustos, a biologist at the White Sands National Park.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fossilized human footprints&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092538&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102120_ap_footprints_inline1-673x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;673&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092538&quot;&gt;A set of fossilized human footprints (closeup of one, right) found at White Sands National Park in New Mexico extend some 1.5 kilometers along what was once a lake. The person followed the same route out and back (left) during the late Ice Age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092538&quot;&gt;M.R. Bennett &lt;em&gt;et al/Quaternary Science Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That hurry might have been due to the riskiness of the journey. Previously found footprints from the area came from groups of people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/25/18&lt;/em&gt;). They likely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-prove-humans-hunted-giant-sloths-during-ice-age&quot;&gt;moved in groups to safely hunt animals&lt;/a&gt; such as mammoths, sloths and wolves, Bustos says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, footprints from a mammoth and ground sloth crisscrossed the human prints; in some spots, the human footprints came first while in others, the human stepped on the other animals’ tracks. Based on when those animals went extinct, researchers were able to broadly date the human footprints to the late Ice Age.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it is unclear if the mammoth sensed the human presence, the giant ground sloth rose onto its hind legs and moved in circles, suggesting that it knew that there was a human nearby, the researchers say. It’s possible that such animals were coming in contact with humans on a regular basis, Hatala says.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>PLOS ONE has issued an expression of concern for a paper it published last month suggesting that vitamin D might protect against severe COVID-19.  Central to the concerns is that the authors seem to have been too far out over their skis in asserting a link between the vitamin and the response to the infection. … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/26/paper-suggesting-vitamin-d-might-protect-against-covid-19-earns-an-expression-of-concern/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Paper suggesting vitamin D might protect against COVID-19 earns an expression of concern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex is found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lateral sulcus&lt;/a&gt;. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superior temporal gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heschl’s gyri&lt;/a&gt; (aka the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transverse temporal gyri&lt;/a&gt;). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sulcus&lt;/a&gt; (or beyond).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;belt&lt;/em&gt; region, and surrounding that is an area often called the &lt;em&gt;parabelt &lt;/em&gt;region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medial geniculate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a &lt;em&gt;tonotopic&lt;/em&gt; map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (&lt;em&gt;Frequency&lt;/em&gt;, when referring to sound waves, is related to &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt;. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlea&lt;/a&gt;, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt; contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

	<title>Science News: Why bat scientists are socially distancing from their subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092406</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-people-spillover-transmission-coronavirus-covid-19</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing Winifred Frick likes better than crawling through guano-filled caves and coming face-to-face with bats. As chief scientist of Bat Conservation International, she is on a mission to promote understanding of bats and protect imperiled species from extinction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For months, though, Frick has avoided research that would put her within spitting distance of bats. Her only projects to persist through the pandemic have been conducted from afar, like using acoustic monitors to eavesdrop on the animals’ squeaks and swooshes. In an era of COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008758&quot;&gt;that “hands-off” approach and other precautions are crucial to protect both bats and people&lt;/a&gt;, Frick, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and over two dozen other scientists argue online September 3 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the call to action? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature&quot;&gt;likely originated in bats in China&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). But neither it nor other coronaviruses belonging to the same genus — &lt;em&gt;Betacoronavirus —&lt;/em&gt; have been detected in the more than 40 bat species in North America, although the animals do harbor other types of coronaviruses. Scientists are not worried about catching SARS-CoV-2 &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; these bats. They’re afraid of giving it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the bats — not an impossibility, the authors argue, given that the United States leads the world in infections, with nearly 8 million as of October 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can’t tell bats to socially distance,” Frick says. “We want to reduce the chance that there’s any pathogen transfer across animals, full stop.” The goal is to prevent viral “spillover.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Biologist Winifred Frick&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092408&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101620_jo_bat_inline_680-675x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092408&quot;&gt;Biologist Winifred Frick advocates for distanced research methods and extra protective gear to safeguard North American bats from the coronavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092408&quot;&gt;Alan Hicks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human-to-bat transmission isn’t an unheard-of scenario. People are likely to blame for introducing &lt;em&gt;Pseudogymnoascus destructans, &lt;/em&gt;the fungus that causes white nose syndrome, to North American bats. The disease has killed millions of bats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/white-nose-bat-disease-jumps-rockies-washington-state&quot;&gt;throughout the United States and Canada&lt;/a&gt; since it was first detected in 2006 &lt;em&gt;(SN: 3/31/16)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown if bats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or if the virus would make them sick — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people&quot;&gt;bats rarely become ill from the viruses they carry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SN: 2/12/20). &lt;/em&gt;But infected bats might spread the virus back to humans, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Worse, introducing SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses carried by North American bats could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-china-carry-all-ingredients-make-new-sars-virus&quot;&gt;provide the ingredients for creating a new virus&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/30/17).&lt;/em&gt; Either scenario could stoke pre-existing fears about bats spreading disease, presenting a major hurdle for bat conservationists trying to bolster support for the animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s bat specialist group, which includes Frick, initially advocated for the hands-off approach in April. Because so little was known in the early days of the pandemic about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads, that group recommended that researchers shut down any projects that involved interacting with bats. In August, the group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnbsg.org/bsg-publications.html&quot;&gt;updated its guidelines to also address&lt;/a&gt; spelunking and other activities that might bring humans into bat habitat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines still recommend replacing fieldwork with distanced alternatives whenever possible. Picking through guano can identify bat species and reveal the viruses they carry, and cameras positioned outside bat caves and roosts can give a sense of abundance. Scientists can even resurrect evidence of pathogens held in the preserved tissues of bat specimens in museums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But not all bat research can be socially distanced, and that means taking pandemic precautions, like ensuring field crews aren’t sick with COVID-19 and are wearing personal protective gear. White nose syndrome research already requires disposable Tyvek suits and gloves to reduce spreading the fungus. Now, masks will be a regular part of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Frick, speaking up for bats has always been a part of being a bat biologist. Besides having a passion for the animals, conservation and human health are inseparable, she says. And bats provide ecosystem services that benefit humans, like pest control that &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1201366&quot;&gt;saves North American farmers more than an estimated $3.7 billion per year&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study published in 2011 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. As human populations expand into shrinking bat habitat, bats and humans increasingly cross paths, making viral spillover events and other harmful interactions more likely. The pandemic has intensified those risks, and for Frick, put the need to speak up “on steroids now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve probably heard tales of people who are suddenly able to speak a language they didn’t know while hypnotised&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes without saying that the evidence doesn’t really support these claims — but it’s interesting that linguistics seems to attract this sort of pseudoscientific idea. At &lt;em&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2020/fact-or-fantasy-tales-linguistic-fringe&quot;&gt;Charles Q. Choi discusses “fantastic linguistics” with historical linguist Sarah Thomason&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40617&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists are increasingly recognising the influence of our internal states, such as heart rate, on our mental processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers studying “interoception” hope that a better awareness of what’s going on in the body could help people manage symptoms of anxiety and other mental health conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sarah-garfinkel-interoception&quot;&gt;João Medeiros has more&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to place too much value on the ending of an experience, which can bias our view of the experience as a whole&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/brain-can-overvalue-a-happy-ending-study&quot;&gt;reports Ali Pattillo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;. A recent study found that the brain encodes the overall value of an experience in the amygdala, while dislike of a disappointing ending is represented in the insula. Whether we make good choices or are unduly influenced by the ending of an experience seems to be related to the pattern of activity in those two areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the internet age, pornography is more accessible than ever —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and many people have voiced concern about its harmful effects. &lt;/strong&gt;But what does the research actually say about the consequences of viewing porn? Well, like so much in psychology, the story is complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/is-pornography-harmful/&quot;&gt;Zoe Cormier explores some of the nuances&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chimpanzees show a similar pattern of “social ageing” to humans, with the size of their social networks shrinking in older age. &lt;/strong&gt;And just like us, older chimps also seem to have stronger social bonds than their younger counterparts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/22/chimps-pare-down-their-social-circle-in-later-years-study&quot;&gt;reports Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: The arthritis drug tocilizumab doesn’t appear to help fight COVID-19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092531</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-arthritis-drug-tocilizumab-not-promising</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An initial crop of clinical trials testing an anti-inflammatory drug against COVID-19 do not look promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best available evidence among these trials “doesn’t show that this drug is beneficial,” says Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious diseases physician at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug, tocilizumab, is a treatment for the painful joint swelling that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and is also used to manage a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective&quot;&gt;dangerous side effect of the cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; CAR-T cell therapy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/18&lt;/em&gt;). So clinical trials have been assessing whether tocilizumab might help COVID-19 patients by taming excessive inflammation as it does for these other two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin 6, which contributes to the immune system’s inflammatory response. High levels of this protein, known as a cytokine, are a harbinger of severe disease in COVID-19 patients, studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Of the four clinical trials that have just reported peer-reviewed results on tocilizumab for COVID-19, only one meets the “gold standard” for evaluating a drug.  Such randomized, double-blinded controlled trials randomly assign patients to receive a drug or a placebo, and don’t reveal to participants or doctors who is getting which.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the trial with this design, tocilizumab &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2028836&quot;&gt;did not reduce the risk of intubation or death&lt;/a&gt; as of four weeks compared with the placebo, researchers reported online in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on October 21. The study included 243 participants hospitalized with COVID-19 at seven Boston hospitals. Two-thirds received the drug, while the remainder received the placebo; participants also got other available drugs for COVID-19, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain&quot;&gt;remdesivir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two other trials randomly assigned which participants received tocilizumab but did not use a placebo, and it was clear whether patients were receiving the drug or not. This knowledge can bias the interpretation of some measures of how a patient is faring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these two studies had mixed results. Tocilizumab may have reduced the likelihood of patients needing ventilation or dying as of two weeks compared with those who didn’t receive the drug. But there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6820?guestAccessKey=14a265c4-49ae-44a2-ac1e-4ed9bc9181f6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;no difference in mortality&lt;/a&gt; between the two groups at four weeks, researchers reported online October 20 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; In the trial of 131 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at nine hospitals in France, about half got tocilizumab along with regular care (such as antiviral drugs), while the remainder received just regular care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other study of 126 patients in 24 hospitals in Italy found that the drug didn’t appear to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6615?guestAccessKey=05e037ab-d891-4213-b298-6b97f63fd8f7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;stop the disease from getting worse&lt;/a&gt; compared with standard care, researchers reported in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;also on October 20&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; About half the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia got the drug. The other half received standard care but could get tocilizumab if their condition worsened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The data from randomized controlled trials published to date do not support routine use of tocilizumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,” says Carolyn Calfee, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved in the trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some blanks still to be filled in, though. The trials didn’t evaluate patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19, namely those with acute respiratory distress syndrome on a ventilator, Calfee says. It’s also unclear whether categorizing patients by how much their interleukin 6 level is elevated might help identify patients who could benefit from the drug, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only study that found tocilizumab helpful had a weaker design. It was an observational study, so not randomized. The participants who received the drug had different characteristics from those who didn’t, which makes it difficult to determine whether the results are due to the drug or other factors. By 30 days, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6252?guestAccessKey=8a81e35e-df54-4c43-8729-d5d28e48b666&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;risk of mortality was lower&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalized patients who took the drug in the first two days upon admission than for patients who didn’t, researchers report online October 20 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhimraj says results from the remaining “gold standard” clinical trials still under way will be needed to better understand whether tocilizumab has a use in treating COVID-19. One trial offered preliminary results in a news release and reported that participants were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system&quot;&gt;less likely to need intubation or die&lt;/a&gt; with the drug (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/22/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: Bat-winged dinosaurs were clumsy fliers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092522</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-bat-wings-clumsy-evolution-flying-gliding</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Only two dinosaur species are known to have had wings made out of stretched skin, like bats. But unlike bats, these dinos were capable of only limited gliding between trees, a new anatomical analysis suggests. That bat-winged gliding turned out to be a dead end along the path to the evolution of flight, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are a failed experiment,” says Alexander Dececchi, a paleontologist at Mount Marty University in Sioux Falls, S.D.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fliers with feathered wings, rather than membranous wings, begin to appear in the fossil record just a few million years after the bat-winged dinosaurs. Those feathered fliers &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/&quot;&gt;may have outcompeted the gliders&lt;/a&gt; in their evolutionary niche, Dececchi and colleagues suggest October 22 in &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-ride-may-have-been-glide&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yi qi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx longibrachium&lt;/em&gt; were crow-sized dinosaurs that lived about 160 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/15&lt;/em&gt;). They were distant cousins, both belonging to a bizarre group of dinosaurs known as scansoriopterygids. Unlike other scansoriopterygids, however, these two species sported large wings with membranes, thin skin stretched between elongated arm bones.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scansoriopterygids were a branch of theropod dinosaurs, the same group that includes giants like &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; as well as the ancestors of birds. So the recent discoveries of two different bat-winged theropod dinosaurs shook up long-standing ideas about the evolution of flight in birds. Scientists had thought that path, while a bit circuitous, centered around variations of just one basic, birdlike body plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But whether &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; were actually adept at flying, such as being able to launch from the ground or flap their wings, wasn’t clear. To assess the dinos’ flight capability, Dececchi and colleagues used laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging, which can pick up details of soft tissues such as membranes or cartilage in fossils, to reanalyze the anatomy of &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx.&lt;/em&gt; The team made new estimations of the reptiles’ weight, wing shape and wingspan, and then simulated how those features might translate into flapping, gliding or launching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new analyses confirm that these two dinosaurs had vastly different wing structures from the feathered-wing fliers — proving that these two flight strategies evolved independently of one another. &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, for example, had elongated forelimb bones between their membranous wings, as well as a special wrist bone to help support the membrane. The skeletons of the wings of birds, on the other hand, consist of elongated metacarpals, similar to finger bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This evolutionary branching out was ultimately a failure, Dececchi says. &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; were capable only of gliding short distances from tree to tree, the team found. Their body mass-to-wing ratio was a bit too high for them to stay aloft to glide longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for active flight, the dinosaurs lacked other attributes possessed by powerful fliers, whether feather-winged like birds or membrane-winged like pterosaurs and bats. For example, the orientation of the dinosaurs’ wings suggests that they weren’t designed for rotational flapping. And the dinos’ breastbones show no evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-had-wings-made-flapping-not-just-gliding&quot;&gt;places where key flight muscles attach&lt;/a&gt; in modern birds (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a few million years after &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, about 150 million years ago, the ancient bird &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; appears in the fossil record. Although &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t a particularly great flier either, Dececchi says, it was a stronger glider and possibly could flap its wings a bit. Later variations on its body theme continued to improve dinosaurs’ flight ability, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That the bat-winged dinosaurs weren’t great fliers isn’t a surprise, says paleontologist Jingmai O’Connor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who with her colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1137-z&quot;&gt;described &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; in a 2019 study in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. O’Connor notes that no bat-winged dinosaurs appear in the fossil record after the Jurassic Period, so it already seemed likely that they weren’t a successful group of dinosaurs. Still, she says, it’s important to do this kind of careful, quantitative analysis to assess flight ability — although “the fossil record of this group is really bad.” With so few fossils, many poorly preserved, any such calculations are going to be based on “very poor data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O’Connor says that what the animals do highlight is “the experimentation with different modes of flight,” she adds. Birds, it’s clear, weren’t the only flying dinosaurs — and these fossils reveal that flight itself, whether gliding or powered, evolved multiple times among them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Viewing Images Of Injuries Can Enhance People’s Sadistic Tendencies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40607</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/22/viewing-images-of-injuries-can-enhance-peoples-sadistic-tendencies/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long discussed the idea that there exists a set of “dark” personality traits alongside the more benign Big Five — so much so, in fact, that one team of researchers argued that too&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/22/psychopaths-and-narcissists-have-hogged-the-limelight-now-its-time-to-explore-the-saintlier-side-of-human-personality-say-researchers-as-they-announce-a-test-of-the-light-triad-traits/&quot;&gt; much time had been spent pondering the darker side&lt;/a&gt; of human nature and that a “Light Triad” was needed to counteract it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is also debate around whether such traits — psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism and sadism — are stable, or whether they can be induced. The most famous exploration of the question is almost certainly Zimbardo’s Prison Experiment, which claimed that being in a powerful position over others — in this case, acting as a prison guard — could induce sadistic behaviour in apparently non-sadistic people. The experiment’s influence is undeniable; it’s even been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XN2X72jrFk&quot;&gt;made into a film&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/03/newly-analysed-recording-challenges-zimbardos-account-of-his-infamous-prison-experiment/&quot;&gt;subject to criticism&lt;/a&gt;, casting some doubt over the extent of its findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305493?dgcid=rss_sd_all#s0005&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; has joined the conversation, examining whether sadistic tendencies can be induced. The study finds that they can — particularly in people who already have some level of sadistic interest — but leaves a question mark over what that might mean for real world behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40607&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Leonie Themelidis and Jason Davies from Swansea University recruited 322 participants to take part in the study. First, participants completed the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies measure, in which they rated themselves on various statements measuring the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; sadistic or cruel behaviour (e.g. “I enjoy mocking losers to their face”) and the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; such behaviour without taking part (e.g. “I love YouTube clips of people fighting”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, participants were split into two groups. One group saw 20 images of hands being given accidental or self-inflicted injuries (such as being cut while chopping vegetables), while a control group saw similar images without any depiction of injury. For each picture, participants completed an “empathy rating”, designed to make them think about how the person in the photograph might feel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants filled in another scale designed to screen sadistic personalities, rating on a scale from one to five how much they agreed with statements including “hurting people would be exciting” and “I enjoy seeing people hurt”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their analysis, the researchers split the participants into groups depending on whether they had low, medium, or high sadism scores at the beginning of the study. Among people with low scores, those who viewed the images of harm showed very slightly higher levels of sadism at the end of the study compared to those who viewed the control images.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this effect was much more pronounced in those participants who had higher levels of sadism to begin with, supporting the hypothesis that images of harm can increase sadistic feeling. Female participants also tended to show a greater increase in sadism after viewing the pain pictures compared to males. This suggests that while to some degree sadism remains stable over time, particular states and contexts may increase it to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; the images induced sadism, however, is unclear. The team makes two suggestions: that viewing pain was simply enjoyable to those with sadistic traits, or that the pictures triggered an elaborate fantasy or recall process, increasing sadistic feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to make too strong a conclusion about what the findings might say about sadistic behaviour. For one, the follow-up measure took place immediately after viewing images of harm, so the increase in feeling experienced by the participants may not endure over time. And the team only measured sadistic feelings and tendencies, so it’s unclear whether this kind of intervention actually produces changes in people’s &lt;em&gt;behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also worth pointing out the scales included questions related to videogames (enjoying watching blood spurt in violent games) and sports (MMA matches) — things that many people enjoy harmlessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;with little or no impact&lt;/a&gt; on their behaviour. Future research may look into the correlation between sadistic urges and the likelihood of actually harming others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305493?dgcid=rss_sd_all#s0005&quot;&gt;Creating evil: Can sadism be induced?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_749&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;t&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of arXiv Video Screenshot&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-749 size-full&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science News: Homo erectus, not humans, may have invented the barbed bone point</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092444</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-not-humans-invented-barbed-bone-point-tool</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A type of bone tool generally thought to have been invented by Stone Age humans got its start among hominids that lived hundreds of thousands of years before &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; evolved, a new study concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of 52 previously excavated but little-studied animal bones from East Africa’s Olduvai Gorge includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248420301469&quot;&gt;the world’s oldest known barbed bone point&lt;/a&gt;, an implement probably crafted by now-extinct &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; at least 800,000 years ago, researchers say. Made from a piece of a large animal’s rib, the artifact features three curved barbs and a carved tip, the team reports in the November &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the Olduvai bones, biological anthropologist Michael Pante of Colorado State University in Fort Collins and colleagues identified five other tools from more than 800,000 years ago as probable choppers, hammering tools or hammering platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/african-finds-revise-cultural-roots&quot;&gt;The previous oldest barbed bone points&lt;/a&gt; were from a central African site and dated to around 90,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/95&lt;/em&gt;), and were assumed to reflect a toolmaking ingenuity exclusive to &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Those implements include carved rings around the base of the tools where wooden shafts were presumably attached. Barbed bone points found at &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; sites were likely used to catch fish and perhaps to hunt large land prey.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Olduvai Gorge barbed bone point, which had not been completed, shows no signs of having been attached to a handle or shaft. Ways in which &lt;em&gt;H. erectus &lt;/em&gt;used the implement are unclear, Pante and his colleagues say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This find and four of the other bone implements date to at least 800,000 years ago, based on their original positions below Olduvai sediment that records a known reversal of Earth’s magnetic field about 781,000 years ago. Another bone artifact dates to roughly 1.7 million years ago, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Olduvai point implicates &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; as the inventor of barbed bone point technology,” Pante says, because stone tools previously excavated in the same Olduvai Gorge sediment resemble those that have been found at other African sites with &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; fossils.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bone tools described in the new study come from a collection of animal bones excavated in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Mary Leakey before being stored among thousands of fossils and artifacts at an on-site Olduvai facility. Pante discovered the set of 52 bones in 2007 while doing research at Olduvai Gorge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, archaeologist Christian Tryon of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, who did not participate in the new study, questions whether the Olduvai bone specimen can be definitively classed as a barbed bone point because it wasn’t finished. But Pante’s report shows that Olduvai hominids, whether they were &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; or some other prehuman population, carefully selected bones as well as stones for toolmaking, Tryon says. “They were expert craftsmen or women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York University archaeologist Justin Pargeter agrees. Although it’s unclear whether the Olduvai artifact was a pointed bone tool comparable to those later made by &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, he says, the existence of any bone toolmaking 800,000 years ago shows that this practice is far older than typically assumed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with bone toolmaking, a series of critical behavioral advances in hominids occurred before the emergence of &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; around 300,000 years ago. These developments include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested&quot;&gt;the invention of stone tools&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/3/19&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire&quot;&gt;controlled fire use&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/12&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-homo-stone-tools-north-africa-arabia-early&quot;&gt;the ability to survive in new environments&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/29/18&lt;/em&gt;). Exploiting bone to make tools such as barbed points would have aided ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; groups migrating through unfamiliar regions where locations of stone sources were unknown, Pante suspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jewelry making, cave painting and other symbolic acts may represent “modern human behaviors” that eluded earlier hominids such as &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, Pante says. But some researchers suspect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestors-engraved-abstract-patterns&quot;&gt;now-extinct &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species also created symbolic items &lt;/a&gt;(&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/3/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: How environmental changes may have helped make ancient humans more adaptable</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092497</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/environmental-changes-stone-age-humans-adaptable</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An unforgiving environmental twist deserves at least some credit for the behavioral flexibility that has characterized the human species since our African origins around 300,000 years ago, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years in parts of East Africa, food and water supplies remained fairly stable. But new evidence shows that starting about 400,000 years ago, hominids and other ancient animals in the region faced a harsh environmental reckoning, says a team led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The climate began to fluctuate dramatically. Faults caused by volcanic eruptions fractured the landscape and reduced the size of lakes. Large animals died out and were replaced by smaller creatures with more diverse diets. These changes heralded &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/43/eabc8975&quot;&gt;a series of booms and busts&lt;/a&gt; in the resources hominids needed to survive, Potts and his colleagues report October 21 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around that time, hominids at a site called Olorgesailie in what’s now Kenya transformed their culture. That shift, between around 500,000 and 320,000 years ago, was probably influenced by increasingly unpredictable periods of water and food scarcity, the scientists contend.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Stone hand axes and other cutting tools made of local stone had dominated African toolkits for 700,000 years before that transition occurred. After that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-climate-shifts-may-have-sparked-human-ingenuity-and-networking&quot;&gt;Middle Stone Age tools, such as spearpoints&lt;/a&gt; made from rock imported from distant sources, gained popularity, Potts’ team has previously found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/15/18&lt;/em&gt;). Middle Stone Age tools were smaller and more carefully crafted implements. Widely scattered hominid groups began to trade with one another to obtain suitable toolmaking rock and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Potts has long argued that Olorgesailie hominids evolved genetically and behaviorally to handle frequent climate shifts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/humanitys-imprecision-vision&quot;&gt;a process dubbed variability selection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/12/97&lt;/em&gt;). But the new study indicates that ancient humans adapted to a number of environmental forces, not just climate fluctuations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A cascade of ancient ecological changes led to alternating periods of resource abundance and scarcity, likely helping to make us the most adaptable [hominid] species that ever existed,” Potts says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erosion at Olorgesailie has destroyed sediment layers dating to the Middle Stone Age transition. So the researchers hired a Kenyan company to drill as deeply as possible in the Koora basin, located about 24 kilometers south of Olorgesailie. Dating of the 139-meter-long extracted core found that the sediments spanned much of the last 1 million years, making it the best environmental record of that time period for anywhere in Africa, Potts says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photographs of sediment cores&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092499&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102120_BB_ancient-enviro_inline_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092499&quot;&gt;A segment of an East African sediment core (bottom) includes signatures of volcanic blasts, dry and rainy seasons, and changes in land cover (all shown in the top close-ups).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092499&quot;&gt;Human Origins Program/Smithsonian, core image courtesy of LacCore/Univ. of Minnesota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chemical and microscopic studies of the core revealed signs of volcanic eruptions having created faults that fragmented the Olorgesailie landscape starting roughly 400,000 years ago. Small ponds and lakes then replaced larger lake basins at a time when rainfall became inconsistent. Intermittent, increasingly frequent dry periods resulted in severe water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetation changes followed. Shifts back and forth from grassy plains to forests denied large animals, such as elephants, regular access to former grazing areas. Faults in the landscape also reduced the size of any available grazing areas. As Potts’ team has previously found, smaller animals with diverse diets, including antelopes and pigs, became prominent at Olorgesailie during the Middle Stone Age. Stone tools at that time may have been tailored for hunting and processing smaller prey, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Booms and busts in resource availability during the Middle Stone Age each generally lasted for a few thousand years, based on evidence from the Koora sediment core, Potts says. That time resolution is a big improvement over previous studies that used global climate data to reconstruct ancient African environmental changes that occurred over tens of thousands of years, says archaeologist and paleoanthropologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen in Germany, who did not participate in the new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pott and colleagues’ findings “provide the best evidence yet for a link between environmental changes in East Africa and the spread of Middle Stone Age technology and increased mobility across the landscape,” says paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. Although it’s still unclear where in Africa — as well as when and by whom — Middle Stone Age tools were invented, early humans would have found such implements invaluable for adapting to environmental disruptions, Stringer says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olorgesailie’s Middle Stone Age boom-and-bust scenario may not apply to other parts of Africa where spearpoints and related implements didn’t appear until later, cautions archaeologist Lyn Wadley of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. In those settings, Middle Stone Age tools may have proven useful even for groups that enjoyed relatively stable water and food sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science News: NASA’s OSIRIS-REx survived its risky mission to grab a piece of an asteroid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092491</guid>
	<link>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is a cosmic rock collector. Cheers erupted from mission control at 6:12 p.m. EDT on October 20 as scientists on Earth got word that the spacecraft had gently nudged a near-Earth asteroid called Bennu, and grabbed some of its rocks to return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The spacecraft did everything it was supposed to do,” said mission principal investigator Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson on October 20 on a NASA TV webcast. “I can’t believe we actually pulled this off.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx arrived at Bennu in December 2018, and spent almost two years making detailed maps of the 500-meter-wide asteroid’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-bennu-brittle-boulders-easier-sample-collection-nasa&quot;&gt;surface features and composition&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/8/20&lt;/em&gt;). Observations from Earth suggested Bennu should be smooth and sandy, but when OSIRIS-REx arrived, it found a treacherous, rocky landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team selected a relatively smooth patch in a crater named Nightingale. The spot was not without hazards, though — the team was so worried about a particularly large rock nearby that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-has-picked-osiris-rex-landing-site-asteroid-bennu&quot;&gt;they named it “Mount Doom”&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/12/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the spacecraft did not need to fully land in the crater to complete its mission. As it hovered just above the surface, OSIRIS-REx reached out a robotic arm with an instrument called TAGSAM at the end, for Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism. The instrument tapped the asteroid lightly for six seconds, and released a burst of nitrogen gas to disturb the surface dust and pebbles. Once those small rocks were lofted, some were blown into the sample collector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OSIRIS-REx grabs a Bennu sample&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092501&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102120_LG_osiris-rex_inline.gif&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092501&quot;&gt;This gif is made from images that NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft took as it descended toward asteroid Bennu on October 20, tapped the asteroid to collect a sample of dust and small rocks, and lifted off again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092501&quot;&gt;Goddard/NASA, University of Arizona&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team stayed up late analyzing the spacecraft’s pictures of the sampling sequence, Lauretta said in a news conference on October 21. Based on those images, it looked like the head of sampling device pushed down into the dust of Bennu’s surface a bit. That’s good news, Lauretta said. In experiments performed on Earth, the spacecraft grabbed the most rock when the sampling head was surrounded by dust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also looks like the spacecraft destroyed a relatively large rock on its descent. “Literally, we crushed it,” Lauretta said. “That rock appears to fragment and shatter.” Studying the asteroid from orbit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-bennu-brittle-boulders-easier-sample-collection-nasa%5d&quot;&gt;suggested that type of smashing was possible&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/8/20&lt;/em&gt;), the team reported on October 8, and it was exciting to see it actually happen, Lauretta said in the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because signals from Earth took 18½ minutes to reach Bennu, the spacecraft performed the sampling sequence autonomously. When the mission team got the signal that the spacecraft had finished its job and retreated to a safe distance from Bennu, team members pumped their arms in the air, cheered and sent each other socially distant high-fives and hugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx is not the first spacecraft to grab samples from an asteroid. That distinction goes to Japan’s Hayabusa mission, which brought back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/hayabusa-asteroid-sample-return-mission-lands-australia&quot;&gt;grains of asteroid Itokawa in 2010&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/14/10&lt;/em&gt;). An encore to that mission, Hayabusa2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-spacecraft-first-sample-asteroid-dust&quot;&gt;collected samples of asteroid Ryugu&lt;/a&gt; last year, and is on track to land in Australia in December (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But OSIRIS-REx has collected much more material than Hayabusa2 did. Hayabusa2 hoped to collect 100 milligrams, although Hayabusa2’s scientists have no way to know how much material it actually collected until the spacecraft returns to Earth. OSIRIS-REx aimed for a minimum of 60 grams, or a little more than two ounces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images that the spacecraft took of itself first suggested that OSIRIS-REx easily cleared that bar, snagging an estimated 400 grams, or 14 ounces. The sample collector was so full of rock and dust that small asteroid particles were escaping into space, the team reported on October 23. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, on October 29, the team announced that they actually think the collector was full to capacity when it pulled away from Bennu, which means it carried about two kilograms of material. “Imagine a sack of flour at the grocery store, that’s what we were pulling away from the surface with,” Lauretta said in a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some tens of grams of rock and dust escaped as the spacecraft moved the collector and stowed it safely in the capsule that will bring it back to Earth. While the part of the collector that was visible to the spacecraft’s cameras probably holds about 400 grams, that’s only 17 percent of the collector’s whole volume. “We’re probably pretty close to in excess of a kilogram of material,” Lauretta said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally, the spacecraft was supposed to extend its arm and spin its whole body. The difference in the way it spun after the sample collection, versus before, would have revealed the mass of the sample. But the team cancelled that plan, fearing that the motion would send more asteroid dust flying into space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the team decides to go back for a second sample, the spacecraft won’t return to Nightingale crater, said project manager Rich Burns of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., at the October 21 news conference. Any second attempt would touch down in a backup site called Osprey, and would happen in January.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx will return to Earth in 2023, where scientists will analyze the rocks in hopes of unlocking details of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-sample-missions-hayabusa2-ryugu-osiris-rex-bennu&quot;&gt;history of the solar system&lt;/a&gt; and the origins of water and life on Earth (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People From Japan May Be Less Prone Than Americans To Some Of The Harmful Health-Related Effects Of Negative Emotions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40593</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/21/people-from-japan-may-be-less-prone-than-americans-to-some-of-the-harmful-health-related-effects-of-negative-emotions/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s your view on feelings of sadness, nervousness or hopelessness? Are they harmful emotions that we should strive to avoid feeling — an opinion that is widely held in the West? Or is natural, even helpful, to feel them from time to time — a perspective commonly found in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that cultural attitudes to our emotions affect our health. In Japan, for example, greater reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/22/cross-cultural-correction-for-people-in-japan-happiness-isnt-associated-with-better-health/&quot;&gt;happiness isn’t associated with better health&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to findings from the US. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/&quot;&gt;regular experience of high-energy, high-arousal states is associated with better health in the US, but not Japan&lt;/a&gt;, where calm, quiet states are highly valued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; reveals that our attitudes to negative emotions, such as sadness and hopelessness, matter, too. Previous studies have linked experience of these emotions to increased inflammation and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and even death among Americans, but not Japanese people. So Jiyoung Park at the University of Texas at Dallas and her colleagues set out to explore whether differences in stress might explain this. If, in contrast to Japanese people, Americans view the experience of negative emotions as a failure of self-control, and feel stress as a result, this could explain the links between these kinds of emotions and poorer health. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40593&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The team analysed detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midus.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;data collected on 761 Americans&lt;/a&gt; of European descent and &lt;a href=&quot;http://midus.wisc.edu/midja/index.php&quot;&gt;328 Japanese adults&lt;/a&gt;, with a mean age of about 60. As part of much bigger studies, these participants had all completed surveys to assess negative emotions (how often, and how severely, they felt them) and personality. They had also given a series of saliva samples, which had been analysed for levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and blood samples, which had been checked for certain markers of inflammation as well as cholesterol levels (which can indicate risk for cardiovascular disease). Their blood pressure had also been checked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthy people show a big spike in cortisol shortly after waking, then a gradual decline in levels of this hormone during the day. Regular stress alters this pattern, blunting that early spike and making the decline less steep — a profile known to be associated with poorer health. When the team analysed the data, they found that experience of negative emotions was indeed associated with a flattening of the daily cortisol slope among the Americans, but not among the Japanese participants. (The team took all kinds of other factors into account when performing the analysis, including personality traits known to influence the reporting of negative emotions, gender, age, sleep patterns and more.) This was the case even though the Japanese participants in fact reported more negative emotions than the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Park and her colleagues also found that for the Americans, but not the Japanese participants, experience of negative emotions was associated with both more inflammation and higher cardiovascular risk indicators. Their analysis led them to conclude that this was due to the flattening of the cortisol slope among only the Americans. “These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese participants appeared to be “buffered against some of the harmful health consequences of negative affect because of their view of negative affect as a fluctuating, momentary part of a natural cycle of both the self and external events, and thus not threatening or stressful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers themselves note, there are, however, a few reasons to be cautious about drawing very strong conclusions from this data. The links that they report are all correlational, and longitudinal studies will be needed to look at variations in negative emotion, cortisol profile and health over time. Also, it’s possible that something other than differences in attitudes to negative emotion — differences in emotion regulation abilities, perhaps — are behind the different findings for Americans versus Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the research does add to a growing body of evidence that our &lt;em&gt;attitudes&lt;/em&gt; to our emotions are key to understanding how they affect our long-term health. It could be tricky to change the view, widespread in the West, of negative emotions as being undesirable, even dangerous. But this work, in the context of other recent supporting studies, certainly suggests that it is worth trying to do this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;Feeling bad is not always unhealthy: Culture moderates the link between negative affect and diurnal cortisol profiles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Contact tracing through friendship groups identifies additional syphilis and gonorrhea cases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12131</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/10/21/contact-tracing-through-friendship-groups-identifies-additional-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-cases/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/people-3755342_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact tracing for disease control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syphilis and gonorrhea incidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report.html&quot;&gt;have increased enormously&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades, necessitating innovative approaches. The rising prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea, together with the increase in prevalence of resistant gonorrhea, makes contact tracing an important tool for disease control. In connection with the opioid epidemic, syphilis is now common in rural areas. However, people infected with stigmatized diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea may be reluctant to reveal all of their sexual contacts. Reasons for not revealing all contacts may include internalized stigma, cognitive dissonance, or beliefs that certain types of sexual contacts do not “count.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for friends might identify more sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases because friends may participate within the same sexual network, or some friends might be non-romantic sexual partners. One survey even found 77% of Grindr users report looking for friendship, more than the percentage seeking dating (67%), one-on-one sex (62%), or group sex (17%).&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09589-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who were diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea in Baltimore City STI clinics were asked to name the most important people in their lives, with questions such as whom they eat meals with, who would take them to medical appointments, who would go to the store for them, or lend them $25. After patients named their friends and social contacts, they were asked to name their sexual contacts. Both social and sexual contacts were invited to the STI clinic for testing, and to name their own social and sexual contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this information for patients whose contacts visited the STI clinic, we created a network showing the friendship and sexual contacts and the STI test results.  We identified new cases of both syphilis and gonorrhea within each network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12132&quot; style=&quot;width: 307px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12132 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-1-297x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;297&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of syphilis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, the network shows new cases of syphilis identified by asking for social contacts in the large red squares.The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for syphilis. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections. Biological strain analysis for the organism that causes syphilis (&lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt;) found that the disease strains matched across connected individuals, suggesting that individuals were connected within the same sexual network, although not necessarily directly: the friends may have had sex together or have a sex partner in common that does not appear in the graph. It’s remarkable here that for many pairs where both were infected with syphilis (syphilis-concordant dyads, for short), no sexual partners appear in the graph, and in a few cases both are male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12133&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12133&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-2-300x297.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of gonorrhea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did the same for gonorrhea.  As before, new cases of gonorrhea identified by asking for social contacts are the large red squares. The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for gonorrhea. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional cases of syphilis and gonorrhea identified by asking friendship ties suggest that they under-reported their sexual contacts. These friendship ties may actually be sexual ties that were not reported as sexual; many of these ties were same-sex, and same-sex ties were stigmatized in this community, especially at the time that the data were collected (2001-05). Alternatively, these friendship ties may represent participation in the same sexual networks, such as engaging in a sexual relationship with the same person or people, who were not observed in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given existing strains on public health resources, public health policy must be creative. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by Disease Intervention Specialists. However, the 2008 recession resulted in large cuts to public health agencies that were never reversed. The Disease Intervention Specialists currently do not have enough resources even to contact all sexual contacts of index cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, so they prioritize vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. Public health agencies simply do not have resources to contact the friends of index cases, and index cases may not cooperate anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, large technology companies have created privacy-preserving innovations in SARS-coronavirus-2 contact tracing &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; that have been deployed in state health department contact tracing apps. These contact tracing protocols identify nearby phones using Bluetooth and approximate the distance and duration. Public health authorities create COVID-19 contact tracing apps using these protocols that can specify distance and time duration for potential coronavirus contacts. These protocols or health department apps could be extended to contact tracing for other diseases. Changing the parameters for distance and duration on public health contact tracing apps could identify potential sexual contacts, allowing these apps to be used for STI contact tracing. The transition to these COVID-19 contact tracing apps has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/why-contact-tracing-apps-not-slowed-covid-us/&quot;&gt;bumpy&lt;/a&gt;, with technological limitations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-to-get-people-to-actually-use-contact-tracing-apps&quot;&gt;low uptake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://devops.com/more-than-half-of-americans-willing-to-participate-in-contact-tracing-but-have-major-privacy-concerns/&quot;&gt;lack of public trust&lt;/a&gt;, especially in government. The Bluetooth distance detection doesn’t do well &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/contact-tracing-apps-struggle-to-be-both-effective-and-private&quot;&gt;near shiny surfaces or in public transit buses or trains&lt;/a&gt;, and while that’s a large problem for COVID-19 contact tracing, it’s not a problem for STIs. As with many US problems, low public trust in government is the limiting factor for contact tracing, whether traditional or by app.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS and Transparency  (including Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18494</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/rgrxzk9cwSw/</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a non-profit, mission-driven organization PLOS abides by our commitment to transparency. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;openly share&lt;/a&gt; information and context about our finances, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;target revenue amounts&lt;/a&gt; in some of our emerging business models. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt; provided us — and other publishers — a clear, uniform structure to share information about the services we perform and a percentage breakdown of how these are covered by the prices we charge. Many of our mission-driven publishing activities go well beyond peer review and production services. We provide commentary on some of these services, including how the varied editorial setups of our journals contribute to different percentage price breakdowns per title. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data via such frameworks. And, we remain confident in showcasing how our prices cover our reasonable costs for a high level of service, with some margin for reinvestment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since our founding in 2001, PLOS has maintained a firm commitment to transparency. Transparency informs our work within communities. It drives our approach to open science practices &amp;amp; policies. And it underpins our willingness to share financial data. Here are three examples of our commitment in action:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every year we provide financial transparency via the publication and contextualization of our IRS filings (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;2018 financial overview available here; &lt;/a&gt;our 2019 overview will be available in November)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We participate in broader efforts within the publishing community to encourage greater understanding around pricing and the costs of Open Access publishing (see immediately below for the Plan S example)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our new collective action business model for &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; — openly shares how much revenue is required for PLOS to run these specific journals. We will redistribute revenues beyond the target back to community members&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, we are especially grateful to cOAlition S for spurring the scholarly publishing community, broadly, to engage with transparency via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Response to Plan S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, PLOS (together with nine other publishers&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informationpower.co.uk/launch-of-the-plan-s-price-transparency-framework/&quot;&gt;piloted &lt;/a&gt;one of the two approved pricing transparency frameworks for cOAlition S. We are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;sharing the figures PLOS provided&lt;/a&gt; as part of this initiative to provide context to our own pricing and to further promote this kind of transparency broadly within the community. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data as well. (Please see the post on price transparency by our friends at &lt;strong&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.f1000.com/2020/08/19/price-transparency-on-f1000research/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into discussion of figures, we want to restate two underlying principles.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS does not charge for any activity for the sole purpose of profit. We do not seek or need revenue surplus for return to shareholders, but rather to support and reinvest in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our organizational activities are developed to meet the needs of researchers, our prices cover our reasonable costs for our high level of service plus some margin for reinvestment, and our drives for efficiency are to enable as good an author experience as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency framework invited publishers to divide Article Processing Charge, per journal, into seven categories of activity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal and community development&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;efforts&lt;/strong&gt;, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission to desk reject or acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer review management &lt;/strong&gt;by staff/remunerated people, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance to publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services after publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales &amp;amp; marketing&lt;/strong&gt; to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author and customer support,&lt;/strong&gt; including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ pricing breakdown (which is only one element of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;data captured in the spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;) for 2019 is presented in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;APC price&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,595&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for journal and community development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price from submission to desk reject or accept&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for peer review management&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;23%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services from acceptance to publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services after publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for sales &amp;amp; marketing to customers or of articles&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for author and customer support&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is a relatively good way of illustrating the breadth of activities that occur at PLOS, and which our income supports. However, like any framework or metric, it strips away some of the detail and nuance so we wanted to provide some overarching commentary and highlight a few observations.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varied Editorial structures drive varied price allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, PLOS has two types of editorial setup across our seven journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; are supported by senior &lt;strong&gt;in-house&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;editorial teams&lt;/strong&gt; (including Editors-in-Chief, an Executive Editor, Senior Editors, and Associate Editors) working in conjunction with external editorial boards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt; each have &lt;strong&gt;external &lt;/strong&gt;Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors (who are full time members of the research, medical, health, and/or academic communities).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The in-house editorial teams (a.k.a. Staff Editors) comprise salaried PLOS employees and are editorially independent. We see this combined expertise of dedicated Staff Editors and leading scientists in the field as an important aspect of the publication process for these titles. Our Staff Editors work to guide researchers through submission and peer review. They also partner with our external Academic Editors, experts in the field, to provide guidance. This unique editorial model ensures expertise, fairness and efficiency for each manuscript. This internal and external resourcing structure is reflected in the greater price share for activities related to “initial triage” and “peer review management” for these particular titles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond editorial and production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 43% – 61% of our journals’ price covers the editorial/production work of receiving submissions, coordinating their peer review, and production and online publication of accepted articles. The remainder of the price covers the broader and deeper work of services before and after the publication process, including marketing, author support, and ethics checks, among other things — each of which is critically important. As examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a highly regarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics&quot;&gt;publishing ethics team&lt;/a&gt; that handles all  ethical and scientific concerns involving submissions and published articles. It also works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards, develops policies and processes to address integrity issues (at scale) prior to publication, and participates in broader discussions about publication ethics policies and practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS engages closely with research communities (e.g. by attending/organizing conferences/events/workshops, these days mostly online) to ensure the journals and their policies truly reflect the research interests and values of these fields and communities. We operate in both global and local contexts, therefore it is ever more important to ensure we reflect the values of the diverse communities of researchers whom we publish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a dedicated, proactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/media/&quot;&gt;media team&lt;/a&gt; that collaborates with authors, institutions, science media centers and journalists to communicate research to both scientists and society. Consequently, articles published in our journals receive great attention in the media. The team also develops policies and participates in industry conversations about best practices (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/preprints-and-the-media-a-change-to-how-plos-handles-press-for-papers-previously-posted-as-preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints and the media&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS’ Outreach team promotes articles, invites submissions, promotes initiatives like calls for papers, and has also created widely used and well-regarded resources such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/&quot;&gt;Peer Review Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/&quot;&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS pilots, develops, and leads the way in &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/&quot;&gt;Open Science practices&lt;/a&gt;, from creating new software to be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/&quot;&gt;publish peer review histories at scale&lt;/a&gt;, to patiently cultivating trust in science via a rigorous approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;preprints and preprint commenting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;constantly working&lt;/a&gt; to make Open Access easier, more efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines. This is both via &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;new business model&lt;/a&gt; development, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Open-Access-RFI-Comments-Reduced-5.pdf&quot;&gt;policy engagement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We hope the full data and above commentary can give you some new insights. At PLOS we are proud of what we do. It is our privilege to devote our time and energy towards such crucial matters as increasing trust in science. We will always do this in partnership with the research community. And, perhaps, there has never been a more important time to be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: After Cheating On A Test, People Claim To Have Known The Answers Anyway</title>

	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/20/after-cheating-on-a-test-people-claim-to-have-known-the-answers-anyway/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheating is common, ranging from benign instances like looking up an answer on your phone during a pub quiz, to the fairly major, such as using a series of coughs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBWR0I9LbOQ&quot;&gt;fraudulently bag yourself a million pounds &lt;/a&gt;on a popular TV game show. But wherever we fall on that scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10463280802613866&quot;&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still likely to think of ourselves as honest and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s something of a tension here — we’re seemingly both prone to cheating &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; convinced of our own integrity. Matthew L. Stanley and colleagues from Duke University have one explanation for this apparent contradiction &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-020-01812-w&quot;&gt;in their latest paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychonomic Bulletin &amp;amp; Review&lt;/em&gt;: when we cheat, we claim we knew the answers all along.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40582&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before the start of the study proper, the team conducted a pilot test with 95 participants, who were shown 24 general knowledge questions; half were easy (“how many legs does a spider have?”) while the other half were more difficult (“Which nation was the first to ratify the United Nations charter in 1945?”). No participants correctly answered any of the 12 difficult questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 147 participants saw these 24 questions and had to type in the answers. Before answering, they were told the correct answer would be visible to them, upside down in a small font on the bottom right of their screens. Looking at the answer, they were told, as well as looking things up online, was considered cheating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a short unrelated task, participants were shown the same questions, this time with the answers included. They then indicated whether or not they had known the answer to the question before the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These participants fared better than those in the pilot: they correctly answered 14% of the difficult questions. Given that nobody in the pilot group correctly answered these questions, this suggests that participants were cheating. And when they answered these difficult questions correctly, participants were also more likely to report that they knew the answer all along. That is, even though they likely cheated, they claimed to have known the answer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a second study, participants were assigned to one of two conditions. The first — the cheating condition — replicated the initial study: participants were shown the correct answers on the bottom right hand of their screen. In the control condition, participants had no opportunity to cheat, but were shown the correct solution immediately after answering each question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, those in the cheating condition answered more of the difficult questions than those in the control condition — and were more likely to later report that they knew the answers all along too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, all 412 participants were able to see the answer on their screen — only this time, those in the control condition were told they could look at the answer if they didn’t know it themselves. As in the previous two studies, those in the cheating condition were subsequently more likely to indicate that they knew the answer all along, suggesting yet again a link between perceived (or claimed) knowledge and cheating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings fit into a wider body of research that suggests we’re liable to lie to ourselves about who we are or how we behave. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/6166&quot;&gt;distance ourselves&lt;/a&gt; from past mistakes or &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/45/1/185/4711097?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;forget them&lt;/a&gt; altogether, and see ourselves as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-018-0880-y&quot;&gt;increasingly moral&lt;/a&gt; over time. What the study doesn’t explain is how people are experiencing these mistakes themselves. Are they just lying about having known the answer, fully aware that they’re not telling the truth? Or is there a level of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-deception: do people truly believing that they had the solution all along?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also poses interesting questions about how to prevent cheating. If we’re able to believe we’re honest and trustworthy literally immediately after engaging in duplicitous behaviour, making appeals to morality might not work: people might simply think &lt;em&gt;“I &lt;/em&gt;would never do something like that!” Techniques that completely foreclose the possibility of cheating may have more mileage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-020-01812-w&quot;&gt;Cheaters claim they knew the answers all along&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18477</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/skoQOMC8LYE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the start of Open Access Week 2020 and this year’s theme focuses on “Open with Purpose” with equity and inclusivity as the focal point for the third consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we still talking about this?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this time, the need for international collaboration and access without restrictions is acutely apparent with COVID-19 pausing regular activities, such as conferences, libraries and other in person events. Building equity and inclusivity will create a stronger environment for scientists to ask questions or see problems from a different perspective. It’s also integral for organizations to reflect on what they can do to help researchers from every background get their research to the communities that need it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to an inclusive future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OA helps break down many of the barriers researchers face by sharing their findings to a vast readership. Yet, a number of hurdles still stand between them and the final article. At PLOS, we support researchers at every stage of their career, research and discipline. Open Science further increases transparency and visibility of their work so that all researchers can more easily be recognized for their contributions. With a host of journals and a variety of article types and early sharing methods such as preprints and preregistered reports — researchers will have the opportunity to showcase the full breadth of their findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognize that as an organization we can do much more to assist those in the scientific community that experience challenges due to their gender, race, culture and more. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;blog post by Editorial Director Joerg Heber&lt;/a&gt;, he outlines our support for a diverse and inclusive community and the areas we’ll continue to improve on to recognize and minimize bias, further diversify our leadership and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be counted for your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OA provides the community with the accessibility to your research to see, cite, and share it. Your research and contributions in the community are vital to scientific advancements. Be proud, in whatever stage of your career, of what you’ve achieved and get the recognition for your contributions, be that through your ORCID iD or citations. The OA community is increasingly adapting to the needs of ECRs. Transparency and early sharing practices for every stage of the research process are becoming increasingly common to support researchers in demonstrating their contributions, beyond just publications. Be the first to report your findings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration&lt;/a&gt;, just two ways in which you can highlight your progress early when you’re applying for funding and new positions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS is always searching for new ways we can make publishing and acknowledging your work easier. Whether that means building a more inclusive framework to ensure credit is shared equitably among contributors, or supporting researchers in making their work more visible.  In a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;policy announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, we’re providing better support to transgender authors with live articles published under names that do not reflect their identity. Our staff will be happy to help update your records and help you keep your previous credits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;Implementing name changes for published transgender authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access is more important than ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a time where COVID-19 proves to be a challenging obstacle with restrictions to labs and libraries, it is integral that we’re inclusive of the many groups in the scientific community — researchers around the world need access to content anywhere, anytime. OA is the key to providing fast, public access to research with no restrictions or embargoes. The global benefit of open research is powerful and will help maintain the continuation of scientific advancements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of inclusivity, cost plays a major role in separating researchers from the Open Access journals they would like to publish in. Over this year we’ve made great strides in partnering with institutions and consortia to bridge the gap between cost for prospective PLOS authors. And we’re continuing to experiment with new models that get closer to a truly open to read, open to publish ideal, equitably distributing the costs of publishing so that the burden of payment doesn’t fall on authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps for a fair and diverse future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will continue to improve our processes and endeavour to be advocates for equity and inclusivity in OA and the broader academic community. Beyond 2020, scholarly communication will need to continue the work around creating inclusive environments for researchers by examining the struggles of systemic inequities, acknowledge bias by working with editors and reviewers, and ultimately take action to create a more accessible future for all. More updates to come! &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Rethinking Research Assessment:Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making (part IV)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18475</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one &lt;/a&gt;of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable . In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-iii/&quot;&gt;In part 3&lt;/a&gt; we explored how we gauge value by association. In our final installment we get into how &lt;strong&gt;incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deep legacy traditions held by many academic institutions can be powerful, contributing a sense of continuity and identity and reducing the need to continually reinvent the wheel. But when these organizational habits and norms become too normalized, and old processes and structures persist because “that’s how we’ve always done this,” they can create an unhealthy sense of insularity that excludes new ideas and people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One contributing factor to this is&lt;strong&gt; Confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, which describes peoples’ tendencies to dismiss evidence that doesn’t fit their initial judgments or preconceptions, even if these presumptions are grounded in subjective experiences and limited data. Failing to gather and consider counter-evidence makes us more likely to fall into old ways of thinking, such as cherry-picking information from a CV to confirm the view we already have, or dismissing potential warning signs because a candidate has already been accepted as a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status quo bias&lt;/strong&gt;, sometimes known as “effort aversion,” reflects our tendency to take the path of least resistance unless there are strong reasons not to. This can lead to situations where people stick with recognizably flawed processes because the effort to fix them or adopt new ones is perceived as too much effort. For example, the continued use of citations to indicate research quality is driven in part by the fact that it’s perceived as familiar and easier, not necessarily better, than using alternate indicators of real-world impact. For academic institutions — never known as stealthy and agile entities even in the best of times — this can cause significant paralysis, keeping demonstrably subpar structures in place long past their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the biggest barriers to adopting new behaviors are actually smaller than one might expect, such as not knowing where to start or a lack of clarity about the value of doing things differently. Making the benefits of new behaviors concrete, salient, and simple to grasp makes both starting and follow-through easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question what you “know.”&lt;/strong&gt; Sticking with old assumptions tends to reward those with more traditional backgrounds, which comes at the expense of attracting new or more diverse talent. Productively pushing back on assumptions — even assigning the role of playing devil’s advocate during deliberations — can force all involved to be crisper and more defined about what qualities matter, and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden notions of success.&lt;/strong&gt; New processes can only go so far if definitions for success (and who’s invited to the table) aren’t also revisited. Setting, publicizing, and adhering to goals that look beyond traditional norms or value alternate experiences can broaden the diversity of individuals under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incumbent systems, processes, and structures are inherently advantaged, partly due to familiarity and partly because our tendency toward effort aversion tells us it’s almost always easier to stick with the old, however flawed, than introduce something new. This is especially true when those in positions of seniority have benefited from these legacy systems as their careers have progressed, and when in many cases entire academic careers spent at an individual institution may mean limited insight into even &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do things differently. But the need to introduce more equitable decision-making into RPT decisions to increase the presence of minoritized candidates, researchers, and faculty is very real, and will not happen without a combination of serious intent and structural support. Without active intervention, one model of current post-doc to faculty transitions has indicated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not otherwise significantly increase until 2080&lt;/a&gt;. This is too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. Available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Giving Week: Why arXiv?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=735</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Four million monthly users. 1.7 million articles. More than one billion downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are clear: arXiv is a critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what these numbers don’t reveal? The impact arXiv has had on individual people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement of a grad student posting their first article. The junior faculty member who just earned tenure, thanks to research originally shared on arXiv. The productive researcher whose library cannot afford to subscribe to all the right journals. The weekly research group meeting to discuss the most recent arXiv papers. The interdisciplinary collaboration sparked by an arXiv submission. The machine learning enthusiast who tinkers with the arXiv dataset, future discoveries yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“arXiv is like air.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of an arXiv-er. In other words, arXiv is free, totally necessary, and easy to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But arXiv is not free to produce, which is why we’re asking you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=22315&amp;amp;cid=35778&amp;amp;dids=276&amp;amp;bledit=1&amp;amp;sort=1&quot;&gt;join arXiv’s community of supporters with a donation&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;strong&gt;International Open Access Week&lt;/strong&gt;, from October 19th through the 23rd. We urge you to consider recurring payments in any amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from voluntary contributions from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and &lt;strong&gt;individuals like you&lt;/strong&gt;. Your contribution will help ensure that arXiv remains &lt;strong&gt;a non-commercial, community resource.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=22315&amp;amp;cid=35778&amp;amp;dids=276&amp;amp;bledit=1&amp;amp;sort=1?source=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Donate Button&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-738&quot; height=&quot;58&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Donate-Button.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: “Awe Walks” Can Boost Positive Emotions Among Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40572</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/19/awe-walks-can-boost-positive-emotions-among-older-adults/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the age of about 75, people tend to feel more anxiety, sadness and loneliness, and less in the way of positive emotion. Strategies to prevent or at least counteract these deteriorations are badly needed, and new &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69974-001&quot;&gt;research by a team in the US&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, has now identified one apparently promising strategy: so-called “awe walks”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40572&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As Virginia Strum at the University of California and her colleagues note, awe is a positive emotion felt by people “when they are in the presence of something vast that they cannot immediately understand”. A walk through a desert, a beautiful piece of art, a wedding — all of these things, and more, can lead to feelings of awe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier work shows that when we feel awe, our focus shifts from our self to the wider world, leading us to perceive ourselves as being less significant, or “smaller”, and also making us feel more socially connected to our community. This could lead to a rise in positive, prosocial emotions, the team reasoned — and might help to combat typical age-related increases in negative emotions and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To investigate the potential of their awe walk idea, the team recruited 52 healthy adults aged 60 to 90, half of whom formed a control group. Both groups were told to take a 15 minute outdoor walk, ideally alone, every week for eight weeks, and to take three photographs of themselves each time — one before, one during and one after the walk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only the awe group was told that “with the right outlook, awe can be found almost anywhere, but it is most likely to occur in places that involve two key features: physical vastness and novelty”. This group were asked to tap into their “sense of wonder” and to try to go somewhere new each week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants completed a battery of surveys before, during and after their walk programmes. And the team found some key differences between the two groups. Firstly, as the researchers had predicted, the awe group reported feeling more awe while walking. Over time, they also felt more socially connected, and reported bigger increases in positive emotions — including prosocial emotions such as gratitude and compassion, and also joy — while they were walking. The boost in prosocial emotions, specifically, carried through into everyday life. Daily distress also decreased more over time in the awe group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also analysed the participants’ photographs. They concluded that, with more walks under their belt, the smiles of those in the awe group became more intense. Whether you consider smiles to be expressions of happiness, as the team does, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/02/a-radical-new-theory-proposes-that-facial-expressions-are-not-emotional-displays-but-tools-for-social-influence/&quot;&gt;social signals of a willingness to affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, this could potentially lead to more positive social interactions. Unlike the control group, over time, members of the awe group also came to occupy less physical space, relative to the background, in their selfies. The researchers interpret this as reflecting that the awe group were feeling “smaller” over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the team cautions, most of the participants were White and highly educated, so the results may not generalise to other groups. However, the fact that they were mostly highly educated could be significant in itself. The participants did not complete personality tests. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656600923092&quot;&gt;educational achievement is associated with greater openness to experience&lt;/a&gt;, a personality trait that entails enjoying new things. If the awe group were particularly open to experience then presumably they enjoyed the novelty of walking somewhere new each time, and this may have led to an increase in positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What about the finding that, over time, the awe group took up less space in their selfies? Again, they were told to try to walk somewhere new each time — and that vast spaces are more likely to trigger awe. It certainly seems possible that, with growing confidence, they chose to travel to renowned beauty spots, rather than a local park, say, and selfies at those beauty spots may be more likely to contain large background features such as a mountain (which features in the paper as an example of a “big background” constituent of one awe group selfie).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasons behind the findings, the work does suggest that — for highly educated, healthy older people, at least — “awe walks” are beneficial. And, despite the potential risks associated with encouraging older people to walk alone in vast, unfamiliar natural settings, there could clearly be physical health benefits, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69974-001&quot;&gt;Big smile, small self: Awe walks promote prosocial positive emotions in older adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, researchers have looked at what happens in the brain when people take the psychedelic drug salvinorin A, from the plant &lt;em&gt;salvia divinorum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;The team found that the drug disrupts the default mode network, a set of areas that are normally synchronised when we’re not engaged in any particular task, similar to the effects found for the “classical” psychedelic drugs like psilocybin. But the &lt;em&gt;subjective &lt;/em&gt;effects of salvinorin A are quite different to the effects of those other drugs, leaving some researchers questioning how important the default mode network really is to the psychedelic experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-my-brain-on-salvia/&quot;&gt;Daniel Oberhaus, who participated in the trial, has the story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40561&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study in the 1980s claimed that married couples begin to look more alike over time — but now a larger replication has failed to find any evidence that that is true. &lt;/strong&gt;Instead the new study suggests that people tend to partner up with those who already look similar to them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/12/researchers-crack-question-of-whether-couples-start-looking-alike&quot;&gt;reports Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s been more than a decade since the replication crisis became a well-known issue in psychology, and in science more generally. So has anything changed? &lt;/strong&gt;Not a lot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics&quot;&gt;writes Kelsey Piper&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox, &lt;/em&gt;although there have been some small victories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How people behave in virtual reality scenarios can provide insight into their personality&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-we-discovered-that-vr-can-profile-your-personality-147949&quot;&gt;writes researcher Stephen Fairclough&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. His team created a VR environment in which participants had to navigate across ice blocks suspended high above the ground. People who took a more risk-averse approach to the task tended to be higher in neuroticism.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many New Yorkers fail to show up to court for low-level offenses &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; so researchers have helped the city redesign its court summons to “nudge” people into attending. &lt;/strong&gt;The tweaks to the form included displaying the key information such as date and court location more prominently, as well as highlighting the consequences of not showing up, and resulted in 13% fewer missed court dates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/new-york-city-uses-nudges-reduce-missed-court-dates&quot;&gt;reports Catherine Matacic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have identified how different types of thirst are encoded in the brain (in mice, at least).&lt;/strong&gt; Different combinations of neurons in a region called the circumventricular organ were active when mice needed pure water, compared to when they needed water and salt (as you might after a sweaty workout). And depending on which set of neurons the researchers later stimulated, mice chose to drink either just water or a mouse “sports drink”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/14/923658129/water-or-a-sports-drink-these-brain-cells-may-decide-which-one-we-crave?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;reports Jon Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there’s more this week on how researchers are analysing the words used on social media to make inferences about the emotional state of the population. &lt;/strong&gt;According to some psychologists, these methods show that our collective mood is pretty low, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/style/self-care/social-media-.html&quot;&gt;writes Casey Schwartz&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; But others say that the language used on Twitter is far from representative of how the general population is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/15/core-recommender-now-supports-article-discovery-on-arxiv/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CORE logo&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-719 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo-300x127.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; readers now have a faster way to find articles relevant to their interests. From an article abstract page, readers can simply activate the CORE Recommender to find additional open access research on similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Recommender, part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; toolset, was developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;CORE&lt;/a&gt;, a global aggregator of open access scientific content, which provides access to millions of full texts. CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way, CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a list of recommended works, the tool utilizes an algorithm based on the article’s full text and metadata, including title, authors, and abstract. The suggestions come both from arXiv and other resources in the CORE collection, and as many as five articles with freely accessible full texts might be recommended. A detailed explanation and discussion of the algorithm, by CORE founder Petr Knoth and his coauthors, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00578&quot;&gt;available on arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recommendations benefit readers, who will access relevant information more quickly, and authors, whose open access content will become more visible to interested readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am very excited about this partnership as arXiv and CORE are both fully embracing the same vision of openness to research for all,” said Petr Knoth, founder and head of CORE. “This partnership will further improve open access infrastructure. It will help arXiv users to discover open access research papers relevant to their work from across the whole network of open access repositories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are happy to welcome CORE to the arXivLabs family,” said arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani, “and we believe the Recommender will help arXiv users discover the content most relevant to their research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and only works with partners that abide by the same principles. Like all third party collaborators, CORE will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: A New Take On The Marshmallow Test: Children Wait Longer For A Treat When Their Reputation Is At Stake</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40544</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/15/a-new-take-on-the-marshmallow-test-children-wait-longer-for-a-treat-when-their-reputation-is-at-stake/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv&quot;&gt;Sofia Deleniv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people — even the non-psychologists among us — have at some point heard of the legendary marshmallow test, which measures the ability of preschool children to wait for a sweet treat. Researchers have found that the amount of time children are willing to wait for their marshmallow is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.54.4.687&quot;&gt;surprisingly predictive of various life outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, such as educational attainment during adolescence, as well as social competence and resilience to stress throughout development. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876169&quot;&gt;recent fMRI brain scan study&lt;/a&gt; even found that people’s performance as kids is related to their ability to suppress their impulses, and is reflected in neurological signatures of cognitive control, 40 years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test is clearly tapping into something crucial that shapes children’s futures to a considerable degree. But what exactly is it? Does the test  capture an ability that is akin to intelligence or intrinsic cognitive control, or might performance be a marker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619839045&quot;&gt;some other underlying factor&lt;/a&gt; — such as the privilege of living in a supportive home where children can develop the trust capacity that enables them to wait for a reward?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of potential explanations is long — and now it has received a surprising new addition from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620939940&quot;&gt;study recently published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fengling Ma from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University and colleagues have discovered that children can radically improve their performance on the marshmallow test if they believe their social reputation might be at stake — an effect that begins to emerge as early as three years of age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40544&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-02138-001&quot;&gt;original experiments&lt;/a&gt;, conducted at Stanford University in the 1970s, preschool-age children were left in a room with a highly desired treat (e.g. a cookie or marshmallow), and a less appealing one — oftentimes a pretzel. They received the following offer: if they could wait for fifteen minutes on their own, they could eat their favourite treat. If the wait became unbearably long, they could always bring back the experimenter. But then they could only have the less exciting snack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Waiting the full fifteen minutes is a challenge, especially if the treats are tauntingly on full display. Children participating in the original experiment waited an average of just over three minutes under these conditions. And the recent study found that waiting was just as difficult for more than 270 three- and four-year-olds from preschools in one Chinese city. In these experiments, children were asked to choose between a single instantaneous reward (a colourful sticker or a cookie), and double the reward if they waited quarter of an hour. Under baseline conditions, fewer than 25% of children had the patience to make it to the end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this figure dramatically changed in two other conditions, where children were made aware of the possibility that their performance might affect their reputation. Here, the experimenter told each child that either their teacher or friend would find out how long they ended up waiting for their reward. This had a radical impact on behaviour: 40% of children waited till the end when they thought their performance would be communicated to a peer, while almost 70% did so when they believed their teacher would find out about their wait.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results are interesting given that the experimenter did not explicitly mention to the children that waiting longer was a desirable behaviour. Instead, kids seemed to understand that patience is a socially valued attribute, and adjusted their behaviour in the hopes of being perceived favourably by other people. The fact that children waited longer when their teacher, as opposed to peer, was their theoretical spectator is intriguing. It implies that children as young as three can make sophisticated judgements about the value of their audience and strategically alter their behaviour to impress them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that a desire for social recognition radically improved children’s performance offers us much food for thought. For years, many researchers have assumed that the key to the marshmallow test’s ability to predict children’s future success lay in its ability to measure their cognitive control. There is, after all, clear value in being able to suppress impulses in favour of more deliberative behaviours. Alternatively, some researchers have argued, the test taps into some other cognitive skill that might have been shaped by a child’s environment. In this debate, largely centred on cognitive abilities, “soft” social skills have perhaps taken a backseat. And yet the new study points at a new, and previously unsuspected, ingredient of good marshmallow test performance: a child’s awareness of the behaviours people value, such as patience, might be just as important. Perhaps it is the marshmallow test’s ability to tap into social perceptiveness that holds the key to this simple test’s ability to predict future success, time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620939940&quot;&gt;Delay of Gratification as Reputation Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Visible Reminders Of Inequality Can Raise Support For Taxing The Wealthy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40535</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of us are aware of the vast inequality that exists in the world — and even if we’re not, exposure to that information can change how we behave. Research has found that we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-27124-015&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more likely to take risks&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to inequality and that it can make high-income individuals &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-21998-002&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less likely to be generous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also change the way people feel about public policy, as Melissa L. Sands and Daniel de Kadt from the University of California, Merced find in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2763-1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature. &lt;/em&gt;They explored real-world inequality in low-income neighbourhoods in South Africa — and found that visible reminders of unequal socioeconomic status can  raise support for taxation of the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40535&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;South Africa, like many other countries, has high levels of inequality, largely related to apartheid and colonialism: World Bank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the top 1% of earners in South Africa own 71% of assets while the bottom 60% own just 7%. The study itself took place in Soweto, an area which has particularly low socioeconomic status both within the country and within its province, Gauteng. The average annual household income in the seven neighbourhoods in which the study took place is 32,000 rand — half the average annual income for Black South Africans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The methods were simple. Participants were approached by a petitioner, who either asked for support for a policy that would redistribute wealth through higher taxation of the wealthy or for a policy related to renewable energy. On some occasions, a BMW 3 Series was placed at the location; on others, the car was absent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants were 9% less likely to stop to sign either petition when the car was nearby. But after controlling for this baseline “suppressive effect”, the team found that  participants were actually 11% &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to sign the wealth tax petition than the renewable energy one in the presence of the BMW. That is, the car, a reminder of inequality, seemed to increase support specifically for the issue of taxation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings strengthen the case of a 2015 survey, also analysed by the team, which also indicated that Soweto residents exposed to more inequality where they lived (e.g. those more likely to see signs of wealth within a kilometre of their home) were more likely to support higher taxation of the wealthy. This wasn’t the case when conspicuous signs of inequality were further away, visible within five or ten kilometres. This all suggests that visible markers of inequality make people more likely to want to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t explore the willingness of participants to engage in other acts of resistance, or the longevity of such actions. As Colin Tredoux and John Dixon point out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02526-8&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this op-ed&lt;/a&gt; about the study, signing a petition is an example of normative resistance — a pretty acceptable way of registering dissent. Whether displays of inequality would spur people onto more active protest would be interesting to explore, as would tracking how such feelings endure over time. And what of those with a higher income themselves? It’s unclear whether the presence of a fancy car would have the same effect on that group — so what might prompt them into supporting social policies that help the many?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further work could also look at the meaning local people ascribe to such displays of inequality. The team notes that Soweto is a site of serious racial stratification — and it’s difficult to untangle issues of race and colonialism from issues of income inequality. Does the car represent racial or class stratification, both or even neither? A follow-up survey may help delve deeper into these issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2763-1&quot;&gt;Local exposure to inequality raises support of people of low wealth for taxing the wealthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: New APC-free Open Access agreements test alternative funding models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18469</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/632z-0lgmGs/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, October 14th at 12:01 Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Jisc, the digital solutions provider for education and research in the UK, and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year Open Access (OA) agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This is the first time that a large university consortium has provided collective agreements as an alternative to APCs at this scale. Jisc and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate OA publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jisc has always been a priority partner, given its high profile, its large existing institutional account base with PLOS, and leadership role in the library community,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “It’s always exciting to partner with a forward-leaning organization whose values and priorities around Open Access and Open Science align with our own. We also look forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18471&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/Jisc-Sq-Logo-2018-RGB-for-Digital.jpg&quot; width=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caren Milloy, Jisc’s director of licensing, adds: “We are pleased to have reached these pioneering agreements with PLOS, which will make it easier for researchers to publish OA and offer affordability and sustainability to institutions. These collective action agreements have the potential to help shape the future of OA funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the flat fee agreement, which begins on January 1, 2021, annual fixed prices will cover uncapped publishing in five PLOS journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; for corresponding authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions as well as custom reporting and collaboration on future reporting standards initiatives. The PLOS Community Action Publishing agreement, facilitates uncapped publishing in PLOS’ two highly selective journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions are eligible. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These agreements empower authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and support a diverse scholarly communication ecosystem for researchers and readers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; PLOS journals include &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS accesses Dimensions on Google Cloud’s BigQuery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18437</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Py94lQGyxhA/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Digital Science and PLOS are pleased to announce an agreement which will provide PLOS, the leading Open Access (OA) publisher with access to Dimensions on BigQuery. Dimensions is a comprehensive database that covers the full research and innovation lifecycle. BigQuery, Google Cloud’s serverless and secure multi-cloud data warehouse, enables PLOS to analyse the full metadata of Dimensions and use it to inform strategy and decision-making across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This follows the recent Digital Science partnership with Google Cloud, which was designed to remove barriers to data access, analysis and visualization for organizations across the research and innovation ecosystem. In today’s environment, stakeholders in the research and innovation ecosystem are seeking to make better, evidence-based decisions. To do this, they need greater access to contextual information, while at the same time protecting the security of their own data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dimensions is a research information platform which has been developed to provide a comprehensive view on the research process and activities  – going beyond publications and citations. While covering 112 million publications with 1.2 billion citations, Dimensions also interlinks data from $1.8 trillion of funded grants, 583,000 clinical trials, 40 million patents, 453k policy documents and 1.5 million datasets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS has been using Dimensions Analytics and the Dimensions API since early 2020, and is also an existing Google BigQuery user. This latest agreement therefore fits seamlessly with PLOS’s own data strategy, providing their staff Dimensions data on Google BigQuery to help shape their business development strategy, monitor trends in the OA landscape — such as providing evidence to support Open Access Transformative Agreements, and create custom dashboards and reports that can be securely accessed and shared across their organization. PLOS will now be able to combine their own internal data with Dimensions external data sources, helping create a 360° view of the research landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kristen Monahan, Data &amp;amp; Insights Senior Manager, said:&lt;em&gt; – &lt;/em&gt;“PLOS already relies on Dimensions for baseline data about institutions and funding to assist in our agreement discussions and uses a combination of Dimensions and internal data for business analytics. Also having access to Dimensions data via Google BigQuery gives us tremendous freedom to analyse and integrate Dimensions data across our organization.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christian Herzog, CEO Dimensions, said: “We’re very pleased that, through this agreement, PLOS staff will get unprecedented access to the Dimensions database. This brings them full flexibility to perform advanced analytics at industry-leading speeds and create personalized dashboards and reports. More importantly, however, it brings them greater access to the contextual information in Dimensions that supports their thoughtful approach to informed, evidence-based decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Community Comments Continued: An update on the preprint commenting pilot at PLOS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18464</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/7U4Cr0nZ0d0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 11 months ago we announced our year-long  &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;preprint commenting pilot&lt;/a&gt; to connect bioRxiv comments on preprints that are under consideration at select PLOS journals to the editors handling those articles. (The journals in the pilot are &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have one month left on this pilot, and in the interest of making the most of this, we also want to hear from YOU, the open science community. Have you ever received public feedback on a preprint? Do you comment on preprints? Privately or publicly? Do you read preprints but feel that you can’t give feedback?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above, we want to hear from you.  Tell us your preprint story &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we anticipated, during this pilot the majority of eligible preprints haven’t received any public comments on the bioRxiv platform. Staff facilitating this pilot have observed that, while some preprints receive high quality feedback in the comments, most do not. Also, the timing of preprint commenting has not always lined up with the peer review process, so that preprints have received detailed feedback after an editorial decision had already been made. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot programs provide an opportunity to take the ongoing temperature of the community regarding innovations in scholarly communication and researcher behaviors. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey reported&lt;/a&gt; that 53% of preprint posters do so in order to receive feedback. So how should we interpret this slow uptake of commenting on the bioRxiv platform?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;328&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VncPSe15Um9uJHUwXTGO6vatdLGU55Qf-3XsfVcyJ2S053HSQ_vIeMXdtPNHFDqhtN58uaGMHWQEOZmUhbF9fYEKBa0wzm_JNhCFJh1OaSf3DZrbewR4KfqVNUHe_U4cs8CpuzxQ&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could easily assume that there just isn’t a lot of interest in preprint commenting. Yet a recent flash survey of reviewers across all the PLOS journals (not just the ones in this pilot) revealed that at least 11% of those surveyed had provided public feedback on a preprint. While a few reported giving private feedback, the majority of respondents told us that they read preprints but don’t comment on them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ASAPbio &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/biopreprints2020-survey-initial-results&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 50% of researchers indicate that the opportunity for early feedback on preprints was very beneficial, suggesting that authors could benefit from preprint commenting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of this pilot we already knew (from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey above&lt;/a&gt;) that researchers have reported a preference for private feedback, and that most researchers who &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;received feedback have received it privately via email or conversation, or, if publicly, via Twitter. Our pilot, which only covered comments left on the bioRxiv platform, had no way of noting whether any comments were actually coming to the authors via other channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we launched this pilot we also talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/why-engage-with-preprints/&quot;&gt;why we engage with preprints&lt;/a&gt;. We see preprints as an important step towards opening up peer review to more voices beyond those expressly invited by the editors. Far from being a side-step around peer review, as some detractors see them, we see preprints as a way of getting &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; eyes, and therefore reviews, on an article undergoing peer review. As our Chief Scientific Officer, Veronique Kiermer, wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;post during Peer Review Week&lt;/a&gt;, preprints maximize and diversify peer review in a way that the traditional process cannot, in a way that complements that traditional process and makes it even stronger. This is all “a celebration of peer review in different forms”!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we remain committed to providing greater opportunities for research communities to participate in reviews of preprints, while promoting transparency in peer review, but we will now consider how we could refine processes around facilitating engagement with preprints during the peer review process. We believe that maximizing and diversifying the voices involved in peer review is simply a behavior we must patiently cultivate, and we will use the lessons learned from the pilot to help us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, please complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;! We have one month of the pilot left to go, and we would like to complement our final report with the findings from this survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, please watch this space for more posts about preprints, peer review, and all the ways in which we’re working with the research community to improve trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Sometimes things get pretty meta around here.  Exhibit A: The journal Current Medical Chemistry has retracted a 2012 paper for plagiarizing from a 2011 article — and the senior authors of each article share the same last name.  Ho hum, you say. But that name is one that might be familiar to RW readers. Here’s … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/13/in-which-a-researcher-named-das-plagiarizes-from-another-researcher-named-das-one-with-20-retractions/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;In which a researcher named Das plagiarizes from another researcher named Das, one with 20 retractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: How Well Do You Know Yourself? Research On Self-Insight, Digested</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40514</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/13/how-well-do-you-know-yourself-research-on-self-insight-digested/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.”&lt;/em&gt; – Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanac, 1750.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Franklin was writing over 250 years ago. Surely we humans have learned strategies since then to aid self-insight — and avoid well-known pitfalls. Most of us are familiar, for example, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/435685/&quot;&gt;better-than-average effect,&lt;/a&gt; the finding that most of us rank ourselves above average at everything from driving ability to desirable personality traits (even though of course we can’t all be right). So armed with this kind of knowledge, are we better placed now to view ourselves accurately? And if not, how can we get better at this — and what benefits can we expect?  The following studies provide some illuminating answers…&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40514&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I’m smarter than other people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The better-than-average effect may be old news, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/&quot;&gt;results from a recent systematic survey of Americans’ beliefs about their own intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (the first to be conducted in 50 years) found that about 70% of men and 60% of women agreed with the statement: “I am more intelligent than the average person.” The team was forced to conclude that Americans’ “self-flattering beliefs about intelligence are alive and well several decades after their discovery was first reported.” Other work has found that our over-estimates of our intelligence can be staggeringly huge — around &lt;em&gt;30&lt;/em&gt; IQ points, on average, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150&quot;&gt;according to a study by Gilles Gignac and Marcin Zajenkowski&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150&quot;&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt; (which also found that we tend to over-estimate our romantic partner’s intelligence even more than our own). The sobering lesson is that you’re probably a lot less smart than you think are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, but I at least know the limits of my knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056?via=ihub&quot;&gt; “Dunning-Kruger effect” &lt;/a&gt;relates specifically to the tendency of people who are poor at a task to over-estimate their ability at it. As David Dunning has written: “The scope of people’s ignorance is often invisible to them.” (Although see Gignac and Zajenkowski again, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y52m6ddb&quot;&gt;paper from this year&lt;/a&gt; arguing that the effect is (mostly) a statistical artefact).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; This over-confidence can be dangerous both to the individual, and to others. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/204605797.pdf&quot;&gt;a US study of student pilots&lt;/a&gt; found that those who’d scored lower on a pilot knowledge test “grossly overestimated their ability” while higher-scoring students tended in fact to under-estimate theirs. The same effect has been noted among other groups such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RP/C7RP00168A#!divAbstract&quot;&gt;chemistry students&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, students who’d scored less than 50% on one exam had predicted that they’d get an average of 69%, while their actual average mark was just under 37%. That’s a massive discrepancy. If you don’t know that you’re under-prepared for a test, this is clearly a problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine. But you can’t deny that I know who I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How well do you know your own personality as it fluctuates from moment to moment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/03/most-of-us-have-some-insight-into-our-personality-traits-but-how-self-aware-are-we-in-the-moment/&quot;&gt;This was explored in a recent study&lt;/a&gt;, which found that participants had self-insight into their momentary levels of extraversion and conscientiousness, but weren’t great at rating how agreeable they were being at any given time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618818476&quot;&gt;As the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;: “This apparent self-ignorance may be partly responsible for interpersonal problems”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to personality in general — your fairly stable, trait levels of extraversion, agreeableness, and so on — there’s some rare good news when it comes to self-insight. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618810000&quot;&gt;a large-scale review of data on self-reports of personality vs personality ratings from others&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, we’re actually pretty good at judging ourselves in this way. In fact, the work revealed that if anything, we’re harsher judges of our personality than other people are. This was a surprise to the researchers, who’d assumed, based on other work in this field, to find a positive self-bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I know what I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you love salt and vinegar crisps, say, but hate cheese and onion, then fair enough. No one’s going to argue that you’re mistaken. But if you tell me you &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; coffee, I might be less accepting. It turns out that it’s not always that easy for us to tell the difference between &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; something and &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/22/heavy-coffee-drinkers-want-coffee-a-lot-more-than-they-actually-like-it/&quot;&gt; A study published this&lt;/a&gt; year found that “heavy” coffee drinkers (people who drank three or more cups a day) actually want coffee a lot more than they like it. The implication is that they drink it mostly or entirely to feed their addiction, rather than for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get better at knowing myself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, the people around you could be more honest: in general, other people don’t help us to correct our biases. Too often, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691613518075&quot;&gt;feedback from employers, family, and friends is vague, and overly positive&lt;/a&gt;, according to research led by Zlatan Krizan at Iowa State University. “As a society, we make the wrong trade-off by thinking that boosting self-esteem is going to boost performance, and that rarely happens,” Krizan says. “That empty praise of telling someone they’re great, or pretending there are not skill differences when there are, can really become a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as seeking honest feedback, and bearing in mind the better-than-average effect, it could also be worth practising humility. Research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity &lt;/em&gt;suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/01/07/some-people-think-they-know-themselves-well-but-do-they-really/&quot;&gt;people who are more modest about their degree of self-knowledge actually know themselves better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it important to have accurate self-knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one likes a narcissist. But there could be some benefits to thinking you’re better than you are. They relate to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912&quot;&gt;optimism bias&lt;/a&gt; — the fact that we tend to over-estimate the likelihood of positive events in our lives, like getting a top promotion, and under-estimate our chances of suffering everything from a divorce to a car crash. Optimism is important for mental and physical health. So perhaps having inflated self-views is important for our wellbeing, too. In fact, according to the results of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0644-0&quot;&gt;study published last year in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this may well be the case. The participants completed various tests of cognitive and emotional abilities and then reported how well they thought they’d done on all these tests. They then spent a week completing daily diaries, in which they reflected on their levels of satisfaction with their career, relationships and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that having accurate self-insight was not related to higher levels of satisfaction in any of these areas. The data even suggested that people who most over-estimated their abilities had the highest levels of life satisfaction. Still, it’s worth noting that feeling great about your life and performing to your highest level are two different things. People with accurate self-knowledge may be more driven to improve, and achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A word of caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Our understanding of the potential pluses or minuses of accurate self-insight is, according to a recent review, “clouded” by all kinds of issues, including differences between studies in the way self-insight is measured, and also fundamental differences in types of self-deception. (Self-deception may sometimes stem from an individual’s desire to defend their self-esteem, but other times exist simply because a person hasn’t really engaged in close self-assessment.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331983635_The_advantages_and_disadvantages_of_self-insight_New_psychological_and_neural_perspectives&quot;&gt;Jennifer Beer and Michelle Harris write&lt;/a&gt; that the currently available research “does not allow us to confidently conclude that self-insight has advantages over some types of self-insight failure (or vice versa).” They conclude by calling for “more systematic investigation of why, when, where and for whom self-insight is costly or beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Implementing name changes for published transgender authors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18453</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ti9zhDfMr0M/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At PLOS we are committed to addressing the needs of all research communities to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. One of the concerns for some of our transgender and non-binary authors is around changes to their names and how these are reflected in the academic record. In particular, the names assigned to transgender or non-binary persons at birth can represent a stigma, and these names are sometimes referred to as deadnames. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although authors can change their name on their ORCiD profiles themselves, changes to their published academic record have been difficult to implement since, traditionally, changes are limited to correcting author or publisher errors. We believe there is no reason for this to be a barrier. Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. Therefore, across all PLOS journals we will now honor requests from transgender and non-binary authors of published papers to update their names. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relevant papers will be “republished”, meaning that they will be fully replaced online, and that their indexing metadata (which affects how the author list appears in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, etc.) should subsequently be updated accordingly. This replaces the author name fully, yet ensures that citation information such as the DOI for the paper remains the same. All previous citations to the paper remain valid. To maintain the author’s privacy, no notice of the name change will be attached to the replaced paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We strive to support our authors and address issues around equality and inclusion, and welcome any enquiries from transgender authors interested in updating names on their past publications. There is no requirement for authors to do so, this is entirely at their discretion. To initiate this process, simply email us at the relevant journal office. What matters to us is the person who authored the paper, and we want to ensure that the published academic record reflects their correct identity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Rethinking Research Assessment: Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making (part III)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18440</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/_MRchp5tKOc/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. Now in part 3 we explore how we gauge value by association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we often give individual data points too much weight, we also face a related, but distinct, tendency to see patterns where they may not exist, or to apply less-than-sound mental models to define the relationships between items. This means that our interpretations of future likelihoods, personal abilities, and relative importance are often skewed, which in turn can impact how we judge risk or prioritize options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the &lt;strong&gt;Halo effect&lt;/strong&gt; also contributes to this tendency, as seen in cases where highly rated or prominent institutions and journals (and individuals associated with them) receive the benefit of the doubt based on reputation. While this associative property can feel like a useful shortcut, it can cause decision-makers to overlook or override important data that should give us pause. For example, noting that an applicant shares one’s alma mater or trained under one’s former mentor might unfairly bolster their reputation based on factors that have little to do with the quality of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another classic behavioraleconomics concept known as&lt;strong&gt; Availability&lt;/strong&gt; is equally relevant. This describes our tendency to fall back on or place a higher weight on anecdotal, top-of-mind, or easily recalled data when making choices. In doing so, availability reduces our power to be fair-minded and equitable, because we end up dismissing other important evidence and missing the bigger picture. Availability can occur when individual or memorable anecdotes are prioritized in academic assessment, like overweighting a single experience or leaning too heavily on someone’s anecdotal recollection to inform a hiring decision. It can also lead to over-valuing recent data, like getting a well-known grant, instead of pursuing a fuller picture of scholarly productivity that would yield a more well-rounded decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured information gathering.&lt;/strong&gt; These tendencies are more likely to occur when there’s no formal mechanism to gather data, increasing the likelihood individual memories or perceptions will dominate judgment and decision-making. The use of structured formats, like interview protocols and narrative format CVs, can keep decision-makers focused on agreed-upon qualities rather than on the vagaries of individual interactions and reflections and also ensure greater consistency of information across candidates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force long-term thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Short-term thinking tends to come more naturally than planning for the future, which means that the attributes we consider important are often more oriented toward immediacy over the longer term. Explicitly articulating and considering longitudinal values and goals, in addition to short-term needs, can help decision-makers concretize the potential outcomes, both pro and con, of decisions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualizing narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional CVs are not known for their ability to demonstrate the big picture. Asking applicants to provide supplemental narratives that highlight and articulate their most meaningful contributions can convert commonly used shortcut characteristics for quality and productivity into more human form. This can re-center the conversation around&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt; research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt;impact&lt;/a&gt; that extends beyond citations and academic circles to include demonstrable real-world change and improved outcomes, and provide concrete definition to otherwise vague terms like “world-class” and “significant contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our final installment next week, we’ll call out how incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. Available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Leaders Can Feel Licensed To Behave Badly When They Have Morally Upstanding Followers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40497</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/12/leaders-can-feel-licensed-to-behave-badly-when-they-have-morally-upstanding-followers/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Countless studies have investigated how a leader’s behaviour influences their followers. There’s been very little work, though, on the reverse: how followers might influence their leaders. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-70962-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology,&lt;/em&gt; helps to plug that gap with an alarming finding: good, morally upstanding followers can create&lt;em&gt; less&lt;/em&gt; ethical leaders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40497&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;M. Ghufran Ahmad at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and colleagues ran a series of studies on participants in an executive training programme at a business school in Pakistan. All were senior or mid-level managers, from a variety of organisations. These, then, were the “leaders”. The people that they managed were the “followers”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, the team found that the more a participant felt that their followers engaged in “organizational citizenship behaviour” (OCB) — such as going out of their way to be “good” to other employees — the more “moral credit” that leader felt they had personally accrued. The concept of moral credit relates to the theory that we each balance good and bad behaviours, to maintain a kind of moral equilibrium. A good deed ups our moral credit, while a bad one depletes that credit. While this phenomenon has been found for individuals, it’s thought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-14075-001&quot;&gt;apply to groups, too&lt;/a&gt;: if one member behaves morally, others can feel licensed to behave less well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran follow-up online studies on fresh batches of participants. These revealed that when a leader was encouraged either to feel more narcissistic (in this case, more responsible for their group’s success) &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;to identify with their followers (by reflecting on characteristics that they shared with their group, for example), they were especially likely to feel that their own moral credit had risen as a result of good behaviour by their followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies all involved experimental manipulations and vignettes, however. And they didn’t tackle the critical question: can vicarious moral credit free leaders to actually behave more badly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get closer to a real-world scenario, the team ran a field study involving 250 managers, all again from the same course. These participants completed four online surveys over two days. They reported on follower OCBs, the extent to which they identified with their followers, their perceived levels of moral credit, levels of narcissism and also any unethical behaviour that they themselves engaged in — such as doing personal business on company time or passing blame for errors to an innocent coworker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that these leaders were indeed more likely to behave badly when they felt themselves to be in moral credit as a result of good behaviour by their subordinates. Tallying with the earlier findings, this effect was especially strong when leaders were narcissistic and/or closely identified with their followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Across multiple studies, our findings indicate that follower OCB can provide leaders with moral credit to engage in subsequent unethical behaviour,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If good teams can foster unethical behaviour among leaders, this insight is relevant to all kinds of organisations, not just businesses. It’s important, too, that leaders who felt closer to the people that they managed were even more susceptible to the effect. As the researchers write: “Our findings provide further support for the notion that close relationships between leaders and followers are not always a good thing”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats. One, the studies were all conducted in Pakistan, which, the team notes, is more collectivistic than the UK or US, for example. Similar studies in other countries will be needed to explore whether these findings hold in more individualistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly much more work is needed to explore the extent to which leaders actually use moral credit to engage in bad deeds in the workplace, or at home, or elsewhere — and over what kind of timescales. Also, what might temper the effect? Are leaders who see themselves as “good people” less susceptible to it, perhaps? And how does each individual’s good or bad behaviour influence the others in the group? If we each have a moral equilibrium, an individual who performs a good deed will surely then feel licensed to behave less well themselves — but does the behaviour of their manager have any impact? There are all sorts of outstanding questions that new studies in this area will hopefully answer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&quot;Even if we be under force and have to return to Galileo times, theories are going theirselves. [...] Describing some subjects for them is similar to speaking of flying with airplane for people around 1000 years ago. I don’t wonder if they kill us for these theories as in Galileo times.&quot; - Massimo Fioranelli, a looney</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to get on a cat’s good side, it’s worth mastering the art of the “slow blink”. &lt;/strong&gt;Cats “smile” by blinking slowly, and now researchers have found that they respond positively to humans who do the same. Participants who performed a slow blink were more likely to receive one from their cat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/want-to-make-friends-with-a-cat-blink-slowly-say-scientists/&quot;&gt;reports Sara Rigby&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. Cats were also more likely to approach an experimenter who had just slow-blinked. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40483&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea that people in big cities are less likely to help strangers seems to be a myth. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers conducted experiments across 24 UK towns and cities in which they planted “lost” letters and items, or attempted to cross the road. There was no link between population density and people’s willingness to help out by returning items or stopping to let the experimenter cross, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/07/big-city-indifference-to-strangers-may-be-a-myth-study-suggests&quot;&gt;reports Natalie Grover&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scared of ghosts? Maybe science can help put you at ease.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/science/ghosts-real-science/&quot;&gt;Jake Bittle looks at&lt;/a&gt; the various psychological and physiological mechanisms that can explain why people report seeing apparitions, from basic human suggestibility to the effects of psychedelic mould.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it feels like you are living in a political bubble, you’re not alone: a recent survey found that 40% of Americans don’t have a close friend who is voting for a presidential candidate other than the one they prefer. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-friendships-are-falling-apart-over-politics-146821&quot;&gt;Melanie Green argues&lt;/a&gt; that social media is partly to blame for this polarisation, as is the increasing tendency to tie our individual identity to our political views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s probably unsurprising to learn that many of us have reported feeling deprived of touch during lockdown. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, Claudia Hammond &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201006-why-touch-matters-more-than-ever-in-the-time-of-covid-19&quot;&gt;takes a look at the studies&lt;/a&gt; that have explored the importance of human touch to our wellbeing, both before and during the pandemic.

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much can we really learn about someone’s internal states based on their body language? &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a small industry of analysts who claim to be able to understand how a person is thinking or feeling based on specific gestures. But psychologists are sceptical, &lt;a href=&quot;https://undark.org/2020/10/07/body-language-analysis/&quot;&gt;writes Ramin Skibba&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Undark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apes engage in “playful teasing” just like human toddlers, responding to requests in bizarre ways or playing silly games. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/playful-teasing-apes-could-provide-clues-evolutionary-roots-early-humor&quot;&gt;Lucy Hicks talks to anthropologist Erica Cartmill&lt;/a&gt; about the implications of this behaviour for understanding the evolutionary history of humour&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Getting real about kidney transplant timelines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=12126</guid>
	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/10/08/getting-real-about-kidney-transplant-timelines/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Getty images&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest aspects in taking care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is planning for future renal replacement needs, either dialysis or transplant options. The benefits of transplantation over dialysis are widely accepted and if someone is a medically cleared, they should be encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199912023412303&quot;&gt;pursue transplantation&lt;/a&gt;. Dialysis counseling and education is individualized for patients depending on their other medical conditions, support systems, and transplant candidacy.   For those patients that are cleared medically and have potential live donors, discussions about home dialysis training and permanent dialysis access are curtailed. The assumption that the time on dialysis will be short and therefore effort towards arteriovenous access creation or home dialysis training seems wasted. But is the wait time really that short?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02080-5&quot;&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Dr. Slyvestre &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; report on 9300 incident dialysis patients listed and cleared for transplantation, and highlight the potential complications of catheter procedures or infections and associated increased risk of death during the wait time. Most striking was the median time to transplantation for both deceased donor recipients of 15 months and 9 months for those with live donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential year on dialysis therapy, even with potential donors, raises a few questions for nephrologists. Are we adequately preparing patients for that time on dialysis while they are waiting for workup and the potential delays? Should we be looking at the home dialysis options more? Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications such as disseminated infection requiring prolonged antibiotics or delay their surgery. The wait times also suggest perhaps a closer look at the process of workup for donors to see if there are ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.14732&quot;&gt;streamline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a discussion with the patient’s transplant team to get a realistic time frame for the live donor surgery is going to be an important part of the decision making process. It will be a very different approach if a patient has a surgical date in 2 months versus a patient who has a potential donor but it is very early in the process. On the flip side, it would be important to share the information with patients so they are not getting discouraged with the wait times. Additionally, the decisions that they will make about dialysis options would be more informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need is further amplified against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.16167&quot;&gt;backdrop of the COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic and it’s impact on transplantation. While healthcare systems around the world were overwhelmed by the influx of cases, there was a need to pause on “elective” procedures. Kidney transplantation rates fell as providers scrambled to balance the risk of immunosuppression and the risk of infection from COVID-19. The transplant evaluation process is further slowed by the inability to do in person visits for a multi-disclipinary team evaluation and delays in necessary testing for medical clearance as routine testing for things like mammograms and colonoscopy were on hold. Transplant centers are actively surveilling local rates of infections and mortality rates from COVID-19 and modifying evaluation and listing processes based on the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is desire to move forward with transplantation, it needs to be done in a way to maintain the safety of donors and recipients. Nephrologists need to recognize the fluid nature of the transplantation process and help guide their patients through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: New arXivLabs feature provides instant access to code</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=694</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; launched a new Code tab, a shortcut linking Machine Learning articles with their associated code. arXivLabs provides a conduit for collaboration that invites community participation while allowing arXiv developers to focus on core services. This Code feature was developed by&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;, a free resource for researchers and practitioners to find and follow the latest Machine Learning papers and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reader activates the Code tool on the arXiv abstract record page, the author’s implementation of the code will be displayed in the tab, if available, as well as links to any community implementations. This instant access allows researchers to use and build upon the work quickly and easily, increasing code accessibility and accelerating the speed of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_710&quot; style=&quot;width: 924px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-710 size-full&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;924&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Under the abstract on an arXiv record page, you can now find code.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can also directly link code to their arXiv papers directly from their arXiv user page by clicking on the PwC icon next to the paper title. From there they will be directed to&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt; where they can add their code. Once an official implementation is added, the official code section will show up on the arXiv abstract page. From the Papers with Code site, researchers can also explore similar methods to determine which might suit their purposes best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_712&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-712&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM-1024x290.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and will only work with partners that abide by the same principles. All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt; CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;. Like all third party collaborators, Papers with Code will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted. PwC also developed&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/&quot;&gt; arXiv’s new classifier tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv thrives on collaboration and encourages everyone to submit ideas for enhancing arXiv at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nextgen@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;nextgen@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Phone Calls Help Create Closer Bonds Than Texting</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40477</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/08/phone-calls-help-create-closer-bonds-than-texting/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its many flaws, it’s hard to deny that technology has improved our ability to communicate with one another. We now have a huge range of options when it comes to speaking to our friends and family, whether we’re texting, IMing, or sending them emails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With such a smorgasbord of choices available to us, it can be easy to forget the humble phone call. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000962&quot;&gt;according to new work&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;, a reticence to pick up the phone might also be robbing us of stronger connections with those we love.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40477&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In their first study, Amit Kumar from the University of Texas at Austin and Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago looked at the experience of reconnecting with an old friend. Participants were first asked to think of someone they had fallen out of touch with, stating how long it had been since they interacted and rating the current closeness of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then imagined reconnecting with their old friend, and were asked whether they would prefer to contact them by phone or email and how they felt the interaction would go. They were then randomly assigned to actually connect with the friend either via email or by phone over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the majority of participants believed they would form a stronger bond over the phone than via email, 67% stated they would prefer to get in touch by email (a number that rose to 72% among participants who successfully completed the full experiment). This may be because of perceived awkwardness: the majority also felt that a phone call would be more awkward. Of the participants who managed to get in touch with an old friend, those assigned to the phone condition reported feeling a significantly stronger bond than those assigned to the email condition — and in the end felt no more awkward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next study looked at &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; friends. Participants were put into pairs and assigned to one of three groups — text chat, audio chat, or video chat. To get close to their new friend, participants interacted via a “sharing game”, in which both parties ask and answer intimate questions (e.g. “can you describe a time you cried in front of another person?”). Before completing the tasks, participants predicted how well they would get to know their partner, how much they would enjoy the conversation, how strong a bond it would foster, and how awkward it would be to chat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although participants did not expect different outcomes across the different forms of communication, they again felt more connected with their partner via voice-based media than when simply using text. Participants anticipated awkwardness across all three categories (which may be more to do with the very intimate and unusual task than with specific communication methods themselves), though those expectations were unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a final study, participants were again asked to imagine reconnecting with an old friend, rating how connected or awkward they expected to feel over email or phone and indicating their preferred method on a seven-point scale. The results suggested that expectations are a key driver of our choices — the more participants expected to feel connected via phone or email, the more they preferred to communicate in that form, and the more awkward they anticipated feeling the more likely they were to avoid that method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that worries about negative interactions could make people avoid potentially meaningful phone chats. But it doesn’t explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; calls are apparently so powerful. What is it about voice-based chats that make them so fulfilling? And do new forms of communication such as voice notes — voice recordings almost like voicemail — have the same effect? It would be worth exploring whether this kind of asynchronous communication has similar benefits to real-time audio and video calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of jokes and memes about younger generations hating voice calls, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/08/one-in-four-uk-smartphone-weekly-phone-calls&quot;&gt;consumer research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that many of us do indeed use our devices for everything &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than speaking on the phone. The idea that people (sometimes incorrectly) anticipate awkwardness is not too much of a reach and is backed up by findings from this paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are likely to be some individual differences here which haven’t been fully explored. A voice note might allow someone who’s shy and really does hate phone calls to communicate within their boundaries. For others, instant messaging might make them feel more present in their loved ones’ daily lives. And a long email back-and-forth might take the pressure off needing to reply instantly and give time to engage more deeply, potentially fostering a more philosophical bent to a conversation. Personality and context surely has a role to play here — and might make interesting grounds for future research into the nuances of digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Gruesome Descriptions Can Make Crimes Seem Worse — But Judges And Lawyers Are Immune To This Bias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40464</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/07/gruesome-descriptions-can-make-crimes-seem-worse-but-judges-and-lawyers-are-immune-to-this-bias/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We often like to think of ourselves as impartial decision-makers — but of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Our day-to-day thoughts and behaviours are biased in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/20/5-reasons-its-so-hard-to-think-like-a-scientist/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/20/our-brains-rapidly-and-automatically-process-opinions-we-agree-with-as-if-they-are-facts/&quot;&gt;kinds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/01/psychologists-uncover-a-new-self-serving-bias-if-its-my-theory-it-must-be-true/&quot;&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt;. But is the same true for people in the legal profession, which prides itself on its supposed objectivity and fairness?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00595-8&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications&lt;/em&gt;, judges and lawyers may be immune to at least some of the biases that affect the rest of us. In particular, their judgements seem less prone to the biasing effects of emotive language.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40464&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sandra Baez from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia and colleagues recruited 45 judges, 60 attorneys, and 64 control participants with no experience in law. All participants read a series of 24 scenarios in which someone inflicts harm on a victim, causing damage to property, injury, or death. In half of the scenarios the harm was accidental (e.g. the protagonist kills someone with his car after his brakes fail) and in half it was intentional (e.g. the protagonist speeds up to kill someone after seeing them on the road).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of the participants were given descriptions in plain language, in which the basic facts were laid out. In the car scenario, for example, they were told that the victim lies on the ground and eventually dies. But the other half were given gruesome descriptions, with graphic details about what exactly happened to the victim as they died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reading each scenario, the participants rated the morality of the protagonist’s actions, the severity of harm caused to the victim, and the amount of punishment they felt that the protagonist deserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants rated intentional harms as morally worse than accidental ones. But the language used was also important. Control participants who read scenarios framed in gruesome language rated them as more morally wrong that those who read plain language. For judges and attorneys, however, the kind of language used didn’t make a difference. This suggests that emotional language can bias people towards making more severe judgments, at least when it comes to judging morality. But legal professionals seem to be immune to this bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a subset of participants, the authors also found that changes in heart rate variability — a physiological measure of emotional arousal — were related to people’s moral judgement ratings when reading gruesome descriptions. But, again, this was only true for control participants. So it seems that gruesome language might provoke emotional physiological reactions which lay people use to guide their moral judgements, but which legal professionals have learned to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three groups of participants also rated intentional harms as more severe, and assigned harsher punishments for them, than those caused by accident. But judges and attorneys rated accidental harms as less severe and assigned a less harsh punishment for them than did controls. These results imply that those in the legal profession may also be better able to focus on a perpetrator’s intentions when harms are caused accidentally, and so take this into account when making decisions about punishment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not all good news: lawyers and judges still rated harms as more severe when caused on purpose than by accident, even though the “objective” amount of harm — e.g. damage to property — was exactly the same in both conditions. The authors say that this is an example of the “harm magnification effect”, in which people overestimate harms that are caused intentionally. This could lead to inflated legal sentences in some cases, they add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And of course, we already know judges are prone to other biases: they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/15/racial-bias-criminal-justice-system-lammy-review-magistrates-courts-jury&quot;&gt;impose stricter punishments on BAME defendants&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, and can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/16/judges-are-more-lenient-toward-a-psychopath-when-given-a-neuro-explanation-for-his-condition/&quot;&gt;swayed by neuroscientific explanations of a defendant’s behaviour&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it seems that legal professionals’ training and expertise mitigates at least some human biases in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: Seeing Red Or Feeling Blue? People Around The World Make Similar Associations Between Colours And Emotions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40455</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/06/seeing-red-or-feeling-blue-people-around-the-world-make-similar-associations-between-colours-and-emotions/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an English-speaker, I might “see red” with anger, go “green” with envy or, on a bad day, “feel blue”. To me, it seems natural to associate certain colours with particular emotions — but is the same true for people around the world? And if so, do we all make the same emotion/colour matchings? These questions have been investigated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/5G3HXWNGZTT6ZXFIHTDP/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, which has produced some fascinating results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40455&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An international team of 36 researchers, led by Domicele Jonauskaite at the University of Lausanne, analysed data gathered through the ongoing online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.unil.ch/onlinepsylab/colour/main.php&quot;&gt;International Colour-Emotion Association survey&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 4,598 adults from 30 different nations on six continents used an emotion “wheel” to report their perceptions of associations between 12 different colour terms and the 20 discrete emotions marked in “spokes” on that wheel. They could match each colour term to as many emotions as they liked, or to none, and also indicate the intensity of each emotion that they associated with a colour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that all of the nationalities in the study did indeed match colours to emotions. “The cross-modal association of colour with emotion is a universal phenomenon,” they conclude. What’s more, there were clear global similarities across the matches. Participants tended to link black with sadness, fear and/or hate; red with love and/or anger; pink with love, joy and/or pleasure; grey with sadness and/or disappointment; yellow with joy; orange with amusement; and white with relief. Across all countries, black and red were the colours most likely to be associated with emotions of any kind, while brown was the least likely. When a colour was matched to a particular emotion, the emotional intensity ratings from the various nationalities were similar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, some intriguing differences between nations also emerged. For example, Nigerians associated red with fear as well as love and anger; Chinese people associated white with sadness as well as relief; unlike other nationalities, Egyptians did not associate joy and other positive emotions with yellow; and Greeks associated purple with sadness, whereas other nationalities tended to associate purple with positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what explains the commonalities in responses, and also the differences?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some apparently universal emotion-colour links might stem from common physiological responses to different prompts. For example, a threat that we are determined to counter is associated with both a rush of blood to the face and with feelings of anger. This could, then, explain the global tendency to match red and anger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the reasons for discrepancies are pretty clear, too. While English people, for example, traditionally wear black to funerals, white is usually worn in China, and, the researchers note, Greek people occasionally wear darker shades of purple while in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the closer one nation was to another, either geographically or in terms of linguistic similarity, the more similar their colour-emotion matches were likely to be. Cultural and/or linguistic differences in how colour terms are understood or used across nations could then account for the variations in matches seen between countries, the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, differences in physical environments could have an influence too. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419303469?via=ihub&quot;&gt;the team’s own recent work&lt;/a&gt; on people from 55 nations revealed that exposure to sunshine affects the degree to which yellow is matched with joy — specifically, yellow was perceived as being more joyful in colder and rainier countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few other interesting findings came out of the team’s new analyses. Of the nationalities included in the study, people from Finland, Lithuania and New Zealand made the most colour-emotion term matches, while people from Azerbaijan and Egypt made the fewest. (Why? The team don’t know). Also, men and women made the same associations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations with the study, however. One obvious one is that the participants were all computer-literate. Perhaps they had been exposed via the internet to colour-emotion matches common in other countries and languages, and this could have helped to drive global similarities between the responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, as the team concludes: “Given our current knowledge, we suggest that colour-emotion associations represent a human psychological universal that likely contributes to shared communication and comprehension. Thus, the next time you feel blue or see red, know that the world is with you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/5G3HXWNGZTT6ZXFIHTDP/full&quot;&gt;Universal Patterns in Color-Emotion Associations Are Further Shaped by Linguistic and Geographic Proximity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: news: Swiss € 57 million Elsevier deal: A first critical evaluation after 8 months (14 August)</title>

	<description>Particularly disturbing is the fact that a 4-year contract was signed right away. Why not start with a 1-2 year contract in order to gain experience and to be able to correct any undesirable developments, like those which now come apparent? Now, swissuniversities has given up all its trump cards for four years and may soon have to advertise hybrid OA Elsevier if the publication volume does not develop as anticipated. It would actually be desirable if fewer Swiss authors were to publish in hybrid journals from Elsevier, but in genuine Open Access journals. The signal that this agreement sends out to genuine Gold Open Access publishers is also fatal. Without a public call for tenders, Elsevier has been awarded a mega-contract, while those publishers who have actually been striving for OA for years and can deliver it more cheaply will be left out in the cold.

With a PAR fee of over 4500 EUR, the price level is already extremely high, which once again shows that OA in Switzerland does not fail because of the lack of money.

The money has now been used to buy 30% OA from Elsevier. But for the 100% that swissuniversities wants to achieve by 2024, a lot still has to happen.</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Rethinking Research Assessment: Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making (part II)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18433</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/L3RHJ17jlkc/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for DORA. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;In part one of our series&lt;/a&gt; on institutional biases in review, promotion, and tenure decision making we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable. In our second part of this series we’ll show &lt;strong&gt;how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some pieces of data, such as the reputation of an applicant’s mentor or institution, or publishing in highly respected journals, are “shinier” than others. This can give initial or exceptional data points and personal reference points more perceived importance than they warrant, and privilege them over other available information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notion of anchoring, described in our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, can keep us from more even-handed or equitable judgments about data points due to the fact that we are typically heavily swayed by initial pieces of data. In a personal context, for example, when the first item on a menu is $15, other offerings that cost $12-13 seem like a pretty good deal. If, by contrast, the first item is $7, that $13 item is likely to feel comparatively overpriced. An academic version of this can occur when the first person to interview for a position sets the bar — for better or worse — for others who interview after them. Just as we can’t ever truly “unhear” something once we’ve heard it, initial anchors for value persist longer than we might expect, and tend to impact our perception of the information that follows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An additional factor that can compromise our ability to accurately gauge data points is the Halo effect, in which positive impressions of individual attributes influence our overall opinions of people or products; for example, a candidate from a prestigious institution may be assumed to have more potential than one from a lesser known university. But giving preferential treatment to people based on attributes they inherited, or which signify a small component of their overall value, may also reinforce inequitable norms by using current hierarchies as a stand-in for more thoughtful deliberation. This keeps us from considering otherwise worthy candidates or considering individuals against equal criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create intentional diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; The halo effect and anchoring can be amplified when the definition of what is valuable in academic assessment is implicit and goes unquestioned. Assembling diverse teams — across gender, seniority, cultures, and under-represented minoritized populations — brings a range of perspectives and experiences into decisions, which forces us to interrogate our own assumptions about value and quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question institutional norms:&lt;/strong&gt; Becoming more institutionally open-minded can be challenging when everyone is steeped in the same environment and set of processes. Looking outside your individual institution or discipline can provide a reality check on processes, and also broaden a sense of what’s “normal,” or even possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First things last: &lt;/strong&gt;Academics are traditionally used to seeing classic “halo” data — schools, affiliations, and publications — early and prominently in review, promotion, and tenure materials or dossiers. Placing reputation-based indicators at the end of applicant materials can reduce preconceived notions or premature perceptions of quality.&lt;br /&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;Available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The British Psychological Society - Research Digest: People Who Want To Be More Empathic May Also Develop “Liberal” Moral Values</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=40450</guid>
	<link>https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/05/people-who-want-to-be-more-empathic-may-also-develop-liberal-moral-values/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter how happy you are in yourself, there’s probably &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about your personality you’d like to change. Maybe you feel you’re too uptight or want to be more outgoing, or perhaps you’d like to be less moody or more tolerant of other people’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that such a change in personality will have some kind of social consequence, whether that’s in your relationship with your spouse or your ability to get on with your colleagues. But it might also affect which moral values you hold important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what Ivar R. Hannikainen and colleagues suggest in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656620300994?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;. They found that growth in one area, empathy, was associated with a shift in moral foundations to a more classically “liberal” style of morality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40450&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study took place over fifteen weeks, with 414 participants answering weekly “waves” of questions. First, they filled in measures exploring two facets of empathy: empathic concern and perspective-taking. Empathic concern reflects someone’s reaction to suffering (e.g. “I often have tender feelings for people less fortunate than me”), while perspective-taking looks at their tendency to take other points of view (e.g. “I try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also filled in a questionnaire looking at five “moral foundations”, or fairly broad moral values which people may prioritise in different ways. These consisted of care, fairness, loyalty to one’s ingroup, respect for authority, and observance of “purity” (for instance, keeping sexual impulses in check).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these sets of questions were repeated throughout the fifteen weeks of the study. During the first wave only, participants were also asked about their desire to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; empathic concern and perspective-taking — “I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have tender feelings towards people less fortunate than me”, for example. Demographic data, including political orientation, was also measured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in previous work, moral foundations were linked to political orientation: liberals were more concerned with the values of fairness and care than conservatives, who identified more closely with statements related to purity, authority and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what of empathy &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;? The results suggested that people can increase their levels of both empathic concern and perspective-taking: participants who had more of a desire to grow in both areas indeed saw increasing scores over the fifteen weeks. These goals also had an impact on moral foundations: those who expressed a desire to become more empathic also increased in the areas more closely linked to liberalism (fairness and care) and decreased on those areas related to conservatism (purity, authority and loyalty). Those who reported an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; increase in either facet of empathy also increased in fairness and care (though they didn’t decline in purity, authority and loyalty).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that participants saw an increase in their levels of empathy seems like positive news. But whether they were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; more empathetic and able to take others’ perspectives is hard to say considering the study relied on self-reporting. Combining self-reports with observer data may improve the validity of the findings. And although the increase in empathy was associated with a more “liberal” pattern of moral values, it’s unclear whether people’s political views actually changed (indeed, conservatives would likely argue that fairness and care are not purely liberal qualities).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might an increase in empathy see your moral foundations change? Co-author William Chopik &lt;a href=&quot;https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/The-unintended-consequence-of-becoming-an-empathetic-person&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that it may be to do with opening yourself up to other arguments. “Being a better perspective-taker exposes you to all sorts of new ideas, so it makes sense that it would change someone,” he said. “When you become more empathic, it opens up a lot of doors to change humans in other ways, including how they think about morality and ideology – which may or may not have been intended.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Who brought us COVID-19? The Neanderthals. The susceptibility to the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, but also to diabetes, obesity, allergies, skin diseases, smoking and autism all happened because your great-[...]-great-grandfather could not keep his todger in his trousers many thousands of years ago.</description>

	<title>arXiv.org blog: New classifier adds transparency to arXiv submission process</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=692</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s classification tool is now based on an algorithm developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt;Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/05/20/new-user-driven-classification-tool-released/&quot;&gt;previous classifier&lt;/a&gt;, this one helps place research articles in proper categories. This process is vitally important because proper categorization helps readers find the information they seek — and assures authors that their work will be found by the right audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv author experience will remain the same during the article submission process. The classifier automatically uses the title and abstract of a submitted article as input. Then, a machine learning model matches the research article to existing arXiv categories. If the model finds a match with a category different from the author selected category, a new recommendation will be proposed. Authors can either accept the new category recommendation or ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-classifier&quot;&gt;arXiv classifier code is publicly available on github&lt;/a&gt;, and this transparency is one key difference between the new classifier and its predecessor. arXiv values openness, and providing the machine learning methodology that underlies the classifier ensures that anyone can use and build upon it. arXiv only collaborates with partners that share arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers, who are avid arXiv readers and authors, offered their expertise to help arXiv improve the user experience. They experimented with several approaches and ended up using two open source models, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146&quot;&gt;ULMFiT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759&quot;&gt;fastText&lt;/a&gt;, trained on over 1.6 million abstracts and 120 thousand full text articles, respectively. Combined with a standard method that stratifies the data to address large category imbalance, this approach ensures that the new classifier proposes appropriate categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv continues to explore new and innovative ways to categorize articles and input from the community is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Displaying empathy towards others seems like an obvious virtue — but it can have a dark side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200930-can-empathy-be-bad-for-you&quot;&gt;writes Richard Fisher&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Empathising with a single, identifiable individual can divert time and money away from causes that could benefit many more people, for instance. And bad actors can harness our tendency to empathise with those who are similar to us in order to get us to act aggressively towards the out-group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40435&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We often think of punishment as a tool to exact revenge on those who have wronged us. &lt;/strong&gt;But this can’t be the whole story, because we also punish those who haven’t directly caused harm, but who have not distributed resources fairly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-urge-to-punish-is-not-only-about-revenge-unfairness-can-unleash-it-too-145990&quot;&gt;write researchers Paul Deutchman and Katherine McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. The pair suggests that punishment was used by our ancestors not only to deter bad behaviour, but also to level the playing field .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When there is stigma surrounding a disease, it can make it harder to bring it under control — and Covid-19 is no different. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/leprosy-covid-19-how-stigma-makes-it-harder-fight-epidemics&quot;&gt;Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar examines&lt;/a&gt; the history of health-related stigma and its relationship with racism and prejudice, and looks at how stigma has hampered public health efforts during the current pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent Pew survey of 20 countries around the world has found that, in general, people are pretty trusting of scientists&lt;/strong&gt;. But the survey also revealed some interesting trends: in English-speaking countries, for instance, conservatives were far less trusting of scientists than liberals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/global-respect-for-scientists-is-high-but-many-worry-about-the-tech-they-enable/?comments=1&quot;&gt;John Timmer has the details&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of person is prone to believing conspiracy theories? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/health/psychology-conspiracy-theories.html&quot;&gt;Benedict Carey takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And while we’re on the subject, Neuroskeptic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-myths-of-the-pineal-gland&quot;&gt;covers a particularly strange conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;It involves the pineal gland, a region of the brain which has somehow become the subject of all kinds of bizarre beliefs over recent decades.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, as it gets colder and the days draw in, we could perhaps learn something from a study of Norwegians living in the Arctic Circle&lt;/strong&gt;. Residents of Tromsø who viewed winter as a season to enjoy had better wellbeing than those who saw it as a boring or limiting time of the year. This suggests that developing a positive “winter mindset” could help you get through the coming dark months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/sep/26/dreading-a-dark-winter-lockdown-think-like-a-norwegian&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He gave a casual update on the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-mundane-spectacle-of-three-little.html&quot;&gt;Three Little Pigs&lt;/a&gt;” demo of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuralink.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt;'s 1024-channel chip, finally admitting that his lofty goals are in a “very, very primitive stage”: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/b&gt;: You can make people walk again. You could solve extreme depression or anxiety or schizophrenia or seizures. You could give a mother back her memory so she could remember who her kids are, you know. Basically, if you live long enough, you’re going to get dementia of some kind. And you’ll want to have something to help you. [&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; here, he didn't acknowledge the potential for advancements in biological treatments for dementia&lt;/i&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kara Swisher&lt;/b&gt;:  Could it program in empathy? Or other things? Do you imagine that being part of this? [LAUGHTER] Or hey you could—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EM&lt;/b&gt;: You could technically program anything. So empathy is probably a good one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;KS&lt;/b&gt;: So where are we in doing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EM&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So where we are right now is we’re still in a very, very primitive stage.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Where thus far we’ve had a lot of successful implants in pigs. And we now have a pig that has had an implant that’s working well and it’s been there for over three months. And we now have implanted about a dozen pigs. And the sensors are working well. A large part of a pig brain is about its snout. So you can literally rub the pig on its snout and we can detect exactly where you touch the snout. [&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Yeah, that's called somatotopic mapping,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/S1_somatotopic_maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Hughlings Jackson in 1886&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the podcast:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-elon-musk.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk: ‘A.I.

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Rethinking Research Assessment: Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18415</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/4v36h2FSBnE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This blog is part one in a 4-part series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field of behavioral economics emerged in the 1970s from the confluence of psychology with human judgment and decision-making, grounded in the realization that humans don’t always act “rationally” or in their best interests. Real-word applications of behavioral economics are often focused on consumers and citizens, such as increasing the percentage of adults who receive influenza vaccinations or helping people save for retirement. However, the same decision-making biases that we wrestle with in our personal lives also show up in professional settings. In fact, our misguided assumptions of rationality and expertise in academia may actually make us &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; prone to cognitive biases than we think. So when making decisions on behalf of others in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure, it is even more important to protect against shortcuts and habits in our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although recognizing personal biases is important, bias training that teaches individuals how to become more aware of decision-making tendencies has been shown to have a limited impact on actual behaviors. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674089037&quot;&gt;creating new structural and institutional conditions&lt;/a&gt; — in the parlance of behavioral economists, creating new “choice architectures” to scaffold decision-making processes — is often more effective when attempting to reduce bias in the interest of promoting and supporting more equitable practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While not a comprehensive set, we’ve identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DORA_UnintendendedCognitiveSystemBiases.pdf&quot;&gt;four major barriers to equitable decision-making in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure processes that commonly result from biased thinking&lt;/a&gt;. In the next 4 weeks we will provide examples of what these barriers are, the specific cognitive biases that feed them, and recommendations for overcoming these barriers at an institutional level. Part one delves into Objective comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “Objective” comparisons are not necessarily equitable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualitative judgments are often notoriously difficult to make, in part because their “apples and oranges” nature makes it challenging to say a single option is truly better.This can lead to well-meaning efforts to reduce complexity, such as using proxies to simplify comparisons. While qualities that can be more easily measured or ranked are appealing because they feel less subjective, the temptation to rely on quantifiable indicators to signal quality has some &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/&quot;&gt;significant implications on &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to oversimplifying options in an effort to make them more comparable, the urge to measure things can imbue measurability itself with outsized importance. But as &lt;strong&gt;Campbell’s Law&lt;/strong&gt; has long made clear, once indicators are accepted as a way to gauge value, they start to lose meaning as objective measures. Instead, they increase the temptation to focus on a narrow set of activities and reduce investment in reviewing other meaningful, but less rewarded, achievements. Publishing research in venues with high Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) is a classic example: Due to the perceived importance of citations and “high-quality” publications in promotion and tenure dossiers, decisions about what research to conduct, submit, and publish can lead evaluators to prioritize research with a higher likelihood of getting published in the “right” journals over other forms of impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second form of objectivity bias is the &lt;strong&gt;Matthew effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which describes the tendency forresources to flow to those who already have them. This can occur when a lack of time or motivation to vet results means that decision-makers default to preconceived ideas about what seems good, such as when researchers with long track records of grants receive a disproportionate amount of new funding. Another example of the Matthew effect is when highly cited references become more cited in part becauseresearchers see that they’re highly cited, rather than because they are more relevant or higher quality. This tendency is more likely to increase as our reliance on automation as a means to customize or deliver content grows, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464884920915374&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; where popular items are more heavily promoted in newsfeeds or where items recommended by Amazon attract more hits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the notion of &lt;strong&gt;anchoring&lt;/strong&gt; — a cornerstone of early behavioral economics research, in which the first piece of data we see or hear defines the reference point against which subsequent data is compared — can create a false sense of objectivity and inadvertently emphasize relative comparisons between options rather than their actual values. For example, receiving a $2 million dollar grant one year may anchor one’s expectations for the value of future grants, causing a $1.2 million grant to feel comparatively disappointing. But anchoring can also manifest in a more general, qualitative context, such as when using one’s own personal life as an “anchor’ to judge others’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualize data.&lt;/strong&gt; Relying wholly on quantifiable measures can contribute to a false sense of objectivity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12052&quot;&gt;Structured interview and review protocols&lt;/a&gt; can reduce inequities in review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) decision-making. Balancing the use of quantitative metrics with qualitative inputs, like narrative CV formats that capture more intangible qualities, can help create a counterweight by contextualizing data points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify standards.&lt;/strong&gt; The temptation to anchor on old assumptions of what good researcher performance looks like often arises out of habit. To counter the urge to use a narrow or an anecdotal set of data that emphasize legacy notions of importance, institutions and decision-makers can elicit and select standards gathered from a wider set of sources and based on a more holistic set of values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance quantitative and qualitative measures.&lt;/strong&gt; The human tendency to bend our behaviors to meet quantifiable targets is stronger than we think. Institutions should actively identify and recognize where setting specific, quantifiable goals may reinforce some behaviors at the expense of others. Institutions should make sure that what is being measured adheres to organizational or disciplinary goals and values, like achieving real-world impact, rather than what is easiest to measure, such as university rankings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next Monday we’ll tackle how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The putamen is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subcortical&lt;/a&gt; structure that is part of a group of structures known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;. It is also a component of the dorsal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/striatum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;striatum&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the putamen and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/caudate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caudate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;. The putamen is adjacent to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt;, and the putamen and globus pallidus together are sometimes referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lentiform-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lentiform or lenticular nucleus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the putamen and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a component of the basal ganglia, the putamen is best known for its role in facilitating movement. To understand the putamen’s role in movement, it’s helpful to think about how the basal ganglia as a whole may contribute to movement. While this has not been determined definitively, one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia are important for facilitating desired movements while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this 2-Minute Neuroscience video to learn more about the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The putamen (and striatum as a whole) is thought to act as a critical input area for the basal ganglia. In other words, to accomplish their movement-related functions, the basal ganglia need to receive information from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; about movements that you want to make. Much of this information travels first to the putamen or the caudate via a pathway called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticostriatal-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corticostriatal pathway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most of the neurons in the putamen contain the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt; and extend out of the putamen to other regions of the basal ganglia— specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons that leave the putamen create pathways that are thought to be involved in either the facilitation or inhibition of movements (depending on the pathway). &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9004351/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research suggests that neurons in the putamen are activated before and during movement&lt;/a&gt;—especially movement of the limbs and torso. It is thought that the firing of these putamen neurons contributes not only to the initiation of a movement, but also to the decision to make a movement and the selection of a movement to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For years, the putamen was considered to be primarily devoted to movement. But more recent research has begun to point to an expanded role for the putamen. For example, it is now thought that that the putamen is also involved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12052921/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;learning and memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28585051/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569212/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dysfunction in the putamen could be a factor in a number of disorders, but is strongly linked to problems with motor function. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/huntingtons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huntington’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (HD), for example—which is characterized by rapid and spasmodic involuntary movements—is associated with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529157&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; the degeneration and death of neurons in the caudate and putamen&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons may be involved with the inhibition of unwanted movements, and their degeneration in HD may cause involuntary movement to be more difficult to suppress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neurodegeneration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; in the basal ganglia is also the hallmark pathological sign of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (PD), a condition that causes slow, labored movement along with tremors (among other symptoms). With PD, the neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;, but other areas of the basal ganglia—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like the putamen&lt;/a&gt;—are also affected. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30465864/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abnormalities in dopamine function in the putamen&lt;/a&gt; are thought to contribute to the movement problems PD patients experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(in addition to linked text above)&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mink JW.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of arXiv smiley bones flask&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-682 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-272x300.png&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv has launched a new, formalized framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs, a concept developed years ago, acts as a conduit for collaboration. Now, it appears as a physical space on the article record page, and, importantly, sets guidelines for collaborations between arXiv and third parties, ensuring that partners share arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The arXivLabs framework complements other collaborative projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/&quot;&gt;arXiv’s Kaggle dataset&lt;/a&gt;,” said Presani, “and demonstrates how great results are achieved when the community works together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv readers will now find a new feature, below existing content on the article record page, that reflects the new framework. The arXivLabs tabs highlight different experimental tools developed by collaborators, and will be updated as new tools become available. These add value and functionality for both readers and authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. This enables discovery of relevant research by providing user-friendly navigation of an article’s citation tree. The Explorer, developed by Matt Bierbaum, was already available on the site, and will now be featured in the “Bibliographic Tools” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool, the CORE Recommender, facilitates the exploration of relevant open access papers from a global network of research repositories and is now accessible on the “Recommenders” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv’s third party collaborators&lt;/a&gt; will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request, this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Scientists are flawed, stressed, inspired, kind… we are human</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18422</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/3UagoDhLcD0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This post was written by Alexia A., Hannah Dee, Karel Green, Alison Young and Yolanda Ohene from Scientists are Humans and Rebecca Kirk from PLOS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kindness matters, in life generally, but also in the research environment. This simple concept was behind the launch two years ago of the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/&quot;&gt;Scientists Are Humans&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim to support scientists to move the research culture to be more kind; with the aim to change the game. We want to amplify even more voices on the site, including yours, so please get in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/want-to-support-scientists-are-humans/&quot;&gt;touch &lt;/a&gt;to share your story (we are flexible about format and posts can be anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website was one outcome of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stemgamechangers.github.io/&quot;&gt;Gamechangers for diversity in STEM&lt;/a&gt; (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) event in London run at the Turing Institute. This two-day workshop initiated and fostered projects to support more diversity in STEM. The concept of Scientists Are Humans is that the challenges faced by minorities in STEM could be ameliorated with more understanding and more kindness. One of the ways we can build understanding is by telling our stories, and listening kindly when others tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why is kindness so important? A look at the content of the website quickly makes it clear how it can make a huge difference. In the past two years the website published articles reporting from picket lines, about the BLM movement, on leaving academia, on struggling and completing PhDs, on being an ally, on mental health and on being brave – amongst many others. The variety of voices, and the clarity with which they speak has been inspiring, thought provoking and has humanized the science and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The importance of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/manifesto/&quot;&gt;manifesto &lt;/a&gt;for being more kind could not be more important as we all find our own ways to manage the particular challenges that we are facing at the moment. We all need to be more kind, and we will all benefit from a profession with kindness at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>n recent years, fake news has become a growing problem in the international information landscape. More and more projects deal with how to expose and avoid them. One of them is the project of Charles Letaillieur and Sylvain Massip. With a tool for the general public, the two want to support checking simple messages for their truthfulness with the help of open access publications and of artificial intelligence.</description>

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Interview with Bruno Pichler</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/?p=6555</guid>
	<link>https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/interview-with-bruno-pichler/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bruno Pichler studied medicine, obtained a PhD in neuroscience, worked in the labs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifn.me.tum.de/new/konnerth.php&quot;&gt;Arthur Konnerth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab&quot;&gt;Tom Mrsic-Flogel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab&quot;&gt;Troy Margrie&lt;/a&gt;, and was R&amp;amp;D manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientifica.uk.com/&quot;&gt;Scientifica&lt;/a&gt;, before founding his own company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inss.org.uk/&quot;&gt;INSS&lt;/a&gt;, “to provide the international neuroscience community with bespoke hard- and software solutions and other consulting services”. He is not only a highly experienced builder and designer of two-photon microscopes but also a very friendly and open human being. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to ask him a couple of questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview took place on September 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; 2020 in a virtual meeting and lasted around 1.5 hours. Afterwards, I transcribed, shortened and edited the recorded interview. For a brief orientation, here’s an ordered but non-exhaustive list of the topics discussed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why neuroscience?&lt;br /&gt;How to get into optics and programming&lt;br /&gt;Role models&lt;br /&gt;Projects in academia&lt;br /&gt;Why didn’t you become a PI?&lt;br /&gt;At Scientifica&lt;br /&gt;Founding one’s own company&lt;br /&gt;Brexit&lt;br /&gt;Performance checks for a 2P scope&lt;br /&gt;Preamplifiers&lt;br /&gt;How to clean optics&lt;br /&gt;The detection path&lt;br /&gt;Teaching people how to solve problems&lt;br /&gt;Mesoscopes&lt;br /&gt;mesoSPIM&lt;br /&gt;AODs&lt;br /&gt;Fixed-wavelength lasers&lt;br /&gt;Multiplexed acquisition&lt;br /&gt;Scanimage&lt;br /&gt;Okinawa&lt;br /&gt;Advice to young scientists&lt;br /&gt;Bluegrass music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find any questionable statements, you should consider blaming my editing first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And since the entire interview is quite long, take a cup of tea, and take your time to read it&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-white-color has-text-color&quot;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Rupprecht: &lt;/strong&gt;You studied medicine before you started your PhD. What was your motivation to do a PhD in neuroscience, and to continue in neuroscience afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bruno Pichler:&lt;/strong&gt; This was just something that happened: I really loved the first years of medical school, basic science, physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and all that. But halfway through medical school when the clinical work started, I realized that it wasn’t for me. So I looked for new inspiration, and I stumbled upon the website of Arthur Konnerth’s lab. I called on a whim and half an hour later I was in his office, and he offered me a job. He said, “why don’t you take a year off from medical school and start working towards a PhD here?” So I worked full-time in the lab for a year, and then went back to finish medical school. But at that point I had no interest in a career in clinical medicine, I just wanted to complete the medical degree and then work in the lab and continue my PhD. – So, not much thought behind it, it’s just how things transpired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; The medical studies did not really prepare you well for the more technical aspects of what you have been doing afterwards. How did you learn all of this, for example optics, or programming?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Again, it was just something that happened: there were microscopes that needed troubleshooting, there were things I didn’t understand, and every time I didn’t understand something, I tried to find more information about it. Some of the information sticks with you – and that’s how you learn and how you get into optics and software.&lt;br /&gt;For example, there was some custom-written image analysis software in the lab and I didn’t really understand what it did to the data, so I sat down with the guy who wrote it and asked about all the calculations it made and then I cautiously started to make some changes to it – and it just naturally emerged from there. I never consciously sat down and said, “oh, I want to learn programming!” I had a problem in front of me that I needed to solve, and so I solved it. And whatever I learned while solving it is now part of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“People who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; So would you describe yourself as a problem-solver?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that is probably an accurate description. My main driving force is that whenever I see a technical problem, I want to find an elegant solution for it. I can’t help it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you have a role model as a scientist, or somebody who inspired you to continue with neuroscience?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I definitely have a few people who inspired me, but I wouldn’t say I had a ‘role model’. There’s obviously the intellectual giants like Richard Feynman or Horace Barlow. Then there are the scientists that I worked with, Arthur Konnerth, Tom Mrsic-Flogel, Troy Margrie, and of course all the colleagues in those labs. But, on a very practical level, people who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops. For example, Werner Zeitz, the electronics guy in Arthur Konnerth’s lab, who is known for his famous Zeitz puller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeitz-puller.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.zeitz-puller.com/&lt;/a&gt;). We were building a two-photon resonant scanner with Werner back in 2004/2005, and he built a 19” rack-mountable device box – no labels on it, just unlabeled pots and BNC connectors – which transformed the scanning data into a TV image and sent it to a frame grabber card. Nowadays, we do this in software but it was all done in hardware at the time. Same with the mechanical guy, Dietmar Beyer: He was such a skilled manual machinist, and he would just make whatever we needed without any CNC machining. Another guy that really inspired me back as a PhD student was Yury Kovalchuk. He was a senior postdoc at the time. He knew everything about two-photon microscopy, and he was building an AOD scanner back in 2004/2005. It was the way he understood these systems and explained everything to me whenever I had any questions – those kind of people inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; From your entire academic career, what was your most rewarding project, big or small?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s so difficult to say, because everything is kind of rewarding. What I can certainly say is that I don’t believe in putting off reward for a long time, and the idea that ‘the more you suffer, the bigger the reward’. I like it when you have smaller rewards, but more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I can definitely relate to this… but at least scientific publications usually do not come so frequently. If you have to choose, which scientific publication where you took part in would you like to highlight, and what was your contribution?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;There was a paper in 2012 by Kamilla Angelo in Troy Margrie’s lab (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442227/&quot;&gt;paper link&lt;/a&gt;). I came very late to the party, all the experiments had already been done, the first version of the manuscript had been completed, and Troy just asked me to read it and give some comments. I noticed something in the analysis where the manuscript didn’t actually show unambiguously one aspect of the claim in the paper. We tried to come up with some way to design new experiments to prove that unambiguously, but at some point it occurred to me that you could just do it with the existing data, just with a different type of analysis. And once the idea had come up of doing this pair-wise scrambling of all the data points and then calculating pair-wise differences, it was very quick and easy to write some code to analyze it. And it supported exactly what we thought it would support, but now unambiguously. That felt really rewarding, to be able to nail something that would have otherwise required more experiments with a bit of clever analysis, that was really cool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like that! Especially your PI was probably really happy about this, because it saved a lot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess so. The paper would have been highly publishable without my input, but it was just ever so slightly better with my input; and that’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Why did you not become a PI yourself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, to start with, I was never really PI material …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you define as PI material?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Are you okay with an AC/DC reference? Would you understand what I mean when I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;No, not really …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Malcolm Young was the rhythm guitarist in AC/DC, he was always in the background and played this steady rhythm, whereas Angus Young is the flamboyant lead guitarist in his school uniform who runs up and down the stage and is the focal point of attention for the audience. When I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”, I’m talking about having a rock-solid line of people in the back who make sure that the lead guitarist and the lead singer can shine: I like to be in that role at the back. As a PI, you have to represent the lab, you have to present your work outside, you have to sell the ideas to funding bodies… so you have to have a little bit more of a flamboyant and outgoing nature. I’m too shy for this, so the PI path was never really on the cards for me to begin with. I was quite happy to be a sort of a medium level scientist – except that I felt there was more I could do to help other people. It felt self-indulgent to just play around with cool technology and have brainy conversations with smart people in the lab. I wanted to provide some value for others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; And then you chose Scientifica. Why Scientifica? How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I did not really choose Scientifica. I wasn’t actually looking for a job when I left academia. My plan was to go back to the Bavarian Alps and work as a skiing instructor –that’s what I had done before I went to medical school. I figured that it would be really nice to do that again for a season, to pass the time until some new opportunity floated past. And then it just so happened that the opportunity to work at Scientifica floated past earlier than I had anticipated. They rang me and said, “we’ve heard you’re leaving academia and we’re looking for a software person to do some custom stuff for Scientifica’s two-photon customers”, and I was like “well, that sounds like a good idea”, and then I joined Scientifica. There was no job interview, there was no searching for a job, the job found me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; How was the work like at Scientifica?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially it was mostly intended to be customization of software, for example little Matlab add-ons for Scanimage or stuff like that. But then we also needed a resonant scanning system, and there wasn’t really any software available for resonant scanning before Vidriotech started …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; … and then you wrote SciScan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;And that’s when I wrote SciScan. I had already written a software for resonant scanning in Labview some years before – for the frame-grabber that we discussed earlier, so I already knew what to do. While writing SciScan I also became involved in the hardware development of the resonant scanner, with the mechanical engineer and the electrical engineer. And so the job role gradually moved towards R&amp;amp;D management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a bit younger, so I don’t know whether the resonant scanners always came from Cambridge Technology, or was there a different provider? Or did you build the scanners in-house at Scientifica?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, the resonant scanners were always the same as back in 2003 when I first started using them. The manufacturer was originally called General Scanning Inc, then it became GSI Lumonics, which later merged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridgetechnology.com/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which was then bought by Novanta. There was a number of name changes involved, but no changes to the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you tried out resonant scanners from other companies as well?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m only aware of one other resonant scanner that is suitable for what we’re doing and that’s from a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eopc.com/scanners.html&quot;&gt;EOPC&lt;/a&gt;. I have not actually worked with their resonant scanners yet, but I will be in probably about two weeks from now. We have bought two of their resonant scanners, because they can be synchronized with each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like a challenging project. Probably with two pulsed lasers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, it’s about temporal multiplexing with a single laser. We want the scanners to run in synchrony so that we can use a single data acquisition system for the two paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, this makes sense. – After Scientifica, you founded your own company, INSS. What was the biggest challenge when you got started? And why did you found your own company?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;The ‘why’ is very easy to explain: When I started with Scientifica, I was very close to the customers, I was building custom software modules, was interacting with scientists very closely when it came to making hardware modifications to any of the existing products or new suggestions for new hardware products. As the company grew bigger, I got more into a management role. I felt I was getting a little bit too far away from the customer and more involved in managing people and conducting things internally. It is a whole different style of working when you want to make something that is not a prototype but a production item where you want to sell 100 pieces of. Then you have to think more about questions like, how can we design it in a way that you can build it routinely and efficiently, and you have to think about all the supply chain, and build assembly instructions, and how you teach people to do that. There’s a lot of work in the background that is relatively far away from the actual experiment that the neuroscientist is going to do with that microscope and I felt like I wanted to get closer to that again. Also, if you want to sell hundreds of microscopes, it’s not really economically viable to do individual customer specials. From a business development perspective it’s perfectly understandable that Scientifica wanted to have a more standard offering and make off-the-shelf turn-key systems. But that was not so much what I was interested in. I like getting involved in changing things, not making the same thing all the time. I also felt that this sort of very customized, individualized service was not something that was available. When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true. If you’re a scientist you either buy a microscope that someone has designed to fit many purposes, but it may not be perfect for your very specific purpose. And I thought, well, surely there’s a need for modifying, customizing, making something perfect for a particular experiment and stripping out everything else that may not be needed. If you custom-build it from off-the-shelf components, you can save a lot of money. And surely from the money that people save they’d be quite happy to give me some of it, if I advise them how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Didn’t it feel like shaky ground when you started? I mean, you were responsible for everything, and you didn’t get a salary anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I think what helped a lot is that I’ve been involved in the music scene, and I knew a lot of musicians that were self-employed. They were getting money from gigs and teaching and playing on other people’s records and they were making a living without being employed – and I felt I could do the same thing. I had been playing gigs, I knew how to ask a pub owner to pay us money for providing music in the pub. And I figured, conceptually it wouldn’t be much different whether I come to your lab and build something for you, or whether I come to your pub and play a gig for you. You just ask beforehand how much you’re going to get paid for the gig, and if it isn’t enough to cover the costs then you can’t play that gig – it’s not exactly rocket science. It was good that I’d done it for a few years in the music business, it gave me a lot more confidence that this would work out in the microscope consulting business, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;INSS is based in the UK. Have you been affected by the Brexit so far, or will you be affected by it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I haven’t been affected by Brexit yet, everything is still the same until the end of 2020. Nobody knows what sort of forms we will need to fill in next year, and what sort of new hoops we might need to jump through. I’m not going to start worrying about that now because I don’t know what it’s going to be. – Don’t get me wrong: Brexit will be disastrous on so many levels, especially now, piling onto the coronavirus crisis. And of course it’s also a little bit disappointing… I’ve lived in this country for 13 years and I feel like I made a nice contribution, doing science, paying taxes, playing music. And then all these people feel that someone like me shouldn’t be here because we’re a burden on the country and they’d rather pull up the drawbridge; and they think it’s worth taking all these economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit just to keep people like me out of their country. But if that’s what the majority voted for, then I just have to deal with this somehow. I’m reasonably optimistic that I’ll find some way to navigate these new circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I get the impression that you are quite optimistic in general. Do you think this is a requirement for being self-employed?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I think it’s probably a requirement if you don’t want to live a life in misery. You have to be somewhat optimistic or at least relaxed about what the future might hold because the future is kind of uncertain. You’re not going to know what’s going to happen. If you worry about it, it will not change the fact that the future is uncertain. So you might as well say “I’ll jump down that bridge when I get there”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t mind, let’s talk about some technical questions … after you set up a two-photon microscope in somebody’s lab, how do you quickly check its performance? Do you have a specific routine?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;The quickest performance check is to image a pollen grain slide. You check how the spiky pollen grains look like, whether you can section them nicely and how the field of view [FOV] is like. Once you’ve done it a few times, it is everything you need to get a quick qualitative idea of whether everything is working fine. If you want to do it more quantitatively then you obviously want to image beads, you want to check your field flatness, you want to get your precise FOV measurements with some grids, and so on. We have a routine that we’re working with that we constantly improve, but in the majority of cases that’s not even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there are some companies which sell special calibration slides or samples. When would this be useful, or do you think it is overkill?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to use those, but they are not really suitable for 2P. You are talking about the Argolight probes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; So, they specifically mention that you shouldn’t be using them with 2P, or you use them at your own risk. Also, they cost about 8’000 euros. I don’t really want to spend 8’000 euros on something where I can quickly exceed the damage threshold, and that’s why I haven’t used them. I would love to have something like that if it’s available for two photon. In the meantime, I’ll stick with these electron microscopy grids and beads and pollen grains. – What are your thoughts on those, have you tried anything like that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Several years ago I also wanted to check the field curvature for a two-photon microscope and borrowed a quite expensive calibration slide from the confocal microscopy facility, but I managed to destroy it, and that’s when I stopped experimenting. Usually, I just use beads and fluorescent plastic slides. Not so much pollen grains, because I have destroyed the slides several times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(curious) &lt;/em&gt;How do you destroy a pollen grain slide?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Just by leaving the slide somewhere in the setup, until something makes the glass break; which happened to me twice so far. I also made some simple pollen samples in agar, but that’s not possible in winter or autumn. So I’m usually sticking to beads. But in principle I agree, pollen slides are ideal, you quickly find the samples and you can also check how the fluorescence yield changes across the FOV. Do you make your own pollen grain slides?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re using pollen slides from Carolina Biological Supply Company. They make these ready-made pollen grain slides for schools and educational settings and the slide is like five dollars or something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn’t know they were so cheap! The first scanning confocal microscope that I used [a Leica SP5] had come with a pollen slide, and I had been instructed to treat the slide very carefully, because it was so expensive… So it’s good to know that it can be really cheap! – Just another question about two-photon microscopes: which preamplifier would you recommend for a standard resonant scanning two-photon microscope?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We often use the Thorlabs preamps, the TIA60, and we also use the Thorlabs PMTs with the built-in preamps, which is quite convenient. You control them through USB, and you can set the amplifier bandwidth in software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;I thought the bandwidth was fixed at 60 MHz?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for the TIA60 preamps, it’s fixed at 60 MHz. For the PMTs with the built-in preamplifiers, you can choose between, I think, 80 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 200 kHz. When we need higher bandwidth for something, then we would use Femto preamps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Which one is your preferred preamp from Femto?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I use the 400 MHz one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s talk about objectives… If you were postdoc in a lab and could choose any objective for testing, which one would you choose?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I had a Nikon 25x NA1.1 when I was in Troy’s lab, and that’s a really nice objective. For the typical applications I was working at – population calcium imaging – that’s just a beautiful objective. I wouldn’t really need to try anything else. I’m sure there are other applications that would benefit from some of these newer Olympus long working distance objectives, but it’s so application specific, and there’s good uses for all of them. So, without having a particular experiment in mind, it would be difficult to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; For these Olympus objectives, I think the working distance is something like 4 or 8 mm. Does the 8 mm make any sense for neuroscience applications?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, it depends on your application, right? These objectives were primarily designed for cleared brains, where you don’t have much of a choice, you either use a long working distance or you’re not imaging all of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, I didn’t know that it was for designed for cleared brains. Now, this makes much more sense to me. – Speaking about objectives, how do you usually clean optical elements? Do you use tap water or distilled water, or can you recommend any other protocols?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers. You just try to blow everything off that might be there. If that doesn’t work with the blower, you get out the compressed air can. From there, we’ll go to distilled water, and then Purosol. If I can’t get it off with that, I would go to isopropyl alcohol, and then to methanol. But we’re usually dealing with new microscopes, so in the vast majority of cases, we don’t have to go past the compressed air can.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you do with dichroics if they’re dirty or if there’s sticky dust on top of them? Is there anything you can do?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn’t really want to go far beyond the distilled water on a dichroic. If I can’t get it off with that, I might try the Purosol, but we don’t encounter dirty dichroics very often, because most of the optics we’re working with are brand new.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Another question about 2P microscopes: I was always wondering about a proper way to test the alignment and performance of collection optics. How do you check whether collection optics are properly aligned?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to capture all the light that’s coming out of the back aperture of the objective. So, if you just put some light source and a diffuser under the objective – that can be the LED on a phone with a bit of lens tissue on top as a diffuser –, you’ll get a large cone of light coming out the back aperture. Then you screw in a little target at the position where your PMT will be sitting. You should see a spot right in the center that has the size of the PMT sensor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Just to repeat, it’s important to remove the PMT in this case, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, you need to remove the PMT and put a target in its place. If you want to do it more quantitatively, it gets difficult. You could use a calibrated light source and count how many photons you get through and compare that over many microscopes and so on. But I don’t think anyone is doing that in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s assume a customer writes to you that there’s a problem with their two-photon system, “because the signal becomes weaker”. This is something I also often hear from less experienced colleagues or friends who ask for some help with their setup. What would be your first guess if you don’t know anything else?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; In the first instance I would think of it as a great opportunity to help someone to think systematically about the problem. Because if all they tell me is that “the signal becomes weaker”, then they haven’t really thought about how to communicate a problem in such a way that the other person can do something with it. I would need to know so much more , for example: what’s the signal? what’s the system? what are you measuring? have you done the same experiment over a year, and every day it gets a little bit weaker?, or is that happening within the same animal, or within the same slice? … there’s a thousand different questions. I need to find out what the person means by “signal”, what the person means by “becomes”, what they mean by “weaker”. It’ll be beneficial for that person, and for me, if I can teach them how to clarify their thoughts to themselves, and then communicate them efficiently. Maybe next time they know immediately why it’s becoming weaker simply because they’ve changed the way they think.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I enjoy it very much to help someone to clarify to themselves what the problem is. It’s very rewarding for the person to figure out the problem by themselves, and it’s rewarding for me to teach someone a problem-solving skill that they might not have had before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;I think you have also participated in some summer schools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s right, I’ve been at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-IMAG&amp;amp;year=19&quot;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor imaging course&lt;/a&gt; five times – which is great fun, a great location and great teachers. I’m also participating every year at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenss.ro/&quot;&gt;TENSS&lt;/a&gt; in Romania, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School, again a great team of people that are running it with great lecturers and great spirit among students and all the TAs and lecturers. I really enjoy teaching people and helping them to figure things out. I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves. I might nudge them in the right direction, but if I simply told them what to do, I feel I’d be depriving them of a joyful moment of revelation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;It can also be a bit dangerous to align laser beams, and especially invisible IR beams. To make the laser beam visible, do you use IR viewers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I use them occasionally, but only when I have to, so only when I’m working with a fixed-wavelength laser. And even then I try to do as much as I can with viewing cards rather than the viewer itself. Although I tend to go back and forth a little bit between card and viewer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; For the tunable lasers, do you switch to visible wavelengths or what do you think about the pointing stability of those lasers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I usually align everything in the visible range and then, once we switch to IR, I image a uniform slide and check if our alignment is nice and centered. The illumination on the slide tells you whether you’ve gone off a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; To clarify, I was thinking more about pointing stability when changing the wavelength of the tunable laser for example from 700 nm to 900 nm…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think the changes are drastic. But we’re doing the final alignment through the actual scan head based on what we’re seeing on the computer screen from the fluorescent slide, and we’re doing that at 900 or 930 nm anyway. In that sense, the visible beam is only a first approximation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; But this also means that you have to be quite tall, because otherwise you cannot reach the adjustment screws of the mirrors and at the same time look at the screen to check the fluorescence of the slide…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, you need some access to those screws and a clear visual path to the computer monitor. You can walk around the table and do it from the back, as long as you can see the computer screen, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes… probably I was just thinking about some situations in the past where I tried to do this myself and needed to stretch quite far to reach the adjustment screw and at the same time look around the corner to see the screen …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you tried moving the screen?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really … okay, I think you’ve identified the problem, it’s just laziness from my side! – But one more question about objectives: what do you think about two-photon mesoscopes with FOVs of several millimeters? Are they more difficult to build or maintain? Do you think they will become more standard or is it just a trend?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;It completely depends on the application. If there are experiments that you can’t do with a standard FOV microscope, you need a wide FOV microscope. If you want to image two areas simultaneously with cellular resolution that are too far apart for a normal FOV, you don’t really have that much of a choice. A microscope like that is certainly more difficult to build, because you need custom optics for it, which are really expensive, and that is something that will prevent them from becoming really standard in every lab very soon. A lot of experiments don’t require such large FOV microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you don’t think that these objectives or lenses will become much cheaper in the future and allow them to become more standard?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think they’ll go down in price very much. And they’re also difficult to maintain, and you need custom pre-chirpers. You basically need a dedicated imaging engineer in the lab who’s maintaining those microscopes, and even if you buy it commercially, for example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646&quot;&gt;2P RAM mesoscope&lt;/a&gt; from Thorlabs, you need someone who’s working with that microscope every day to monitor its performance and fine tune it and so on and so forth. I hope that we’ll see a few more mesoscopes popping up in the future, because there are very interesting questions that you can answer with them, and maybe the prices will come down a little bit. But I don’t think they’ll come down far enough for it to be a standard thing that everyone has.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you also have any experience with setting up confocal microscopes or light-sheet microscopes and, if yes, how is this different from setting up two-photon microscopes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I have not set up a confocal microscope so far, but I have set up a mesoSPIM light sheet microscope that your colleague Fabian [Voigt] in Fritjof [Helmchen]’s lab has designed. It was a very different experience in the sense that this was probably the first time that we’ve built something where we had basically no input in the design, and we were following someone else’s instructions. That was a little bit daunting, simply because I’d never done it before, but Fabian’s documentation is just so excellent that it turned out to be not a problem at all, and in that sense it was not much different to what we usually do when building a two-photon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you also have any plans of building a three-photon microscope?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to build whatever people ask me to build. We’ve done a lot of 2p microscopes, but we’ve also built wide-field microscopes, we’ve built a mesoSPIM, we’re working on a microscope for in-situ sequencing, I’ve helped people with LabView coding. Whatever it is that people ask me, if I have time to do it and it sounds interesting, I’ll do it. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; So, even if I gave you a lot of money to make you build a 3D AOD-based two-photon scanning microscope, would you give it a try? I’ve heard that it is extremely challenging to make this run stably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I would certainly try it – and get the right people involved. I was actually a co-author on an AOD paper some ten years ago with people from Angus Silver’s lab. AOD systems are a little bit finicky, but with the right person, with the right project, with the right collaborators on board, I don’t see why someone who wants an AOD system shouldn’t attempt to build one. I’m sure that some of these teething problems that any new technology always has will be ironed out over the next few years&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you’re quite optimistic about the future role of AOD scopes for two-photon microscopy?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;For the right applications – yes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;As we mentioned you also provide your service in order to help your customers save costs. If a lab really wants to save money, would you recommend to buy a fixed-wavelength laser for two-photon microscopy? I’m also not sure whether there are already some 920 nanometer lasers around …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;There are now a few manufacturers that build fixed wavelength 920 nanometer lasers, and if someone says, all I’m going to do with this microscope for the next three or four years is GCaMP imaging and I just want to have a workhorse for that, then that’s certainly a good option. If it’s a young lab that only has a single two-photon microscope in the lab, and they don’t know exactly what sort of projects might come along next year and what sort of dyes they might be using next year, then it’s a bit of a risk to bet all your money on a single wavelength. This is probably more something for labs that have another two-photon with a tunable laser, where they can do experiments in the red or where they can explore other dyes that aren’t excitable at 920 nm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have examples for companies which sell fixed wavelength lasers at 920 nm?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Coherent are selling one now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coherent.com/lasers/laser/axon&quot;&gt;Axon 920&lt;/a&gt;; Spark Lasers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark-lasers.com/compact-femtosecond-laser-biophotonics-alcor/&quot;&gt;a few options&lt;/a&gt; for 920 nm; there’s Menlo, a company in Munich that sells the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.menlosystems.com/products/femtosecond-lasers-and-amplifiers/ylmo930/&quot;&gt;Ylmo-930&lt;/a&gt;; Toptica have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptica.com/products/psfs-fiber-lasers/femtofiber-ultra/femtofiber-ultra-920/&quot;&gt;920 model&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nktphotonics.com/lasers-fibers/product-category/koheras-single-frequency-lasers/&quot;&gt;NKT Photonics&lt;/a&gt; – there’s quite a few around now. I haven’t actually tried any of them yet, but it’s certainly going in a direction where we’ll be seeing these more often in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Another technical question – you mentioned it already: what’s your opinion on multiplexed acquisition? Will it remain a niche product like the mesoscopes, or do you think it will become much more standard?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Again it depends completely on your application … if you want to image two areas simultaneously without having to jump between them – whether that’s on a mesoscope where you image two different brain areas that are millimeters apart, or whether you want to image a single neuron and you want to image soma and spines both with very zoomed-in resolutions, but without having to jump between them – then multiplexed acquisition can be the right technique. If you don’t have the right question for multiplexed acquisition, then there’s no point getting it. All of these things are only useful in a very particular context that depends on the scientific question that you want to answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I always thought that multiplexed acquisition might be particularly difficult to implement because it’s not only challenging in terms of hardware and optical alignment, but also the software to disentangle the two multiplexed photon streams is not trivial. I was thinking that this combination of both hardware and software challenges might be a bottleneck which prevents many people from doing it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well… you can also de-multiplex the channels in hardware using an analog system. Spencer Smith and Jeffrey Stirman used a nice system in their 2016 Nature Biotechnology paper with a wide FOV (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27347754/&quot;&gt;paper link&lt;/a&gt;), where they actually had an analog photon-counting system and then just acquired with a standard data acquisition system. They didn’t need to change anything in software because all the photon counting was done in the analog domain. But now, with these gigahertz data acquisition systems, you can acquire the data fast enough, get the laser timing and then assign different acquisition time bins to different channels. Scanimage can do that now, so it’s not really a challenge any more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have an opinion about the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://vidriotechnologies.com/vdaq/&quot;&gt;vDAQ&lt;/a&gt; system of Scanimage? I think it’s not based on National Instruments hardware any more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve built a couple of microscopes with those systems, and they seem very nice, very user-friendly. There’s no obvious downside, although I haven’t had a chance to really observe them over the same time periods as I have with National Instruments for over 20 years. But I have very high hopes for these systems, and we’re using them as standard now. The only situation where we’re not using them at the moment is when we have to count photons, because the data acquisition speed is currently 125 MHz max on the vDAQ. But there will be a new vDAQ version coming out later this year, with high-speed acquisition that will then be suitable for photon counting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I see. Maybe, to finish up, some fun questions… or maybe not so much fun, let’s see. During your time at INSS, what was your most challenging project?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the first microscopes we built was in Okinawa, Japan. Shipping all the microscope parts to Okinawa was a bit of a challenge. Three of the four boxes arrived without problem, but the box with my toolkit didn’t arrive and was completely lost for about a week or so. UPS didn’t know where it was. They had scanned it in Tokyo, but then lost track of it and had absolutely no idea where it was. I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too. I had lots of spare parts in the toolkit, and all sorts of specialist tools that were difficult to replace in the shortness of time. That was a challenge to my otherwise unshakable optimism … In the end, the toolkit did arrive and everything was fine; I built the microscope, no problem with that. But then I needed to ship the toolkit back, and UPS kept cancelling the booking and no one on the customer service hotline knew why. We eventually shipped it back with Fedex. It was all very annoying, and I then decided to get a shipping agent who’s now managing all of our shipping for us, and he’s been brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, this sounds like a rough start…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes … having these useful conversations with UPS customer service … It makes my blood boil just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;What was the most expensive device you destroyed by accident?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t really know, I don’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; You never destroyed an objective?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I never destroyed an objective, never destroyed a laser; I’ve destroyed scan mirrors, ETLs, stuff like that, probably a few other items in that price range. But I move on from that pretty quickly. I always think of it as a tuition fee that I have to pay, and then I forget about the incident. But the knowledge of what not to do stays with me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Which skill do you wish you have learned earlier that would be of use for your current job?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Hm, all of them! I would love to have university degrees in electronic engineering and optical physics and project management, computer science, business administration, and applied math. Almost every technical thing or business thing that you could learn at a university would be in some way useful to my current job. But I also have to be realistic about how much I can do with the available time. These disciplines have crossed my path sort of superficially, and I’ve picked up what I can. I wish I had a really solid foundation in all of them, but I have to live with my limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;This sounds quite modest, given your expertise in so many domains… if you had to pick one, what would you learn if you had one year for that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably math. I’d really like to go back to undergraduate level math and learn all the foundations properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; From your long experience in research and as a consultant, what kind of advice would you give to students or postdocs who want to learn the skills which are needed to understand a microscope or, more generally, to set up experiments?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; You just have to start, just go and do it. If you want to set up a microscope, go online, google “how to set up a microscope”, and then click your way to the websites where you can find how to set up a microscope. Maybe someone recommends to go to a course, maybe someone recommends a particular Youtube video. You’ll find all the resources that you need. This is such a great time to be alive, because you can find everything that you need online. You can apply for courses like the CSHL course that we discussed about, or TENSS, or numerous other imaging courses. If you don’t get into any of those courses, you can still learn it all online and just start building. A lot of people now offer very simple 3D-printed parts to set up basic optics and teach yourself the skills. You don’t even have to wait until you’re a student or a postdoc, you can do that as a little school project when you’re 12 years old, because all the learning resources are online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you would encourage self-learning, because that’s the way to learn what you have learned yourself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s one way that works for me. Other people have different working styles, and your own working style emerges when you start doing something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; What would be your advice for young scientists like PhD candidates or postdocs who think about a career like yours?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat; if you work more like an artist or an artisan and just focus on improving whatever your chosen art or your chosen craft is, then you’re going to get good at it, and then you’ll enjoy doing it. And if you keep an open mind, intriguing opportunities will pop up. And if you pursue these opportunities whenever they present themselves, then you’ll end up with the very tortuous career trajectory that I have, that doesn’t seem to make any obvious sense from outside. But for me, internally, it had a very natural flow. You’re obviously also going to need a massive amount of good luck; but I don’t really have any advice on how to get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a side note, for anyone who’s considering starting their own business or doing something on their own, there’s an old blog post written by a banjo player called Danny Barnes. He writes about how to make a living by playing music (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music&quot;&gt;https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music&lt;/a&gt;), and while the blog post is ostensibly about music, there’s a lot of advice that applies to any self-employed person, not just musicians; and also not just to self-employed people, it applies to anyone who is in some way in a largely self-directed job – which I guess is the case for most scientists. There are a few paragraphs in there that are more specific to music, but I think it’s just a very good read on how you want to conduct business and life with other people and make a living from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m curious, and I’ll check it out! … I think it has become obvious by now that you’re a big music aficionado. On Twitter, you describe yourself, among others, as ‘Bluegrass Dobroist’. Could you explain this to somebody without any clue, like myself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;A Dobro is an American instrument, it’s like an acoustic guitar that has an aluminium resonator cone built into the body. Originally, it was invented to make a normal guitar louder, a bit like a speaker cone that picks up the vibrations from the strings and projects them outward. The Dobro was invented in the 1920s to make the guitar &lt;em&gt;a little bit&lt;/em&gt; louder to be heard over orchestras, and it was kind of popular for a few years, until someone invented an electric guitar that you could just very easily make &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; louder, and then the Dobro fell into obscurity. It’s played in a lap style, and you’re not fretting the strings with your fingers like on a normal guitar, but you use a steel bar that slides up and down the strings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Since I did not fully understand the following explanations, he pulls out a Dobro and simply shows to me via video how it works to play a Dobro.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;And what is the meaning of ‘bluegrass’?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Bluegrass originally comes from the American state of Kentucky. Kentucky has a certain type of grass that has a sort of a blue appearance, and that’s why Kentucky is called the bluegrass state. There was a band in the 1940s that came from Kentucky; the band leader was called Bill Monroe and this band was called the Bluegrass Boys. Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys played a very new and unique style of acoustic country music, and then other people started copying that style, and eventually because of the name of the band the style became known as Bluegrass music, and that evolved into a whole genre of music. Now, there’s tons of bluegrass bands, and bluegrass music, bluegrass festivals, and there’s a Grammy for bluegrass music. So, from this one band in the 1940s a very huge branch of music has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Bruno Pichler and the Hot Rock Pilgrims.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Interesting, I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be most happy to talk a lot more about bluegrass music all day long! I love it – I’ve been really involved in this scene for the last 12 years or so, going to festivals almost every weekend – obviously not now with the pandemic, and generally a little less since I started the company and since we had a baby two years ago. I’ve got a lot of other things to do now, but I’m still very much connected to the whole music scene and to the guys in the band and all that. Sometimes during the time when I worked at Scientifica, I was playing five, six, seven gigs a month even though I was living here in East Sussex and drove an hour and a half or two hours into London after work to play gigs and come back during the night to be back at Scientifica in the morning…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;At the end, is there anything else you want to share?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to give a quick shout-out to my team, Angelos, Eleanor, Mark and Simon, who are just a massive pleasure to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if people want any sort of clarification on the things that I’ve mentioned, if people are thinking about transitioning from academia to industry and there are questions popping up, send me an email or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be quite happy to answer questions and give advice!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you. I think you gave already a lot of good advice here!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m glad to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv.org blog: Update: TeX Live 2020 Release October 1, 2020</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=666</guid>
	<link>https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/24/tex-live-2020-release-oct-1-2020/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The arXiv development team is pleased to announce a major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which is based on the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;TeX Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; update. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/tex&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt; is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update, set to release on October 1, 2020, provides enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team also used this opportunity to address bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors should be aware that works submitted between now and September 30, 2020 must adhere to current arXiv TeX guidelines (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/faq/#tex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Works prepared in accordance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;TeX Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; are welcome starting after 8am EDT on October 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex&quot;&gt;TeX has many advantages&lt;/a&gt; that make it ideal for the archives: it is plain text, compact, and freely available for all platforms, and it also produces high-quality output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Simultaneous calcium imaging and extracellular recording from the same neuron</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/?p=6527</guid>
	<link>https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/simultaneous-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-recording-from-the-same-neuron/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record from many neurons simultaneously. But what do the recorded signals really mean?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This question can only be properly addressed by experiments which record both calcium signals and action potentials from the same neuron (ground truth recordings). These recordings are technically quite challenging. So we assembled several existing ground truth datasets, and in addition recorded ground truth datasets ourselves, totaling &amp;gt;200 neuronal recordings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog blog posts contains raw movies together with recorded action potentials (black; also turn on your speakers for the spikes!) and the recorded ΔF/F of the calcium recording (blue). These ground truth data are a very direct way for everybody into calcium imaging to get an intuition about what is really going on. (Scroll down if you want to see recordings in zebrafish!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recording from a L2/3 neuron in visual cortex with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(Emx1), from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788802v1&quot;&gt;Huang et al., bioRxiv, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; a very beautiful recording. Replayed with 2x speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

Note that single action potentials don’t seem to have any impact at all. – The negative transients in the calcium trace stem from center-surround neuropil decontamination (activity of the surround is subtracted).&lt;/p&gt;

From the left, you can see the shadow of the patch pipette used for recording of extracellular signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something completely different: recording from a pyramidal neuron in Ca3 with &lt;strong&gt;R-CaMP1.07&lt;/strong&gt;, virally induced, recorded by Stefano Carta, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. What appears as single events are actually bursts of 5-15 action potentials with inter-spike-intervals of &amp;lt;6 ms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recording that I performed myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (aDp) with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(neuroD), in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Around second 20, it is visible that even a single action potential can be seen in the calcium signal. However,this was not always the case in other neurons that I recorded from the same brain region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again a recording that I did in adult zebrafish, in the dorsal part of the dorsal telencephalon with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(neuroD), in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt; Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What can you do if you want to detect single isolated action potentials with calcium imaging? GCaMP, due to its sigmoid non-linearity, is by often a bad choice and will be strongly biased towards bursts. Synthetic indicators, however, are very linear in the low-calcium regime. – This is a recording that I did myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator &lt;strong&gt;OGB-1&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Although the temporal resolution of the calcium recording is rather low, the indicator clearly responds to single action potentials. As another asset, the indicator not only fills the cytoplasm of the neuron in a ring-like shape, which makes neuropil-contamination much less of an issue compared to GCaMPs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another recording that I performed in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator &lt;strong&gt;Cal-520&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This indicator is much more sensitive compared to OGB-1, but also diffuses less well after bolus injection. – These two minutes of recording only contain 4 spikes (this brain region really is into low firing rates in general), but you can clearly see all of them. If this were a GCaMP recording, you would probably see only a flat line throughout the entire recording.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bits of DNA: The lethal nonsense of Michael Levitt</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/?p=14497</guid>
	<link>https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/09/21/the-lethal-nonsense-of-michael-levitt/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not easy when people start listening to all the nonsense you talk. Suddenly, there are many more opportunities and enticements than one can ever manage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Michael Levitt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/levitt/biographical/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990 Glendon MacGregor, a restaurant waiter in Pretoria, South Africa, set up an elaborate hoax in which he posed as the crown prince of Liechtenstein to organize for himself a state visit to his own country. Amazingly, the ruse lasted for two weeks, and during that time MacGregor was wined and dined by numerous South African dignitaries. He had a blast in his home town, living it up in a posh hotel, and enjoying a trip to see the Blue Bulls in Loftus Versfeld stadium. The story is the subject of  the 1993 Afrikaans film “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438954/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Die Prins van Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;” (The Prince of Pretoria). Now, another Pretorian is at it, except this time not for two weeks but for several months. And, unlike MacGregor’s hoax, this one does not just embarrass a government and leave it with a handful of hotel and restaurant bills. This hoax risks lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Levitt&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford University Professor of structural biology and winner of  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013, wants you to believe the COVID-19 pandemic is over in the US. He claimed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1287036738565738496?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ended on August 22nd, with a total of 170,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt; (there are now over 200,000 with hundreds of deaths per day). He claims those 170,000 deaths &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1262799080402628608?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weren’t even COVID-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, and since &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdnwp.tonyrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EuroMOMO_Influenza_and_COVID19_Have_Similar_Total_and_Age_Range_Excess_Deaths.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the virus is not very dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, he suggests you infect yourself. How? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1278561306006691845?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He proposes you set sail on a COVID-19 cruise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Sea world's largest cruise ship under  construction - Business Insider&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://i.insider.com/5f5a54307ed0ee001e25e8b1?width=1100&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; width=&quot;503&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt’s lunacy began with an attempt to save the world from epidemiologists. Levitt presumably figured this would not be a difficult undertaking, because, he has noted, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gummibear737/status/1279167888038023170?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;epidemiologists see their job not as getting things correct&lt;/a&gt;“. I guess he figured that he could do better than &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; On&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt; February 25th of this year, at a time when there had already been 2,663 deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China but before the World Health Organization had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, he delivered what sounded like good news. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/25/WS5e545c76a310128217279f34.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He predicted that the virus had almost run its course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, and that the final death toll in China would be 3,250. This turned out to be a somewhat optimistic prediction. As of the writing of this post (September 21, 2020), there have been 4,634 reported COVID-19 deaths in China, and there is reason to believe that the actual number of deaths has been far higher (see, e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116012v2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30089-X/fulltext&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tsang et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wadham and Jacobs, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of publishing his methods or waiting to evaluate the veracity of his claims, Levitt signed up for multiple media interviews. Emboldened by “interest in his work” (who doesn’t want to interview a Nobel laureate?), he started making more predictions of the form “COVID-19 is not a threat and the pandemic is over”. On March 20th he said that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/nobel-laureate-israel-will-have-no-more-than-ten-coronavirus-deaths-621407&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he will be surprised if the number of deaths in Israel surpasses 10&lt;/a&gt;“. Unfortunately, there have been 1,256 COVID-19 deaths in Israel so far with a massive increase in cases over the past few weeks and no end to the pandemic in sight. On March 28th, when Switzerland had 197 deaths, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243929765876301825?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;predicted the pandemic was almost over and would end with 250&lt;/a&gt;. Switzerland are now seen 1,762 deaths and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.ch/20200915/worst-infection-rate-in-switzerland-vaud-to-introduce-new-lockdown-measures-from-thursday&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent dramatic increase in cases has overwhelmed hospitals in some regions leading to new lockdown measures&lt;/a&gt;. Levitt’s predictions have come loose and fast. On June 28th &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1277278261979090945?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he predicted deaths in Brazil would plateau at 98,000&lt;/a&gt;. There have been over 137,000 deaths in Brazil with hundreds of people dying every day now. In Italy he predicted on March 28th that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243905625714831363?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the pandemic was past its midpoint and deaths would end at 17,000 – 20,000.&lt;/a&gt; There have now been 35,707 deaths in Italy. The way he described the situation in the country at the time, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/surprising-reason-northern-italy-crematoria-are-overwhelmed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crematoria were overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt;, was “normal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of Levitt’s predictions via an email list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/iscb-fellows&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fellows of the International Society of Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt; on March 14th. I’ve been a Fellow for 3 years, and during this time I’ve received hardly any mail, except during Fellow nomination season. It was therefore somewhat of a surprise to start receiving emails from Michael Levitt regarding COVID-19, but it was a time when scientists were scrambling to figure out how they could help with the pandemic and I was excited at the prospect of all of us learning from each other and possibly helping out. Levitt began by sending around a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/am2437ywxnh4b84/CURRENT.Analysis_of_Coronavirus-2019_Data_Michael_Levitt.pdf?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF via a Dropbox link&lt;/a&gt; and asked for feedback. I wrote back right away suggesting he distribute the code used to make the figures, make clear the exact versions of data he was scraping to get the results (with dates and copies so the work could be replicated), suggested he add references and noted there were several typos (e.g. the formula &lt;img alt=&quot;D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_n+%3D+C_nP_0+%2B+C_%7Bn-1%7DP_1+%2B+C_%7Bn-2%7DP_2+%2B+%5Cldots+%2B+C_%7Bn-29%7DP_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2&quot; /&gt; clearly had wrong indices). I asked that he post it on the bioRxiv so it could receive community feedback, and suggested he fill in some details so I and others could better evaluate the methods (e.g. I pointed out that I thought the use of a Gaussian for &lt;img alt=&quot;P_n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;P_n&quot; /&gt; was problematic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial correspondence rapidly turned into a flurry of email on the ISCB Fellows list. Levitt was full of advice. He suggested everyone wear a mask and I and others pushed back noting, as Dr. Anthony Fauci did at the time, that there was a severe shortage of masks and they should go to doctors first. Several exchanges centered on who to blame for the pandemic (one Fellow suggested immigrants in Italy). Among all of this, there was one constant: Levitt’s COVID-19 advice and predictions kept on coming, and without reflection or response to the well-meaning critiques. After Levitt said he’d be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths in Israel, and after he refused to send code reproducing his analyses, or post a preprint, I urged my fellow Fellows in ISCB to release a statement distancing our organization from his opinions, and emphasizing the need for rigorous, reproducible work. I was admonished by two colleagues and told, in so many words, to shut up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Levitt did not shut up. In March, after talking to Israeli newspapers about how he would be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-expert-who-says-israel-is-overreacting-to-coronavirus-1.8689010&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he spoke directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; to deliver his message that Israel was overreacting to the virus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ioannidis-trump-white-house-coronavirus-lockdowns&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he tried to speak to US president Donald Trump as well&lt;/a&gt;). Israel is now in a very dangerous situation with COVID-19 out of control. It has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-highest-rate-in-world-of-new-coronavirus-infections-per-capita-tv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highest number of cases per capita in the world&lt;/a&gt;. Did Levitt play a role in this by helping to convince Netanyahu to ease restrictions in the country in May? We may never know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1301637529406496770?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There were likely many factors&lt;/a&gt; contributing to Israel’s current tragedy but Levitt, by virtue of speaking directly to Netanyahu, should be scrutinized for his actions. What we do know is that at the time, he was making predictions about the nature and expected course of the virus with unpublished methods (i.e. not even preprinted), poorly documented data, and without any possibility for anyone to reproduce any of his work. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;His disgraceful scholarship has not improved in the subsequent months. He did, eventually post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;, but the data tab states “all data to be made available” and there is the following paragraph relating to availability of code: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to make the computer codes we use available to all but these are currently written in a variety of languages that few would want to use. While Dr. Scaiewicz uses clean self-documenting Jupyter Python notebook code, Dr. Levitt still develops in a FORTRAN dialect call Mortran (Mortran 1975) that he has used since 1980. The Mortran preprocessor produces Fortran that is then converted to C-code using f2c. This code is at least a hundred-fold faster than Python code. His other favorite language is more modern, but involves the use of the now deprecated language Perl and Unix shell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the methods proposed here are simple; they are easily and quickly implemented by a skilled programmer. Should there be interest, we would be happy to help others develop the code and test them against ours. We also realize that there is ample room for code optimization. Some of the things that we have considered are pre-calculating sums of terms to convert computation of the correlation coefficient from a sum over N terms to the difference of two sums. Another way to speed the code would be to use hierarchical step sizes in a binary search to find the value of lnN that gives the best straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involving as it did a small group working in different time zones and under extreme time pressure revealed that scientific computation nowadays faces a Babel of computer languages. In some ways this is good as we generally re-coded things rather than struggle with the favorite language of others. Still, we worry about the future of science when so many different tools are used. In this work we used Python for data wrangling and some plotting, Perl and Unix shell tools for data manipulation, Mortran (effectively C++) for the main calculations, xmgrace and gnuplot for other plotting, Excel (and Openoffice) for playing with data. And this diversity is for a group of three!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr, there is no code. I’ve asked Michael Levitt repeatedly for the code to reproduce the figures in his paper and have not received it. I can’t reproduce his plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mlevitt_np2013/status/1254853253457539072?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Levitt now lies when confronted about his misguided and wrong prediction about COVID-19 in Israel&lt;/a&gt;. He claims it is a “red herring”, and that he was talking about “excess deaths”. I guess he figures he can hide behind Hebrew. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NuritBaytch/status/1256734540015587329?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There is a recording&lt;/a&gt; where anyone can hear him being asked directly if he is saying he will be surprised with more than 10 COVID-19 deaths in Israel, and his answers is very clear: “I will be very surprised”. It is profoundly demoralizing to discover that a person you respected is a liar, a demagogue or worse. Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this has happened to me before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt continues to put people’s lives at risk by spewing lethal nonsense. He is suggesting that we should let COVID-19 spread in the population so it will mutate to be less harmful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1307795936924577792?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This is nonsense&lt;/a&gt;. He is promoting anti-vax conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1307634991325753344?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that are nonsense&lt;/a&gt;. He is promoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1305791799492071425?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonsense conspiracy theories about scientists&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122618622/nobel-prize-winner-weighs-in-on-nzs-covid-strategy-from-a-poolside-in-portugal&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he continues to have a prominent voice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not hard to see why. The article, similar to all the others where he is interviewed, begins with “Nobel Prize winner…”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the Talmud, in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9, it is written “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world”. I thought of this when listening to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aier.org/article/nobel-laureate-michael-levitt-on-the-lockdowns-i-think-it-is-a-huge-mistake/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Michael Levitt&lt;/a&gt; that took place in May, where he said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a real baby-boomer, I was born in 1947, and I think we’ve really screwed up. We cause pollution, we allowed the world’s population to increase three-fold, we’ve caused the problems of global warming, we’ve left your generation with a real mess in order to save a really small number of very old people. If I was a young person now, I would say, “now you guys are gonna pay for this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Person wearing a VR headset&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12117 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/VR-300x159.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching a Virtual Reality video was found to be an effective decision-making aid for people making an advance care plan. Advance care planning offers people the opportunity to plan their future care and support, including medical treatment, while they have the capacity to do so. Legislation allowing advance care planning is relatively new in Asia and has been recently introduced in Taiwan. Taiwanese people must complete a consultation before formally documenting their wishes. However, health and legal literacy can be a barrier to people making fully-informed decisions about their future care. Wan-Ting Hsieh showed 120 people a short video in virtual reality that documented typical scenarios in end-of-life care, such as hospice home care and the withdrawal of life support. After viewing the video, participant’s preferences for not accessing the medical treatments shown and the ability to make a decision about their future care increased. The study provides evidence for how VR tools could be further rolled out as decision-making aids and bridge gaps in health and legal literacy for important decisions about their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09293-1&quot;&gt;Changes in sedentary behaviour in European Union adults between 2002 and 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Watching TV&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12115 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Sedentary-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Sedentary behaviors rose between 2002 and 2017 in the European Union, particularly in men. Sedentary behavior is an important risk factor for mortality and continues to be a public health challenge with significant health, social and economic consequences. López-Valenciano &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;analyzed data that surveyed European Union adult citizen’s physical activity and sedentary behaviors. In 2002, half of those surveyed were inactive for more than 4.5 hours each day; by 2017 this had risen to 54.5%. The researchers suggested a number of factors could account for this increase in sedentary behavior, such as longer commutes and labor-saving devices at home and work. The authors also attributed people’s interaction with technology such as smartphones and streaming services with increasing physical inactivity. The study provides supporting data for strengthening public health policies and international efforts to tackle rises in sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-06940-0&quot;&gt;Analyses of key genes involved in Arctic adaptation in polar bears suggest selection on both standing variation and de novo mutations played an important role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Polar bear&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12114 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Polar-bear-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Genomic mechanisms behind the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments have been revealed. Polar bears rapidly evolved several traits from its closest living relative, the brown bear, that has promoted the species’ survival in arctic environments. Castruita &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;studied the genomic mechanisms underpinning how these characteristics were selected in polar bears by analyzing the genomes of more than 100 polar bears and 33 brown bears. The analysis revealed that a combination of standing variation in ancestral gene pools and &lt;em&gt;de novo &lt;/em&gt;mutations in polar bear lineages may have promoted the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments. The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the genomic mechanisms behind how polar bears rapidly adapted to the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05340-9&quot;&gt;Improving the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19: examining the factors that influence engagement and the impact on individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;People wearing masks at a bus stop&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12116 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Social-distancing-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Community compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions in a pandemic may be influenced by the perceived severity of illness in the community. In an effort to flatten peaks of COVID-19 infections, governments have introduced various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, lockdowns, and the use of face-coverings. However, how much of a positive impact these interventions have relies on community understanding, engagement, and compliance. Seale &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;conducted a rapid review of the literature to study the factors that impact community engagement with government interventions. The emerging theme identified by the review was how can an environment be created that supports and promotes the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the community? The authors suggest integrating community co-design of supporting communications and materials to promote engagement and compliance with interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01094-9&quot;&gt;Protocol registration issues of systematic review and meta-analysis studies: a survey of global researchers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Person wearing a yellow jumper typing on a laptop&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12118 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Working-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Almost half of systematic review and meta-analysis authors have never registered the protocol for their study a survey finds. Registering a systematic review protocol promotes transparency, prevents bias, and duplication of work. Cochrane and other bodies recommend prospectively registering systematic review protocols but journals do not mandate it, contrasting with their registration requirements for clinical trials. Tawfik &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;surveyed 270 systematic review and meta-analysis authors to assess researchers’ knowledge and attitudes towards systematic review protocol registration. Survey respondents acknowledged a lack of knowledge surrounding obligation and importance about protocol registration. The study calls for collaborative efforts to raise awareness of the benefits of systematic review protocol registration in the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: What influences NHS Health Check behaviors?</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/PHE-1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)&quot;&gt;number 1 cause of death&lt;/a&gt; globally, with an estimated 17.7 million people having died from CVD conditions in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths. In England in 2017, more than 124,000 people died from CVD&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Changing behaviors related to diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake can reduce CVD risk. The delivery of interventions targeting these behaviors also often requires healthcare professional (HCP) behaviors to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NHS Health Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS Health Check (NHSHC), introduced in the English National Health Service (NHS) in 2009, is a national prevention program offered to adults 40-74 years old with the aim of helping them reduce their chance of having a heart attack or stroke through behavior change and, where appropriate, clinical treatment. Since then, national evaluations have highlighted the need to maximize the program’s impact by improving coverage and outputs. To address these challenges, it is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway and encourage the promotion or minimization of behavioral facilitators and barriers respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date research has tended to focus on single populations, e.g. patients or GPs, and specific behaviors, e.g. attending an NHS Health Check. A synthesis of these studies would provide an overarching behavioral picture of those involved in delivery and receipt of NHS Health Checks and so provide the foundations for intervention refinement and development. Our goal was to apply behavioral science frameworks to: i) identify behaviors and actors relevant to uptake, delivery and follow up of NHS Health Checks and influences on these behaviors and ii) signpost to example intervention content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 37 studies reporting nine behaviors and influences for eight of these. The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity. Other key influences were motivational, such as beliefs about consequences about the value of NHS Health Checks and behavior change, and social, such as influences of others on behavior change. The following techniques are suggested for websites or smartphone apps: Adding objects to the environment, e.g. provide HCPs with electronic schedules to guide timely delivery of Health Checks to target physical opportunity, Social support (unspecified), e.g. include text suggesting patients to ask a colleague to agree in advance to join them in taking the ‘healthy option’ lunch at work; Information about health consequences, e.g. quotes and/or videos from patients talking about the health benefits of changes they have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the recommendations flowing from our findings reflect the types of interventions that we would expect on theoretical grounds to be effective, and this is not a review of effectiveness of interventions. Additional work needs to be done to investigate the extent to which interventions to promote NHS Health Check behaviors target the barriers and facilitators identified in this review. This work would identify any missed opportunities for intervention and inform intervention design and refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations for commissioners and providers, which should be considered as part of the forthcoming NHS Health Check review in order to ensure the program is implemented as effectively as possible for the next 10 years and beyond.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: Transparency and Trust: Peer Review Week 2020</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18391</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/GycEZabM7cM/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is written by PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer Veronique Kiermer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer Review Week is a time to celebrate the outstanding work of reviewers across the scholarly ecosystem. But it also serves as a call to action to examine the systems we have in place and opportunities to improve. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This peer review week, the theme couldn’t feel more timely. Trust in science, and peer review more specifically has taken the spotlight as doctors, researchers, and policymakers around the world collaborate to rapidly expand and communicate emerging knowledge about COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the advent of preprints in biomedical sciences has created &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux&quot;&gt;new challenges&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate findings outside the traditional framework of journal peer review, and high profile journal retractions have contributed to raise doubts about the effectiveness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/&quot;&gt;pre-publication peer review&lt;/a&gt;. With the flood of information pouring in, public readers and researchers alike face the same question: how do I identify information I can trust? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Peer Review Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer review has long been a staple of the credibility of scientific findings for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206&quot;&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pewrsr.ch/2Hgq31S&quot;&gt;the public&lt;/a&gt;.  The process embodies the norm of organized skepticism that helps generate trust in scientific findings—by testing the rigor of thinking and experimentation, and by providing authors with expert feedback to build on. But importantly, peer review is more than the traditional view of pre-publication peer review conducted behind closed doors. Peer review does not stop with publication—in many ways, it only starts there. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen researchers rapidly come together &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the publication of high-stake results and point out serious methodological flaws which have led to retractions of articles and withdrawals of preprints. Social media has been an unconventional, yet instrumental tool in coordinated reactions. Some have argued this is a failure of peer review, but we believe it’s actually a celebration of peer review in different forms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broader view of peer review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While post-publication peer review remains rare, preprints offer new opportunities to leverage the community in order to address the challenges and limitations of traditional peer review. For example, reviewers and editors commonly acknowledge that it is increasingly difficult to cover all the bases of expertise required to properly analyze articles that have become much more multidisciplinary. Preprint commenting while the article is under review is one possible solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;we’ve encouraged&lt;/a&gt; to address this gap, by opening up the opportunity for any researcher, anywhere in the world to volunteer their expertise, for consideration by the editor. While commenting on preprints is still rare, it could allow journals to channel within the traditional process the energy that the community already puts in scrutinizing new findings within their specialty before they are formally published in journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preprints and preprint commenting can also help with another challenge of journal review: speed. PLOS journals offer authors the option to post preprints on their behalf at submission—after minimal checks for any content with potential to cause harm—so their findings can be disseminated while the journal curation process takes place.  We also participate in initiatives like Review Commons to provide journal-agnostic reviews that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/&quot;&gt;accelerate the peer review process&lt;/a&gt; at the author’s destination journal and alleviate the strain of repeated reviews on the peer reviewer community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond these practical issues, we must consider systemic challenges and in particular the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/400515v1&quot;&gt;documented biases&lt;/a&gt; in peer review. At PLOS we acknowledge the need to improve the diversity of our reviewer pool to help mitigate such biases and we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;committed to this work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency, transparency, transparency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important prerequisite for all peer review mechanisms to work as effectively as they can is transparency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency facilitates trust. Working to make every step of the research and publication process as Open as possible gives journals, peer reviewers, and the scholarly community more broadly, the means for scrutiny, and a clear understanding of limitations. At the same time, it gives readers deeper insight into the scientific process and the various checkpoints that uphold it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an author’s perspective, increasing transparency means making all relevant data, code, methodologies, and reagents available so that the scholarly community—starting with reviewers—can validate and reproduce the findings independently. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/kabux/&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Center for Open Science indicated that researchers judging preprint credibility were influenced by cues related to open data, code and other openness measures, as well as independent verification of authors claims. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Publishing peer review reports as well is important as it makes evident what aspects of the article were (and were not) thoroughly scrutinized pre-publication. All PLOS journals now encourage their authors to publish their peer review history alongside the article, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/&quot;&gt;uptake is promising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer review needs better recognition &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency in peer review is also crucial to recognizing peer review as a first-rate academic output. It is time for this activity, essential to the scientific process, to be considered a scientific output in its own right and to take its due place in the context of research and researchers assessment. With published peer review reports, individual reviewers can choose to take credit by revealing their identity. But recognizing that there are circumstances that call for anonymity, even unnamed reviewers should have this opportunity, and tools like ORCID and Publons allow them to demonstrate their contributions as part of their academic profile. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s always more we can do to provide the motivation and support for reviewers’ work. Peer review transparency and other visual signs of recognition are a way to start helping researchers leverage their  peer review expertise to advance their careers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earning trust in peer review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, the traditional journal peer review process offers important opportunities to ensure fairness in peer review. And journals have a collective responsibility to make use of these opportunities. First and foremost, we can ensure that every paper reporting a rigorously designed and executed study is peer reviewed—not only the high-stakes findings and the work of well known authors. We can also take proactive measures to limit bias, such as increasing the diversity of reviewer pools, and managing competing interests. We can foster consistent review criteria, and supplement the volunteer peer review reports with additional scrutiny for elements like statistics or ethical research practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sum, I believe there are complementary benefits of journal-organized peer review and the process that can take place more organically in the research community post-publication—whether the publication is in a journal or on a preprint server. With more transparency in the system, we can take advantage of all mechanisms of peer review to decide what to trust, and importantly peer review itself can deserve our trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is a small collection of neurons situated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#ventral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ventral&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., below the thalamus). It is a major component of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subthalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subthalamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the subthalamic nucleus and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is considered part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;. The basal ganglia are a group of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subcortical&lt;/a&gt; nuclei that are involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions, but are best known for their role in movement. The precise contributions of the basal ganglia to movement still aren’t fully understood, but one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia play a critical role in facilitating desired movements, while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is considered a critical component of basal ganglia circuits that are devoted to the suppression of unwanted movements. These inhibitory circuits are known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;indirect pathway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hyperdirect-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hyperdirect pathway&lt;/a&gt;. In both pathways, the inhibition of movement is thought to be traceable back to excitatory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/glutamate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;glutamate &lt;/a&gt;neurons that extend from the subthalamic nucleus to stimulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt; neurons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;; these GABA neurons in turn exert an inhibitory influence over neurons in the thalamus that typically prompt movement when they’re excited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this video to learn more about the indirect pathway, a circuit in the basal ganglia that includes the subthalamic nucleus and is thought to play an important role in the inhibition of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus’ role in suppressing unwanted movements may be critical even for the simplest movements. If, for example, you are reaching out to pick up a cup of coffee, your brain must not only activate the muscles necessary for the movement, but inhibit those that would counteract the desired movement. Indeed, even when you are sitting still, unwanted movements (like your hand jerking involuntarily up in the air) must continuously be subdued by your brain. It has been hypothesized that the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in these types of movement inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important to note, however, that the functions of the subthalamic nucleus (and basal ganglia as a whole) are not limited to movement. Recent research suggests the subthalamic nucleus may also contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive functions like decision-making, attention, and working memory&lt;/a&gt; (among others). And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subthalamic nucleus may be part of circuits that have important influences on emotion&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of our understanding of these more extensive roles for the subthalamic nucleus come from studies involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-brain-stimulation-dbs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, or DBS. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting an electrode in the brain. Once the electrode is in place, it can be prompted to emit electrical impulses that are hypothesized to interfere with neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;DBS has been found to be especially useful in the treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by movement problems like slow, effortful movement, and difficulty initiating movements. It is believed that some of these movement-related symptoms stem from overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus. This increased subthalamic nucleus activity may lead to excessive inhibition of movement via the basal ganglia circuits mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thus, when the electrode in DBS is positioned in or near the subthalamic nucleus, turning the device on can disrupt the inhibitory actions of the subthalamic nucleus and facilitate movement. To learn more about DBS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog//deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease-mechanism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, the use of DBS has also helped us to appreciate the complexity of the roles of the subthalamic nucleus. Many patients who receive DBS experience not only an improvement of their Parkinsonian symptoms, but also develop side effects that include cognitive and emotional changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like memory disturbances and apathy&lt;/a&gt;. It has been proposed that disruption of the function of the subthalamic nucleus might be responsible for these side effects of DBS. It should be said, however, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;variability in the side effects of DBS&lt;/a&gt;—as well as a poor understanding of exactly how DBS affects brain activity—makes it difficult to say this with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Regardless, the evidence collected to date suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is an important area of the brain for motor control and a variety of other actions. Future research will be needed, however, to fully understand the functions of this small—but important—collection of neurons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonnevie T, Zaghloul KA.

	<title>Peter Rupprecht: Discrepancies between calcium imaging and extracellular ephys recordings</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/?p=6578</guid>
	<link>https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To record the activity from a  population of neurons, calcium imaging and extracellular recordings with small electrodes are the two most widely used methods that are still  able to disentangle the contributions from single units. Here, I would like to briefly mention two papers that try to connect these two approaches by comparing them more or less directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wei et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1&quot;&gt;A comparison of neuronal population dynamics measured with calcium imaging and electrophysiology&lt;/a&gt;, bioRxiv, 2019&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2020-09-15&lt;/strong&gt;: The paper just came out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198&quot;&gt;PLoS Comp Biology&lt;/a&gt; just one day after the blog post!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244723v1&quot;&gt;Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with two-photon imaging and electrophysiology&lt;/a&gt;, bioRxiv, 2020&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both papers compare calcium imaging datasets and extracellular ephys datasets, try to connect the results and point out the difficulties in reconciling the approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wei et al. &lt;/strong&gt;use datasets recorded in mouse anterio-lateral motor cortex (ALM). They first focus on approaches to reconstruct spike rates from calcium imaging data (deconvolution) and find several limitations of this approach. On the other hand, they find that a forward model that transforms spiking activity to calcium fluorescence data can reconcile most of these differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors also provide a user-friendly website which can be used to explore the transformations between ephys and imaging data (also including datasets with simultaneous ephys-imaging): &lt;a href=&quot;http://im-phys.org&quot;&gt;http://im-phys.org&lt;/a&gt;. (Understanding the figures of the paper is however quite useful before exploring the website.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6583&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6583&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;692,383&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33/&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=692&quot; width=&quot;670&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1&quot;&gt;Wei et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, used under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt; license (excerpt from Fig. 7).&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A large part of the paper focuses on high-level analyses (principal component analysis, decoding of behavior and decision). I would take it as an educational tale of caution which highlights wrong conclusions that could be made based on standard analyses. For example, the slow and variable decay times of calcium imaging data can lead to a dispersion of peak activity that was absent in the ephys data. This dispersion can smear out clearly timed activations of neuronal population into something more similar to a sequence (see Figure 7, of which I have pasted an excerpt above).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.&lt;/strong&gt; from the Allen Institute, rather than investigating the effects on higher-level population analyses, focus their attention on the effects seen in single neurons. When comparing a calcium imaging and an ephys dataset recorded in the same brain region (visual cortex V1) in mice that do the same standardized tasks, what differences can be seen in the firing properties of single neurons?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the high standardization requirements at the Allen Institute, their datasets are probably uniquely qualified to be the basis for such a comparison. Interestingly, they find a couple of clear differences. For example, extracellular ephys data suggest typical firing rates of around 3 Hz (see Figure 2A), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than what has been recorded and estimated from calcium imaging data (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Figure 7 in our preprint&lt;/a&gt;, which estimates spike rates of the same dataset).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors go to great lengths to use forward transformations (similar to Wei et al.) in order to reconcile differences seen for various response metrics (responsiveness, tuning preference, selectivity). However, their conclusion seemed to me quite a bit less optimistic compared to the Wei et al. paper. The authors go into more detail when discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancies, and focus on the recording methods themselves rather than on methods to transform between them. In particular their analysis of inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations in ephys recordings (which indicate that spikes from different neurons contaminate the recording of the neuron of interest) was, in my opinion, particularly interesting and convincing. I also really recommend to anybody the last paragraph of their discussion, from which I only want to cite their note of caution about extracellular ephys recordings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this study, we have learned that extracellular electrophysiology overestimates the fraction of neurons that elevate their activity in response to visual stimuli, in a manner that is consistent with the effects of selection bias and contamination. – Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I am writing about these two studies is that I have been working at the interface of calcium imaging and ephys myself, addressing the question, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;How much information about spike rates can we get out of calcium imaging data?&lt;/a&gt; Wei et al. and Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al. take a slightly broader perspective. And, in some way, they show how hard it is to reconcile two (methodological) perspectives on the same phenomenon. (I noticed this in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119&quot;&gt;PhD lab&lt;/a&gt; as well, when it came to reconciling results from EM reconstructions of neuronal anatomy and calcium measurements of the same neurons.) Since almost any method in systems neuroscience is technically challenging, we often have in a single lab only a single perspective of a phenomenon, and I think it’s important to always be aware that the conclusions drawn from this perspective might be strongly biased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, calcium imaging and extracellular ephys are extremely valuable tools to observe the living brain, and we better do anything to understand the properties and limitations of these tools. These studies sometimes might feel a bit like negative results and therefore not very attractive to those who want to advance neuroscience, and I therefore understand why not many are willing to undertake these projects. So I am glad to be able to highlight these two publications here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
