	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rebecca will be presenting the work she conducted for her master's thesis titled 'How the Olfactory Bulb processes naturalistic time-varying inputs'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb in mammals is responsible for receiving, processing and relaying olfactory
information (odours). This project investigates how naturalistic temporally fluctuating odour signals are
processed and which neurons or neural mechanisms are able to extract information from these signals.
Multiple computation models were created to represent different OB circuits between periglomerular
cells and mitral cells using NEURON (Hines and Carnevale, 2006, 2001). The results show that the
strength and frequency of these odour signals can be determined by looking at a combination of the
latency and the firing rates of the output from the mitral cells.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Marco Ortu, who is visiting for the week, will be giving the presentation 'Measuring Effectiveness and Affectiveness in Software Systems'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation highlights the results obtained in a four-years project aiming at analyzing the development process of software artifacts from two points of view: Effectiveness and Affectiveness. The first attribute is meant to analyze the productivity of the Open Source Communities by measuring the time required to resolve an issue, while the latter provides a novel approach for studying the development process by analyzing the affectiveness expressed by developers in their comments posted during the issue resolution.
Affectivenes is obtained by measuring Sentiment, Politeness and Emotions and other emotional state indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, researchers published a paper showing that an RNA molecule may be overactive in breast tumor tissue. But after reading the paper, three biologists believed the data supported the opposite conclusion. What happened after that is a tale of misunderstandings and unnecessarily bruised feelings. We’ve seen plenty of cases where researchers ignore criticism, which […]&lt;/p&gt;

The new paper followed the patients for a longer period of time, up to 24 months for some in the cohort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main portion of the trial was six months in length. All patients received implantation surgery. Two weeks later, they were randomized to either the treatment group (n=60), who received stimulation right away, or the “sham” control group (n=30), who did not. After six months, the blinding was uncovered and both sham and treatment groups were offered open label DBS for another six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the figure below, Control (red line) and Stimulation (blue line) groups both showed slight improvements over time, with no significant difference in depression severity measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). This was the primary endpoint. We don't see a difference between groups at six months or any other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BDd7kIGbqMk/WdyvKRgJHeI/AAAAAAAAMRw/hmd2FcTmo6o1_NRbJGHgS1jGg2YW_m1mQCLcBGAs/s1600/Mean%2BMADRS%2Bscore%2Bby%2Bstudy%2Bvisit.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;772&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1247&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BDd7kIGbqMk/WdyvKRgJHeI/AAAAAAAAMRw/hmd2FcTmo6o1_NRbJGHgS1jGg2YW_m1mQCLcBGAs/s400/Mean%2BMADRS%2Bscore%2Bby%2Bstudy%2Bvisit.png&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fig. 2.

I had erroneously stated in January 2014 that the trial was &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2014/01/broaden-trial-of-dbs-for-treatment.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;halted by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't. It was stopped by the sponsor, St. Jude Medical (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30371-1/fulltext&quot;&gt;Holtzheimer et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;For the futility analysis, based on the first 6 months' data, the  proportion of patients with response for the stimulation group was  predicted to be 40%, and for the control group was predicted to be  18·5%. In the actual futility analysis, these figures were 20% for the  stimulation group and 17% for the control group. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was concluded that the study had a 17% chance of success if continued. Although this did not meet the prespecified definition for futility (&amp;lt;10% chance of success), the sponsor chose to end study enrolment following the futility analysis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although “These findings are disappointing given the encouraging data from earlier open-label studies of subcallosal cingulate DBS,” all was not lost, according to the authors. They offered a number of possible explanations (which can be summarized as long duration of illness, suboptimal stimulation parameters, and lack of tractography):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“participants in this study had an average current episode duration of about 12 years, which is much longer than the average duration of current episode in previous studies of subcallosal cingulate DBS (approximately 5 years) and might have contributed to the low overall proportion of patients achieving a response.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“possible that stimulation contacts and parameters were suboptimal during the first 12 months of this study, given the somewhat restrictive programming algorithm used. Greater improvement in depression occurred after the 12-month endpoint when more flexibility in stimulation contacts and parameters was allowed.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Neurosurgical placement of the DBS electrodes, based on this algorithm, was highly accurate and did not differ between eventual responders and non-responders.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;[&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;placement was verified by at least two of three experts: HSM, CH, PEH. Nonetheless, the authors argue that placement could improve with more detailed tractography, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201759a.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Riva-Posse et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This refinement of protocol has been discussed for the last 10 years; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928332&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Johansen-Berg 2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2007/10/but-my-subgenual-cingulate-is-sad.html&quot;&gt;...But My Subgenual Cingulate Is Sad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“for maximal efficacy, the active electrode for subcallosal cingulate DBS must be placed such that it affects a crucial network of white matter tracts connecting key brain regions, including the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Therefore, it is possible that prospective targeting on the basis of individual diffusion tensor imaging tractography could optimise electrode placement in subcallosal cingulate DBS.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an earlier paper, a group of DBS investigators and ethics experts advised other researchers, industry mavens, and even bloggers on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159536&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Being open minded about neuromodulation trials: Finding success in our 'failures'&lt;/a&gt;.” (Finns et al., 2017)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Similarly, another randomized double blind clinical trial comparing active versus sham stimulation for the treatment of severe depression targeting Brodmann Area 25 was also halted for futility prior to completion of the planned study (St Jude Medical sponsored BROADEN trial). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;While there are neither publications nor official industry statements, uninformed speculations as to causes of the failure are in the public domain [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neurotechreports.com/pages/publishersletterDec13html&quot;&gt;28,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogsscientificamerican.com/cross-check/2014/03/11/much-hyped-brain-implant-treatment-for-depression-suffers-setback/&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;] to the detriment of the scientific process and progress.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each of these instances, different combinations of variables can lead to disappointing results. For example, patient characteristics, surgical variability, stimulation algorithms, outcome metrics, and institutional variance, can all contribute to negative outcomes in complex trials that initially seem promising. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Further, once a negative report is published, the work can become ‘toxic’, and there is little incentive to engage in small subset analyses that have a limited market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Finally,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“We believe that investigators, industry, regulators and society need to fully understand what is casually described as success and failure in order to maximize return on investment, all the more so when opportunities for additional knowledge generation remain in place. To do otherwise, would be irresponsible.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to call the BROADEN trial a failure is “irresponsible”? Personally, I am aware that a multi-site trial using invasive new technology to treat intractable psychiatric patients with a terrible and (ultimately) ill-defined syndrome is a massive undertaking. And very, very, very expensive. I have no problem with the investigators trying to glean what they can  from individual differences to move forward with better  targets/parameters/etc. I wanted to see this procedure help a majority of patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is that the primary preregistered endpoint was as follows: 12/60 (20%) improved with stimulation, 5/30 (17%) improved with no stimulation, 8/60 (12%) patients with stimulation reported an &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in depressive symptoms (this was not defined or quantified), and 1/30 (3%) patients with no stimulation reported an &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in depressive symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's take a look at the registered clinical trial. Oh we can't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00617162&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Trial of device that is not approved or cleared by the U.S. FDA] -- Wow!

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Ubiquitination and degradation of GBPs by a Shigella effector to suppress host defence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24467</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gd-4Tv5Y5dM/nature24467</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate cell-autonomous antimicrobial defenses1,2. Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative cytoplasmic free-living bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery3, encodes a repertoire of highly similar type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors called IpaHs4. IpaHs represent a large bacterial ubiquitin-ligase family5–8, but their function is poorly understood. Here we find that S. flexneri infection induced rapid proteasomal degradation of human GBP1 (hGBP1). A transposon screen identified ipaH9.8 as being responsible for the degradation. IpaH9.8 directly targeted hGBP1 for Lys48-linked ubiquitination. IpaH9.8 targeted multiple GBPs, which occurred in the cytoplasm independently of GBPs nucleotide-bound states as well as their differential function in antibacterial defence. When IpaH9.8 was absent or its binding to GBPs was disrupted, GBPs such as hGBP1 and mGBP2 translocated to intracellular S. flexneri to limit bacterial growth. IpaH9.8 targeting of GBPs promoted S. flexneri replication and caused lethality in mice. Gbpchr3-/- mice lacking several IpaH9.8-targeted GBPs succumbed to S. flexneri infection similarly to wild-type mice, but remained susceptible to ΔipaH9.8. The mode of IpaH9.8 action highlights the functional importance of GBPs in antibacterial defences. IpaH9.8 and S. flexneri provide a unique system for dissecting GBP-mediated immunity.

 This review commemorates the 40th anniversary of DNA sequencing, a period in which we have already witnessed multiple technological revolutions and a growth in scale from a few kilobases to the first human genome, and now to millions of human and a myriad of other genomes. DNA sequencing has been extensively and creatively repurposed, including as a ‘counter’ for a vast range of molecular phenomena. We predict that in the long view of history, the impact of DNA sequencing will be on a par with that of the microscope.

 Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The impact of rare variation on gene expression across tissues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24267</guid>

 Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans and are expected to contribute to individual disease risk. While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants. Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles, but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues, but their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44 human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p release. We find that 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8% of non-outliers. Additionally, we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Landscape of X chromosome inactivation across human tissues</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24265</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences transcription from one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is, however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of ‘escape’ from inactivation varying between genes and individuals. The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree to which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic survey of XCI, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues from GTEx (v6p release) and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic sequence data. We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape XCI with support from multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity. Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa since 1900</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Malaria transmission is influenced by climate, land use and deliberate interventions. Recent declines have been observed in malaria transmission. Here we show that the African continent has witnessed a long-term decline in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum from 40% prevalence in the period 1900–1929 to 24% prevalence in the period 2010–2015, a trend that has been interrupted by periods of rapidly increasing or decreasing transmission. The cycles and trend over the past 115 years are inconsistent with explanations in terms of climate or deliberate intervention alone. Previous global initiatives have had minor impacts on malaria transmission, and a historically unprecedented decline has been observed since 2000. However, there has been little change in the high transmission belt that covers large parts of West and Central Africa. Previous efforts to model the changing patterns of P. falciparum transmission intensity in Africa have been limited to the past 15 years or have used maps drawn from historical expert opinions. We provide quantitative data, from 50,424 surveys at 36,966 geocoded locations, that covers 115 years of malaria history in sub-Saharan Africa; inferring from these data to future trends, we would expect continued reductions in malaria transmission, punctuated with resurgences.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Radically truncated MeCP2 rescues Rett syndrome-like neurological defects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24058</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the lysosomal calcium-permeable channel TRPML3</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed of three members: TRPML1–TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3 gives rise to the varitint–waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes, inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel activation, and that it acts as a ‘gating pulley’ for lipid-dependent TRPML gating.

 Mouse embryonic stem cells derived from the epiblast contribute to the somatic lineages and the germline but are excluded from the extra-embryonic tissues that are derived from the trophectoderm and the primitive endoderm upon reintroduction to the blastocyst. Here we report that cultures of expanded potential stem cells can be established from individual eight-cell blastomeres, and by direct conversion of mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Remarkably, a single expanded potential stem cell can contribute both to the embryo proper and to the trophectoderm lineages in a chimaera assay. Bona fide trophoblast stem cell lines and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells can be directly derived from expanded potential stem cells in vitro. Molecular analyses of the epigenome and single-cell transcriptome reveal enrichment for blastomere-specific signature and a dynamic DNA methylome in expanded potential stem cells. The generation of mouse expanded potential stem cells highlights the feasibility of establishing expanded potential stem cells for other mammalian species.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Nucleosome–Chd1 structure and implications for chromatin remodelling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Chromatin-remodelling factors change nucleosome positioning and facilitate DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The conserved remodelling factor chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 1(Chd1) can shift nucleosomes and induce regular nucleosome spacing. Chd1 is required for the passage of RNA polymerase IIthrough nucleosomes and for cellular pluripotency. Chd1 contains the DNA-binding domains SANT and SLIDE, a bilobal motor domain that hydrolyses ATP, and a regulatory double chromodomain. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Chd1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to a nucleosome at a resolution of 4.8 Å. Chd1 detaches two turns of DNA from the histone octamer and binds between the two DNA gyres in a state poised for catalysis. The SANT and SLIDE domains contact detached DNA around superhelical location (SHL) −7 of the first DNA gyre. The ATPase motor binds the second DNA gyre at SHL +2 and is anchored to the N-terminal tail of histone H4, as seen in a recent nucleosome–Snf2 ATPase structure. Comparisons with published results reveal that the double chromodomain swings towards nucleosomal DNA at SHL +1, resulting in ATPase closure. The ATPase can then promote translocation of DNA towards the nucleosome dyad, thereby loosening the first DNA gyre and remodelling the nucleosome. Translocation may involve ratcheting of the two lobes of the ATPase, which is trapped in a pre- or post-translocation state in the absence or presence, respectively, of transition state-mimicking compounds.

 Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in RNA molecules. Although many editing sites have recently been discovered, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the ADAR proteins. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex cis- and trans-regulation of A-to-I editing.

 Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a Ca2+-releasing cation channel that mediates the calcium signalling and homeostasis of lysosomes. Mutations in TRPML1 lead to mucolipidosis type IV, a severe lysosomal storage disorder. Here we report two electron cryo-microscopy structures of full-length human TRPML1: a 3.72-Å apo structure at pH 7.0 in the closed state, and a 3.49-Å agonist-bound structure at pH 6.0 in an open state. Several aromatic and hydrophobic residues in pore helix 1, helices S5 and S6, and helix S6 of a neighbouring subunit, form a hydrophobic cavity to house the agonist, suggesting a distinct agonist-binding site from that found in TRPV1, a TRP channel from a different subfamily. The opening of TRPML1 is associated with distinct dilations of its lower gate together with a slight structural movement of pore helix 1. Our work reveals the regulatory mechanism of TRPML channels, facilitates better understanding of TRP channel activation, and provides insights into the molecular basis of mucolipidosis type IV pathogenesis.

 Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a cation channel located within endosomal and lysosomal membranes. Ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, its loss-of-function mutations are the direct cause of type IV mucolipidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. Here we present the single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of the mouse TRPML1 channel embedded in nanodiscs. Combined with mutagenesis analysis, the TRPML1 structure reveals that phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) binds to the N terminus of the channel—distal from the pore—and the helix–turn–helix extension between segments S2 and S3 probably couples ligand binding to pore opening. The tightly packed selectivity filter contains multiple ion-binding sites, and the conserved acidic residues form the luminal Ca2+-blocking site that confers luminal pH and Ca2+ modulation on channel conductance. A luminal linker domain forms a fenestrated canopy atop the channel, providing several luminal ion passages to the pore and creating a negative electrostatic trap, with a preference for divalent cations, at the luminal entrance. The structure also reveals two equally distributed S4–S5 linker conformations in the closed channel, suggesting an S4–S5 linker-mediated PtdInsP2 gating mechanism among TRPML channels.

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Service Provider Qualification and Monitoring Processes at Science Exchange</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D organizations are rightfully cautious when selecting service providers. So much is at stake — reputation, intellectual property, pipeline decisions, regulatory approval, financial investments, and time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ISO-9001-Logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ISO 9001 Certified QMS Science Exchange&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-1151&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ISO-9001-Logo-300x152.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By partnering with Science Exchange, R&amp;amp;D organizations can finally rest assured that they are accessing a network of service providers that meets their most stringent criteria for quality and integrity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put your reputation into the best hands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Every service provider on the Science Exchange platform is rigorously qualified and operates under pre-established legal agreements that protect intellectual property (IP), define confidentiality obligations, and ensure quality and compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We stand by the unmatched quality of our ISO 9001-certified service provider qualification and monitoring processes. Our process verifies details of service provider &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;compliance, reputation, financial standing, and staff expertise:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: MPFI scientists discover regional differences among chandelier cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=10186</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/mpfi-scientists-discover-regional-differences-among-chandelier-cells/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience show that location matters when it comes to brain cells’ gene expression, connections, and innervation area&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is composed of distinct regions that differ in their functional roles and cellular architecture. For example, the hippocampus is an area well-known for its involvement in memory and its dysfunction in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, while the neocortex is involved in functions such as perception, consciousness, and language. The hippocampus has a single, curved cell layer, while the neocortex has six, stacked layers. At the cellular level, although they share canonical types of inhibitory interneurons (INs) and excitatory principal neurons (PNs), it remains largely unknown to what extent a single type in different brain regions displays similarity in gene expression, axonal shape, connectivity, and developmental origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To approach this problem, researchers in the laboratory of Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), took advantage of a unique class of INs called chandelier cells. As their name suggests, these neurons have a distinctive, chandelier-like shape. Most importantly, when their axonal processes stretch out and connect to neighboring cells, they almost always do so at the same location on that neuron – the axon initial segment – and nowhere else. These powerful inhibitory connections control the output of hundreds of neighboring excitatory PNs. These stereotypical features and the fact that chandelier cells are present in both the hippocampus and the neocortex make them an ideal model to study regional differences in a single canonical neuronal type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize different cell types in the brain, researchers often need genetic access to that cell – the ability to express a gene of interest only in, say, chandelier cells, but not neighboring neurons. Years ago, Taniguchi developed a method for studying chandelier cells in the neocortex, but access to those in the hippocampus has remained elusive. Two postdoctoral researchers in Taniguchi’s lab, Yugo Ishino, Ph.D. and Michael Yetman, Ph.D., followed in his footsteps, painstakingly screening molecules until they found one that was reliably expressed in hippocampal chandelier cells – cadherin 6. Luckily, a mouse model already existed that allowed the team to take advantage of this gene expression and use it to compare the two cell populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the ability to compare these two populations, the team found that chandelier cells in the hippocampus expand twice the size of axonal arbors in the neocortex and made twice as many connections as their counterparts. Additionally, the hippocampal chandelier cells were born several days earlier during embryonic development than the neocortical ones. Lastly, the team identified a gene, calretinin, in the hippocampal cells which was not expressed in the neocortical cells – suggesting the possibility that these cells exhibit different functional properties as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists wondered what factors determined regional differences in these cells’ characteristics. Were the traits predetermined by genes that were set at the start of the cell’s life? Or did the environment in which they ‘grew up’ have a stronger influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question of nature versus nurture, the researchers took cells that would grow to become chandelier cells in the hippocampus and transplanted them into the neocortex, and took cells that would grow to become neocortical chandelier cells and transplanted them to the hippocampus. Each ended up taking on the characteristics of its new neighbors, implying that the environment that they grew up in strongly influenced the fate of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, Taniguchi explained, show that exquisite modifications of canonical neuronal types in different brain regions may contribute to their functional diversification. Future studies should elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which regional environment controls phenotypic variations of neuronal types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the novel genetic access to hippocampal chandelier cells developed in the Taniguchi Lab at MPFI, neuroscientists can begin asking questions about the function of these cells within learning and memory circuits. The ability to manipulate specific genes within these hippocampal chandelier cells may allow for more meticulous studies of several diseases, including epilepsy and schizophrenia, in which these neurons have been implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Can Deadly Zika Virus Cure Brain Cancer?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22930</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/09/can-deadly-zika-virus-be-used-as-an-anti-cancer-tool/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, Zika virus was dominating headlines. A new infection was hardly ever heard about before then, yet is now affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Latin America, causing disfiguration and microcephalia in new-born babies. Microcephalia is caused by severe delayed and abnormal development of the brain, resulting in the range of intellectual disability, dwarfism, poor motor functions and speech. With no cure or even preventive vaccination available, many women in the most affected regions were reportedly considering postponing any planned pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was actually discovered back in 1947 in Zika forest in Uganda (and this is where its name comes from). The pathogen is related to better known viruses causing dengue and yellow fever. The disease is spread predominantly by one type of mosquito and was a rare occurrence until the epidemics of 2015–2016, when in Brazil alone well over 100,000 cases were reported. The disease caused particular concern as it coincided with the run-up to the 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from mosquitoes, the virus can be spread through sexual contact and from mother to child during &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/12/top-pregnancy-and-labor-apps/&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; or at delivery. The latter way of transmission is a particular concern: while adults suffer only very mild symptoms (fever and rush), children infected during pregnancy suffer major &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/&quot;&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that viral infection delays brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research identified a more specific reason: Zika virus specifically targets neural progenitor cells, the cells responsible for production of other neurons. This is what makes the virus very dangerous for the developing fetus. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/&quot;&gt;Neuron progenitor cells&lt;/a&gt; are abundant in the developing fetal brain. However, only a few are left in the brain of adults. In adults with completely formed brain, Zika virus infection causes only mild symptoms, if any (Zika fever). But the specificity with which the virus targets neural progenitor cells gave researchers an idea that might revolutionize the treatment of one of the deadliest types of brain cancer—glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat, with patients rarely surviving even one year after diagnosis. Unfortunately, this is also one of the most common types of brain cancer. Approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with glioblastoma in the US alone. The quick return of the disease even after aggressive surgery is caused by the survival of a few glioblastoma stem cells. Many  types of cancer like glioblastoma grow due to the existence of cancer stem cells that give rise to other tumor cells. The glioblastoma stem cells remain almost unaffected by all radio- and chemotherapy regiments currently used to treat this malignancy, even though these therapeutic approaches do kill other cells in the tumor. They also successfully avoid detection and elimination by the immune system, allowing the regrowth of cancer in a short period of time after surgery, replenishing the cancer cells eliminated by therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that glioblastoma stem cells are, in many ways, very similar to normal neural progenitor cells. Therefore, infecting a person with glioblastoma with Zika virus might help in treating the disease by eliminating the stem cells. This was a core idea that researchers initially tested on cancer cells from tumors obtained from surgeries. It turned out that the virus does indeed kill cancer stem cells, leaving other cancer cells almost unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further make sure that the virus doesn’t affect the normal cells of the brain, scientists have performed experiments on brain tissues from patients with epilepsy. The tests did not detect any damage to these cells due to viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that combining traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/&quot;&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; with treatment with Zika virus may help to eliminate stem and non-stem cancer cells. Such an outcome will most certainly be beneficial for the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the idea further, scientists injected Zika virus directly into the brain of mice with brain tumors. In all animals infected with the disease, tumor growth slowed down significantly and the animals survived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that Zika virus can be injected into the brain of a glioblastoma patient at the time of surgery. The subsequent chemotherapy will remove any remaining cancer cells that survived surgery, and Zika virus will kill the residual glioblastoma stem cells. The published findings also suggest that the virus can be further engineered to be more easily eliminated from normal healthy brain cells using the patient’s immune system. Less harmful strains of the virus have already been developed to this end and have demonstrated some success in animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if a successful therapeutic approach to treat deadly glioblastoma can be developed using Zika virus. The path to future use of Zika-based treatment in hospitals will likely be long. The original results, however, are very encouraging. This new approach is another fascinating example of a growing number of new innovative tools that are currently being developed to treat a variety of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

had made it my goal to walk the attendees through the usual &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; workflow.
So, that's exactly what we did. We started by setting up an empty repository,
then added files to it, learned how to see changes and so on. Then, we moved
on to branching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd explored the advantages of using branches we started working with
remotes. Everyone set up repositories on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. To end with, I
got everyone to fork my repository and submit pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone got the hang of it. There were some good questions, a bit of
discussion too. I do hope it'll get more people to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to
different projects on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Excessive Porn Consumption Can Cause Erectile Dysfunction – Myth or Truth?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22918</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing trend of healthy young men using medications like Viagra and Cialis, drugs intended for older men and those with health-related erectile dysfunction (ED).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these young men (unknowingly?) use these drugs to treat a condition that is psychological rather than physiological: porn-induced &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/07/30/vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-its-neurological-consequences/&quot;&gt;erectile dysfunction &lt;/a&gt;(PEID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online social groups and websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainonporn.com/&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Porn&lt;/a&gt; and Reddit’s “no fap” group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&lt;/a&gt;) were founded to help men with PIED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, studies that checked for a connection between watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;porn&lt;/a&gt; and erectile dysfunction found no evidence associating the two. If that’s the case, what explains the sharp rise in ED cases in young men in recent years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B8-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;Swiss researchers&lt;/a&gt; used the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), finding an ED rate of 30% in a cross-section of Swiss men aged 18 to 24. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B9-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;2013 Italian study&lt;/a&gt; reported that one in four patients who sought help for new-onset ED were younger than 40, with rates of severe ED nearly 10% higher than in men over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Takeesha Roland-Jenkins (MS in psychology and MS in neurology) a professional consultant for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betweenusclinic.com&quot;&gt;Between Us Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, to weigh in. Takeesha is an expert in both psychology and neurology, and she has a unique insight into both the psyche and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your opinion, can excessive porn consumption really cause a man to experience erectile dysfunction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, watching hardcore porn excessively, especially pornography with deviant and violent behavior can cause mental changes that may result in erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in a man’s brain when he is exposed to extreme sexual stimuli (such as hardcore pornography) and how does this relate to ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore pornography is often graphic and generally displays deviant, violent, and abnormally kinky behavior. This is not typical for the average sexual encounter and it can create unrealistic mental perceptions of how a man should engage in sexual activity. Furthermore, a man may initially get a thrill from watching what he believes is an exotic encounter, but over time excessive porn watching desensitizes men to intense sexual stimuli and even sexual violence which sometimes occurs in the porn that is being viewed, thereby lowering the ability to engage in true intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornography, in general, causes intense mental stimulation that changes the way the brain views sexual activity and sexual violence in pornography exaggerates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;alterations in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is similar to becoming more tolerant to a certain drug after prolonged use; meaning you eventually need higher and higher doses to experience the same feelings of euphoria. Repeatedly watching hard-core porn can have a similar effect on sexual performance. In other words, watching excessive porn changes the way the brain processes sexual arousal and activity, often leading to desensitization that lowers libido and causes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betweenusclinic.com/mental-impotence/psychological-impotence-diagnosis-causes-and-treatments/&quot;&gt;psychological erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say that men who watch too much porn can develop performance anxiety. Why does anxiety affect the ability to get and maintain an erection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because a man’s brain has now become accustomed to getting stimulated at the sight of intense pornographic images, an ordinary encounter will cause the man to wonder if he will be able to perform at a similar level (e.g., for extended periods) as what has been observed in a pornographic video. Therefore, the performance anxiety is still related to the changes that occur in the brain and wondering if he can satisfy his partner in the manner that the brain has become used to. In other words, the anxiety is a direct result of worrying about being able to re-enact the sexual scenes in porn; this unrealistic goal can lead to performance anxiety. Subsequently, a man may get an erection, but after beginning to worry about whether he can perform like the actors in porn, the erection may soften or stop altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, other than performance anxiety, is there another reason why porn could cause men to experience ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes that occur in the brain’s ability to lead to an erection contributes more to PIED than performance anxiety. Over time the brain needs increasing levels of stimulation from the pornography in order to initiate an erection. Performance anxiety can unfortunately worsen erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does porn-induced erectile dysfunction cure itself if the man stops watching porn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discontinuing pornographic viewing does not automatically cure PIED. Furthermore, drugs such as Viagra or Cialis target the physical aspect of erectile dysfunction, not the psychological aspect. This means that a man will become completely dependent upon such drugs until the brain restores its ability to initiate an erection under ordinary sexual circumstances. A healthy relationship (e.g., marriage) with a patient partner can help a man overcome PIED over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What form of treatment would you recommend a man who suffers from PIED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneficial treatment would be in the form of individualized therapy, which may vary in time (e.g., weeks, months) depending on the individual and the degree of PIED. As PIED is often the result of an addiction to pornography, this form of treatment should be viewed as the first step to addiction recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of therapy is to begin to desensitize the brain to the pornographic images and to address some of the reasons that the addiction to porn more than likely started. Men are also encouraged to reconnect intimately with their partners in order to help the brain restore its ability to initiate sexual arousal during ordinary sexual encounters. Overall, a man must be willing to give himself time to gradually overcome PIED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/snow-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-9423&quot; height=&quot;1944&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2592&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an Adjunct lecturer at Edith Cowan University, Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquatic microbial ecology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the small invisible things that are all around us and particular their presence and role in nutrient cycling in extreme aquatic environments such as glacial melt pools and microbially dominated lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went on my first trip to the Arctic doing research in Svalbard, the beauty and sterile environment of the Arctic fascinated me. I kept this fascination of extreme environments, and continued and did my Ph.D. in the Antarctic where I got to experience the low light environment in the winter months. After my time in the Antarctic, I spent a few more years in the sub-arctic of Sweden, where again I experienced the beautiful low light environment that is associated with the polar winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo was taken on the sea ice in Prydz Bay in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. I took it with my old Nikon camera, a pretty standard camera and the photo was taken from the seat of my quad motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part of my Ph.D. in the Antarctic and was there for just over a year; when this particular photo was taken in June I was heading back to the Davis research station from one of the huts called bandits hut after a “jolly trip” (i.e. weekend break away from the station) with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the winter months in the Antarctic and the Arctic, you get these fantastic pink skies as the sun never really rises above the horizon; in this photo I was lucky to get the moon in the perfect position between the two icebergs on the sea ice. I still remember the moment as we were riding our bikes on the sea ice in this eerie pink light and seeing the moon perfectly positioned between the towering ice bergs, just one of them moments that will be with me forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eerie, but also soft, light of the pink Antarctic winter skies and the perfect symmetry of the moon right in between the icebergs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain situations where it’s advantageous for an introvert to take charge. For instance, perhaps they are better qualified than their extroverted peers. The trouble is, most introverts tend to shy away from seizing informal leadership opportunities when they arise (psychologists call this “emergent leadership” – when someone takes charge in a team without a formal hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917305767#bb0125&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; suggests this might be because introverts expect to find group tasks and situations unpleasant, which inhibits them from displaying the kind of behaviours required to take charge of their group. By helping introverts to realise they may enjoy leadership more than they expect, Andrew Spark and his colleagues at Queensland University of Technology say it may be possible to encourage more introverts to step up to the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31060&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a study of nearly 200 undergrad business students who completed personality tests prior to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Survival_Lesson.html&quot;&gt;group task&lt;/a&gt; devised by NASA which involves making decisions together about survival priorities on the moon. Before they started the group task, the students rated how much they thought they would find it fun and exciting or scary and stressful. Afterwards they rated each other for signs of emergent leadership during the task, such as “he/she influenced group decisions” or “he/she led the group conversation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, introverts showed less emergent leadership than extraverts. What’s more, compared with extraverts, they also expected to experience much more negative emotion and feelings during the group task. These two factors seemed to be related: when fully accounting for any differences in participants’ negative expectations, introversion was no longer associated with less emergent leadership. The researchers’ methodology can’t prove that negative expectations cause introverts to refrain from showing leadership, but their findings are consistent with that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23586413&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that suggests introverts find acting extraverted more enjoyable than they think they will, Spark and his team suggest that perhaps introverts will also enjoy leadership-related behaviours more than they anticipate. “If introverts can develop strategies to more accurately forecast their enjoyment of behavior more conducive to emergent leadership,” the researchers said, “then it is possible that such individuals will be on a level playing field with extraverts in relevant social situations”. However, the researchers added “these possibilities are somewhat speculative at this point”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do their homework or reach over there for the iPad and dive into a world of games? It’s the ever-present dilemma facing young children today. Here’s a simple technique that could tip the balance a little in favour of the homework. Psychologists have &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12695/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that when four- to six-year-olds pretended to be Batman while they were doing a boring but important task, it helped them to resist distraction and stay more focused. The challenge now is to nail down exactly why the technique works, and to see if over time it could improve children’s self-regulation skills without them needing to go through the ritual of pretending to be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30939&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel White and her colleagues, including Angela Duckworth famous for her work on “grit”, recruited 180 kids aged 4 to 6 years and had them take some basic psych tests assessing their mental control, memory and empathy. Next the researchers asked them to complete a boring, slow but supposedly important ten-minute computer task that involved pressing the space bar whenever they saw a picture of cheese or not pressing anything when the screen showed a cat. The children were encouraged to stay on task, but they were told they could take a break whenever they wanted and go play a game on a nearby iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the children were assigned to a “self-immersed condition”, akin to a control group, and before and during the task were told to reflect on how they were doing, asking themselves “Am I working hard?”. Other children were asked to reflect from a third-person perspective, asking themselves “Is James [insert child’s actual name] working hard?” Finally, the rest of the kids were in the Batman condition, in which they were asked to imagine they were either Batman, Bob The Builder, Rapunzel or Dora the Explorer and to ask themselves “Is Batman [or whichever character they were] working hard?”. Children in this last condition were given a relevant prop to help, such as Batman’s cape. Once every minute through the task, a recorded voice asked the question appropriate for the condition each child was in [Are you working hard? or Is James working hard? or Is Batman working hard?].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-year-olds spent more time on task than the four-year-olds (half the time versus about a quarter of the time). No surprise there. But across age groups, and apparently unrelated to their personal scores on mental control, memory, or empathy, those in the Batman condition spent the most time on task (about 55 per cent for the six-year-olds; about 32 per cent for the four-year-olds). The children in the self-immersed condition spent the least time on task (about 35 per cent of the time for the six-year-olds; just over 20 per cent for the four-year-olds) and those in the third-person condition performed in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that pretending to be a popular fictional character helps young children to resist distraction, at least compared to the other conditions used in this experiment. White and her team think this is probably at least partly because it helps create a feeling of self-distance from the task, which is known to help people resist immediate distractions and prioritise longer-term goals. The trouble is, there are so many other aspects to the Batman condition that could have led to its apparent benefits, such as perhaps it simply made the boring task more fun, or maybe the children identified with their fictional character and assumed some of his or her qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of the origins of the benefits [of the Batman condition] seen here, it is important to note that pretending to be another character had large effects on children’s perseverance,” the researchers said. They note that the great American psychologist William James observed how “voluntarily bringing back the wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character and will” but that he also lamented how difficult it is to teach this life skill. “The current research,” the researchers concluded, “suggests that perseverance can be taught through role play, a skill that is accessible to even very young children.” Adults too may be wondering if this is something they could try – at the very least it could provide an excuse for wearing a Batman cape to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This installment of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;New on Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; features spectrometry experts at CMP Scientific, Protypia, CovalX, Nightingale Health, and The Scripps Center for Metabolomics. Ready.. set … analyze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Emass-II-Ion-Source-CMP-Scientific.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Emass-II Ion Source CMP Scientific&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-1148&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Emass-II-Ion-Source-CMP-Scientific-300x251.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;CMP Scientific&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Capillary electrophoresis – mass spectrometry (CE-MS) experts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Analytical researchers frustrated by the long separation times, high sample requirements, or low throughput of LC-MS have long been attracted to the advantages of CE-MS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2015, the CE-MS technique was revolutionized — in that year, Brooklyn, New York-based &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CMP Scientific&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; pioneered the EMASS-II CE-MS ion source, a novel interface between the capillary and the mass spectrometer’s electrospray emitter that conferred nanoflow sensitivity and high electrospray efficiency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since then, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/cmp-scientific-corp/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;CMP Scientific &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has gained a proven track record for helping drug discovery and development companies develop CE-MS methods for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical analysis. Will your research program be the next to benefit from CE-MS technology? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What are the biological effects of the exposome — i.e., the sum of all environmental toxicants, food contaminants and supplements, drugs, and antibiotics your body is exposed to daily? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thanks to XCMS/METLIN, a software combined with a cloud-based database founded by the researchers at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/scripps-center-for-metabolomics&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, investigations into the elusive exposome are now possible. On September 25, the lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945073&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;published the results of their initial study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; — and we were very excited to have such a groundbreaking team join the Science Exchange network!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Easing the Bioinformatics Bottleneck: OnRamp Bioinformatics</title>

	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/10/easing-the-bioinformatics-bottleneck-onramp-bioinformatics/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Natalie Foote, Director of Service Provider Operations, Science Exchange | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OnRamp Bio Logo&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1143&quot; height=&quot;134&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo-1024x229.png&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to Tim Wesselman, CEO of today’s featured provider OnRamp Bioinformatics, there are only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onramp.bio/blog/data-management-storage-partnership-announcement&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;15,000 bioinformaticians worldwide today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to support more than 2 million biologists and other researchers. As a result, analysis has become the rate-limiting step in next-generation sequencing studies, and very large datasets may go un-analyzed to the point of obsoletion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To ease this bottleneck, OnRamp Bio offers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;services that empower researchers with insights that they can understand and put into action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Software as a service: accessible bioinformatics for non-experts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OnRamp Bio has made significant progress in making bioinformatics accessible to larger numbers of researchers. Earlier this year, OnRamp Bio launched a new software-as-a-service for RNA-Seq analysis, to meet the needs of researchers needing assistance in making decisions based on the large data sets yielded by RNA-Seq experiments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Genomics big data and complex software analyses have historically required highly trained PhDs in Bioinformatics using complicated command-line tools. OnRamp Bio’s intuitive user interface, automated analyses and robust data management make it faster and easier for scientists, biologists, clinicians and other medical professionals to obtain interpretations of genomic data without the complexity of traditional deployments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“IT complexity has stood in the way of progress for far too long. We’ve combined our deep knowledge of IT and biology to provide intuitive, integrated systems and services that accelerate mainstream adoption of NGS analyses within biotech and pharma,” said Tim Wesselman, CEO of OnRamp Bio. “For institutions focused on drug discovery, cancer research, diagnostic, or therapeutic development, OnRamp Bio can help show how to implement next generation sequencing to securely build into future research, while getting immediate answers more cost-efficiently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In addition to offering end-to-end genomic analysis services, OnRamp Bio recently made the news when it launched Rosalind™, the first-ever software platform specifically designed to simplify genomic analysis (named for one of the researchers who discovered the double helix structure of DNA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Faces of OnRamp Bioinformatics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: In and Out of the Abyss: Depression After Brain Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22942</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/04/in-and-out-of-the-abyss-depression-after-brain-surgery/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Once again I was on the phone to my friend, sobbing. She’d put up with my tears every day since I left the hospital. Two or three daily meltdowns were the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my tears were over things that would have merely irritated me before: misplaced scissors, dirty socks in the middle of the living room, a brief computer glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have cavernous angiomas, tangles of malformed blood vessels, scattered throughout my brain. Two of them—one larger than a golf ball in my right parietal lobe, and the other, smaller, in my brain stem—had bled, and I underwent &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/07/29/heading-into-brain-injury-should-we-be-concerned/&quot;&gt;brain surgeries&lt;/a&gt; to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bleeds and surgeries led to side effects including loss of balance, vertigo, nystagmus, trouble with sensory overload, and a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/&quot;&gt;cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt;. My emotions also seemed volatile. I expected that my emotions would settle down as my brain healed. They didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting up with about a month’s worth of meltdowns, my friend spoke up. “I think you need meds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. The possibility of psychiatric medication had not occurred to me. The people I knew who needed it had major issues: a cousin whose mother had died when she was ten years old, a friend who had been suicidal, a student with bipolar disorder. I wasn’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/&quot;&gt;depressed&lt;/a&gt;. I just got really upset too easily. I was just fragile, and, given what I’d been through, that was understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t in denial over my emotional state. Aware of my extreme vulnerability, I’d been proactive: I’d started seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/15/psychotherapy-and-clinical-boundaries/&quot;&gt;psychotherapist&lt;/a&gt; regularly within days of my return home from the hospital. I had things under control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that brain injury can cause chemical imbalances, which can lead to clinical depression. In one account I read, a patient lamented not having gone on antidepressants sooner. Feeling fortunate that I wasn’t in that bad of shape, I sympathized with those who were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; didn’t need meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, as the tears flowed more often and more freely, my friend grew more insistent. I continued to resist, explaining away my vulnerabilities. It was normal to grieve over losses. I blamed really bad days on my menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the severity and frequency of my meltdowns increased, I had more trouble rationalizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spiraled into the abyss and finally reached the bottom. I felt desolate. I knew I was a burden on everyone around me and that my life wasn’t much of a life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/&quot;&gt;Suicide&lt;/a&gt; seemed logical, perhaps the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept my suicidal thoughts secret—I didn’t want my friend or my therapist to try to talk me out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
Weeks later, when I began to emerge from the abyss, I kept my silence because I felt ashamed, and later still, I added guilt to the shame—I had betrayed the trust of both my friend and my therapist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to rationalize my lie-by-omission: I told myself that I could never really take my life, that I didn’t have it in me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in some corner of my mind there must have been doubt mixed with the rationalization because a few days later I decided to discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; with my therapist. She agreed with my friend: it was time to consider meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the brain bleeds, I was averse to pill popping. I took painkillers for my migraines and antibiotics for bacterial infections—no other medications. After the bleeds, I started taking blood-pressure meds (Verapamil) to cut back on the chances of another bleed and anti-seizure meds (Lamictal). I was concerned about messing with my body chemistry, and worried about drug interactions—I wanted to avoid medications that listed seizures as a possible side effect. Given my concerns, my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who specialized in psychopharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure whether there was a viable solution within my comfort zone, but the answer turned out to be straightforward: the psychiatrist suggested simply increasing my daily dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/08/03/anti-epileptic-drugs-and-the-risk-of-suicide/&quot;&gt;Lamictal&lt;/a&gt;. Anti-seizure meds not only prevent seizures; they also act as mood stabilizers and are often used to combat depression and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist conferred with my neurologist, who, concerned about adverse reactions to the Lamictal, was firm about capping my daily dose at 600 milligrams. My psychiatrist, determining that my depression was severe, decided to increase the dose directly from the 400 milligrams I was on to 600 milligrams, instead of ramping up in increments, which is the standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded well to the increase. Feeling like myself once again, I realized just how badly off I’d been. Like my cousin, my student, and my friend, I too had major issues. Except that I really &lt;i&gt;wasn’t&lt;/i&gt; like them—&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; issues were temporary. Once my brain healed, my depression would be over, and I’d be able to get off the meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a good four years and a couple of trial runs with lowered dosages before I managed to fully shrug off that piece of denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade later, I’m still on antidepressants, for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depression isn’t “situational.” Good friends and therapy help me survive, but they aren’t enough. The bleeds and surgeries changed my neurochemistry. These changes are real, and they’re here to stay. The meds are here to stay, too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A social psychologist has retracted a second paper that contains “fabricated or manipulated data.” The first retraction for William Hart at the University of Alabama — also due to data manipulation — appeared earlier this year. The notice raised some questions over authorship: Hart was the sole author, but he blamed the retraction on a […]&lt;/p&gt;
