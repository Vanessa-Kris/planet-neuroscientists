	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Open access (OA) has seen extensive growth in Australia since the first open access repository was launched in 2001[1]. There are Open Access policies at the two major research funders: The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC) . Around half of Australian Universities have an OA policy or statement; most policies are for Green (repository based) OA and OA  has become a fundamental part of the scholarly publishing and research landscape in Australia. The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group (AOASG), the Council of Australia University Librarians (CAUL), and the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) are advocates for Open Access and related issues in Australia....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abstract The current state of antibiotic discovery, research and development is insufficient to respond to the need for new treatments for drug-resistant bacterial infections. The process has changed over the last decade, with most new agents that are in Phases 1–3, or recently approved, having been discovered in small- and medium-sized enterprises or academia. These agents have then been licensed or sold to large companies for further development with the goal of taking them to market. However, early drug discovery and development, including the possibility of developing previously discontinued agents, would benefit from a database of antibacterial compounds for scrutiny by the developers. This article describes the first free, open-access searchable database of antibacterial compounds, including discontinued agents, drugs under pre-clinical development and those in clinical trials: AntibioticDB (AntibioticDB.com). Data were obtained from publicly available sources. This article summarizes the compounds and drugs in AntibioticDB, including their drug class, mode of action, development status and propensity to select drug-resistant bacteria. AntibioticDB includes compounds currently in pre-clinical development and 834 that have been discontinued and that reached varying stages of development. These may serve as starting points for future research and development.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Monitoring sector progress towards compliance with funder open access policies – Andrea Chiarelli</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 2017, we worked with the former HEFCE, RCUK, Jisc and Wellcome to develop an open access assessment template in the form of an online survey. Our survey has now been used to produce a study, released by the recently-formed UKRI. Please find the Executive Summary of our report “Monitoring sector progress towards compliance with funder open access policies” below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was jointly commissioned by HEFCE, RCUK, Jisc, and Wellcome to develop an open access assessment template for the UK higher education sector. The final template, in the form of an online survey, is due to be circulated to all UK higher education institutions (HEIs) later in 2017. It will be used to enhance understanding of how the sector is meeting funders’ open access policies and to inform future policy implementation, benchmarking and systems developments. This report summarises the work done by Research Consulting to develop and pilot a draft assessment template between May and July 2017. It also provides insights into 18 institutions’ progress towards the delivery of OA, gathered via qualitative interviews conducted as part of the pilot process....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Open Access Projects in Digital Humanities Win Prestigious Prizes, Tackle Social Problems and Spark Intellectual Debates | Open Science</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given that digital humanities, as a minor but growing academic domain, promote scholar collaboration, cross disciplinary boundaries and demonstrate public-mindedness, the celebration of its achievements, such as in research, underlines the centrality of Open Access to its public relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While digital humanities can be tentatively defined as an interdisciplinary field that explores the intersections between digital tools and media, on the one hand, and humanities-related subject matter, on the other hand, Open Access is a broad characterization of the projects accomplished in this field, which can comprise online archives, freely accessible digital resources and online initiatives, such as in education and data sharing. No less importantly, digital humanities output can also include academic articles, topical issues of scholarly journals and monograph-scale investigations, for instance in Open Access, as studies recently published by De Gruyter demonstrate. Though digital humanities is a nascent field of scholarly inquiry, it already has a significant presence at academic conferences, such as at the annual get-together of the Modern Language Association. Given their basis in technological tools and interfaces, digital humanities projects may, however, struggle to be funded, especially at smaller scale educational or research institutions, such as community colleges. Yet this does not impede the harnessing of digital humanities for educational, research or archival purposes in the framework of topical projects that leverage disparate institutional resources, e.g., the United States’ Library of Congress’ strategic plans to promote specialized information availability for the general public and scholars around the world, in which Open Access de facto plays a significant role....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Open-source model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://listproductinfo.blogspot.com/2018/06/open-source-model.html</guid>
	<link>http://listproductinfo.blogspot.com/2018/06/open-source-model.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;The open-source model is a decentralized software-development model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open-source appropriate technology, and open-source drug discovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. Before the phrase open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. Open source gained hold with the rise of the Internet. The open-source software movement arose to clarify copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you ever spent hours sifting through journal papers? Ever got frustrated at your inability to find relevant research? Ever wished that there was an easier way to filter the seemingly endless stream of information on the web? The team at Iris.ai certainly did, which is why they have created an AI-powered science assistant to help anyone that wants to find related papers for an original research question. The software – Iris.ai – can be used to build a precise reading list of research documents, and the company claims that it can solve your research problems 78% faster (without compromising quality) than if you were carrying out the tasks manually. The concept for Iris.ai was first established three years ago at NASA Ames Research Centre. The team was taking part in a summer programme run by Singularity University (SU) when they were set the task of creating a concept that would positively affect the lives of a billion people. This exercise got the team thinking about the current state of scientific research, and more specifically about the restrictions created by paywalls, and the inability of human intelligence alone to process the three thousand or so research papers that are published around the world every single day....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: The Impact of Big Deals on the Research Ecosystem – IO: In The Open</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://intheopen.net/2018/06/the-impact-of-big-deals-on-the-research-ecosystem/</guid>
	<link>http://intheopen.net/2018/06/the-impact-of-big-deals-on-the-research-ecosystem/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Earlier this month I read this article by Kenneth Frazier from D-Lib Magazine which argues that academic libraries should reconsider the value of so-called “big deals” from publishers. The core of the argument is that the downsides of these journal packages outweigh the benefits of convenience and an arguably lower cost per title. I say “arguably” about cost per title because, if one excludes the titles in a bundle that are rarely or never used when calculating per title cost, the value proposition is significantly different. The simple fact is that publisher bundling “deals” are larded with what, from the point of view of usage, is simply junk – obscure titles of little value that can only be sold by tying them to more desirable resources. If I want “Cell Biology” for my researchers, I also must buy “Dancing Times,” even if no one on my campus uses the latter.* At my institution, to give just one example, over 30% of the titles in our journal package from Wiley are “zero-use,” but it is still less expensive to buy the package than to subscribe, at list price, only to the titles that would get substantial use.  This tying of titles, and enforcing the bulk purchase by charging grossly-inflated “list prices” for title-by-title purchases, is highly coercive, as Frazier points out, but it also creates some perverse incentives for the publishers themselves, which led me to think about the potential consequences of big deals for things like peer review....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A traditional Amazonian psychedelic brew is an effective and rapid-acting antidepressant, according to a paper just published. But the new study revives some long-standing questions.



Ayahuasca is a mixture of herbs, traditionally used for spiritual and therapeutic purposes. The main active ingredients are N,N-DMT, a potent psychedelic, and several molecules that inhibit the enzyme MAO. The MAO inhibitors serve to prevent the N,N-DMT from being broken down by the digestive system, allowing</description>

They used a bifactor model to account for the general factor as well as specific, orthogonal factors (seven in this case). The differing measures above are often used interchangeably and called “risk”, but the general factor &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; only...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;...explained substantial variance across propensity measures and frequency measures of risky activities but did not generalize to behavioral measures. Moreover, there was only one specific factor that captured common variance across behavioral measures, specifically, choices among different types of risky lotteries (F7). Beyond the variance accounted for by R, the remaining six factors captured specific variance associated with health risk taking (F1), financial risk taking (F2), recreational risk taking (F3), impulsivity (F4), traffic risk taking (F5), and risk taking at work (F6). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the behavioral tasks didn't explain &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; at all, and most of them didn't even explain common variance across the tasks themselves (F7 below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NvHZJti7iq4/WyYe2ow-O9I/AAAAAAAAMjY/ANaZhvIbsZosPib1TjcnMTG39_zAaOaTQCLcBGAs/s1600/Bifactor%2Bmodel%2Bwith%2Ball%2Brisk-taking%2Bfactors.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;558&quot; data-original-width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NvHZJti7iq4/WyYe2ow-O9I/AAAAAAAAMjY/ANaZhvIbsZosPib1TjcnMTG39_zAaOaTQCLcBGAs/s400/Bifactor%2Bmodel%2Bwith%2Ball%2Brisk-taking%2Bfactors.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/10/e1701381.full&quot;&gt;Frey et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; Bifactor model with all risk-taking measures, grouped by measurement tradition. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;BART is outlined in red&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's where we come to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26164-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Sour Promotes Risk-Taking: An Investigation into the Effect of Taste on Risk-Taking Behaviour in Humans&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; on “risk” and taste.

The number of clicks (pumps) indicates risk-taking behavior. Overall, the Vietnamese students (all recruited from the School of Biotechnology and Food Technology at Hanoi University) appeared to be riskier than the UK students (but I don't know if this was tested directly). The main finding was that both groups clicked more after drinking citric acid than the other solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h3NSxvowELA/WyYwfajUsPI/AAAAAAAAMjo/NKMwiaEliIQn8-6ZiC7qQCkk-0Kfr6B3ACLcBGAs/s1600/UK%2Bparticipants.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;338&quot; data-original-width=&quot;471&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h3NSxvowELA/WyYwfajUsPI/AAAAAAAAMjo/NKMwiaEliIQn8-6ZiC7qQCkk-0Kfr6B3ACLcBGAs/s400/UK%2Bparticipants.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HHMqBb3kop8/WyYwfbyVuVI/AAAAAAAAMjk/GGLi-6lrhlYLpMWqCzGAEkVZDlWErYVHgCLcBGAs/s1600/Vietnamese%2BParticipants.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;366&quot; data-original-width=&quot;482&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HHMqBb3kop8/WyYwfbyVuVI/AAAAAAAAMjk/GGLi-6lrhlYLpMWqCzGAEkVZDlWErYVHgCLcBGAs/s400/Vietnamese%2BParticipants.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would this this balloon pumping be more vigorous after tasting a sour solution? We could also ask, why were the Vietnamese subjects more risk-averse after drinking salt water, and riskier (relative to UK subjects) after drinking sugar water?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We simply don't know the answer to any of these questions, but the authors weren't shy about extrapolating to clinical populations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For example, people who are risk-averse (e.g., people with anxiety disorders or depression) may benefit from a sour additive in their diet. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelling lemon oil is relaxing, but tasting citric acid promotes risk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prior work has, for instance, shown that in cases of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorders the use of lemon oils proved efficient and was further demonstrated to reduce stress. While lemon and sour are not the same, they share common properties that can be further investigated with respect to risk-taking.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're really not sure how any of this works. The authors offered many more analyses in the Supplementary Materials, but they didn't help explain the results. Although the sour finding was interesting and observed cross culturally, would it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sxbegle/status/1005073824981794817&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replicate&lt;/a&gt; using groups larger than n=14?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; From &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/10/e1701381.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frey et al.

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: University of Washington: Open Access Policy, Class B Legislation, Faculty Code and Governance | May 17, 2018</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.washington.edu/faculty/files/2014/05/188-Final.pdf</guid>
	<link>https://www.washington.edu/faculty/files/2014/05/188-Final.pdf</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;General Legislative Action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its meeting on May 17, 2018, the Faculty Senate approved Class B legislation to create Chapter 54 in Faculty Code and Governance. President Ana Mari Cauce has also approved the proposed legislation, subject to identification of appropriate funding. The faculty is now being given the opportunity to submit written objections to its substantive nature, under the Faculty Code, Chapter 22, Section 22-74 Senate Procedure: Class B Actions. A copy of the proposed changes are included with this notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class B Legislation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty Code and Governance Chapter 54 Open Access Policy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 54-31 Purpose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a public university, the University of Washington is dedicated to making its research and scholarship freely and widely available to the people of Washington and the broader research community. In addition to the public benefit, the following policy is intended to serve faculty interests by: promoting the visibility and accessibility of their work, resulting in greater impact and recognition; helping them retain distribution rights; and aiding preservation of the scholarly record....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Charli Colegate, Portfolio Developer in the Humanities &amp;amp; Social Science research funding department at Wellcome talks about how Wellcome Open Research can help researchers overcome some of the issues associated with publishing social science and humanities research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant challenges with publishing health-related humanities and social science research: Long publication lead-times can be vexing, particularly for those who work in fast moving fields, e.g, those working in areas related to health emergencies Narrow scopes of journals are a concern for those whose work is interdisciplinary. A significant proportion of the projects we fund involves work that reaches across disciplinary boundaries. We understand that finding the right ‘home’ for research of this kind can often be a struggle. Reaching diverse audiences can also be tricky. Your work may well have relevance to not only your discipline, but to researchers outside of your own field and even those working within health in a non-research capacity. It can be very difficult to reach the public health practitioner if you’re publishing in a journal whose main remit is the history of conceptual feminist theory. Wellcome Open Research provides a solution that might contribute to overcoming these challenges....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Monitoring sector progress towards compliance with funder open access policies | Research England</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://re.ukri.org/documents/2018/research-england-open-access-report-pdf/</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During August 2017, the former HEFCE, RCUK, Jisc and Wellcome surveyed Higher Education Institutions about their compliance with, and experience of funder open access policies. The aim of the work was to investigate progress towards our shared goal of increasing the extent to which the outputs of publicly-funded research are freely and openly available. This report details the findings from the survey responses, and represents a snap- shot of the progress towards open access. The report should be read in the context of other work that examines the extent to which scholarly content is openly available in the UK and beyond, especially the report commissioned by the Universities UK Open Access Co- ordination Group.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of this report coincides with the open access reviews of major UK funding bodies. Both Wellcome and the newly-established UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) are conducting an internal review of their open access policies. The evidence put forward in this report will be considered as part of both reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey and its findings focus on policy and implementation issues...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The current academic publishing norms impose many constraints on how and what we publish without fully embracing the new web-enabled dynamics. The emergence of the internet as the de facto publication medium, and the availability of open source technologies for handling the hosting and peer review process, have made it possible for organizations such as OHBM to experiment with innovative publishing platforms and to host high-quality research objects while promoting reproducible and open science. With Aperture, OHBM plans to open up to a more diverse approach in communicating academic research, bringing transparency and interactivity to the publishing process. While initially our focus will be on reviews, tutorials and educational materials, we foresee using this format to incorporate computational notebooks, interactive plots, software, data, and post-publication peer-review to create living, reusable and reproducible research objects. We hope to have a beta version of Aperture in time for the Rome meeting in 2019....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Encouraging scholars to ‘speak truth to power:’ Political Communication Chief Editor Piers Robinson on open access and democratizing academia – Science &amp; research news | Frontiers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.frontiersin.org/2018/06/15/piers-robinson-political-communication-section/</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;“Fake news.” The phrase, subject to mockery in 2016, has crept its way into common usage on social media, news articles — and is even now uttered from the mouths of reporters. Did we merely accept the phrase, or did its reinforced use challenge us to confront the issue of deception in news media? Furthermore, are we — or should we be — surprised that we debate and discuss key political changes in 280 characters, punctuated with the authority of a trending hashtag, #TrumpKimSummit #cambridgeanalytica #Brexit to name but a few? Understanding the way we communicate about politics in the 21st century is integral to exploring our relationship with our changing world. To facilitate new research in this key field, Frontiers in Communication welcomes Professor Piers Robinson from the University of Sheffield, UK, as Chief Editor for its new Political Communication specialty section. “For me, studying political communication ultimately is about making society better through enabling democracy and helping to empower people, through knowledge, so that they themselves can actively engage in the political process,” says Prof. Robinson. A leader in the field of political communication, propaganda and deception in contemporary liberal democracies, Prof. Robinson adds that techniques designed to manipulate beliefs and behaviors are growing ever more sophisticated, especially with the internet and rise of ‘digital propaganda’. The discipline, he advises, needs to address these issues in a way that really does ‘speak truth to power,’ and holds those in power to account. “There is a saying that the role of a journalist is to ‘comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable;’ I think that this is a mantra academics should also live by.” Prof. Robinson has brought together an exceptional board of Associate Editors, with the aim of jointly developing a forum for innovative scholarship and enabling critical and progressive research. All articles published within Political Communication will be open-access, free to read for people across the world. “I strongly believe that people possess the intelligence and skills to read, understand and contribute to academic debate,” he says. “We, as academics, should not be shy about taking our material out in to the public realm. Open access helps us to do that. It helps to democratize academia and empowers citizens through knowledge.”&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: REFlecting on progress towards open access - Research England</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/reflecting-on-progress-towards-open-access/</guid>
	<link>https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/reflecting-on-progress-towards-open-access/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In March 2014, the four UK funding bodies announced an open access policy for the next Research Excellence Framework (REF 2021). The policy states that publically funded research should be discoverable and free to read and download from 1 April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REF2021 OA policy is working&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward four years and the REF 2021 OA policy has established itself as one of the driving forces behind outputs from the UK’s academic community being freely available to read and download. A report published today shows that the UK is making huge strides towards open access. Over eighty percent of outputs that are within scope of the REF OA policy are meeting the policy requirements, or an exception is known to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is a snapshot of all outputs in scope of the REF open access policy, monitoring the first year of policy implementation from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. It shows that sixty one percent of outputs are compliant with the policy, with a further twenty percent reporting a known exception. Significantly, a high proportion of outputs where an exception to the policy is known to apply are freely available through the ‘gold’ open access route. ‘Gold’ open access refers to publishing in a way that allows immediate access to everyone electronically and free of charge. These outputs are fulfilling the policy intent....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Auburn University releases findings of a report on universities’ open access, open data policies and practices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ocm.auburn.edu/newsroom/news_articles/2018/06/auburn-university-releases-findings-of-a-report-on-universities-open-access,-open-data-policies-and-practices.htm</guid>
	<link>http://ocm.auburn.edu/newsroom/news_articles/2018/06/auburn-university-releases-findings-of-a-report-on-universities-open-access,-open-data-policies-and-practices.htm</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Auburn University, the founding institution for Presidents United to Solve Hunger, or PUSH, has partnered with the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition, or GODAN, initiative to investigate the progress of 99 universities in the PUSH consortium on the development, promotion and use of open access and open data. Open access refers to the free online availability of research findings and open data allows for the sharing, analyzing and re-use of that data by other researchers. In the words of André Laperrière, executive director of GODAN, and Catherine Woteki, former USDA Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, “The research that universities perform is essential for solving some of the world’s most urgent concerns. Unfortunately, a significant part of this data is lost, misplaced or locked in closed repositories kept within the walls of universities.” Anne Adrian, project manager for the Hunger Solutions Institute at Auburn, led the exploratory study and found that only 15 of the 99 PUSH universities surveyed had open access policies posted on their websites, and none had specific open data policies. This absence is despite the fact that many federal agencies and private funders, such as the Gates Foundation, are often requiring research data to be publicly accessible. To examine the challenges, benefits and recommendations for promoting open access and open data, Adrian and her team conducted in-depth interviews with personnel from nine PUSH universities who had advanced knowledge about their institution’s open access and open data policies. Challenges cited from the interviews included privacy issues, misuse of data, ambiguity about data ownership, insufficient resources and lack of alignment regarding expectations and capabilities between funders and universities. Many, however, did acknowledge that public institutions have a responsibility to work toward the greater good, and acceleration of innovation and research through open access and open data is a way to achieve that goal. More tangible benefits identified were increased research collaboration, greater data transparency, increased number of author citations and wider recognition for faculty and their respective universities. Because university open data policies and practices are not well defined, the study offers several recommendations for moving toward a culture of openness. Among them are implementation of an effective communication plan; development of advanced data management standards and protocols; compliance training for faculty and graduate students; adequate funding for personnel and infrastructures and alignment of funders’ expectations with the capabilities of universities. In line with the recommendations of this study, as well as those recently put forth in a joint report by the American Association of Universities and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities calling for greater access to research findings and other data to accelerate scientific advancements, PUSH presidents are starting to acknowledge the urgency of open data and are taking action to move forward. “Auburn University is becoming increasingly cognizant of the role that public access and the use of open data play in accelerating innovation and research, ultimately leading to solutions for pressing global challenges,” said Auburn President Steven Leath. “We are forming a working group that will begin outlining detailed standards, protocols and platforms needed to implement open data management plans, not only related to agriculture and nutrition as called for by GODAN, but across all disciplines.” Likewise, Mississippi State University President Mark Keenum, who also serves as chairman of both the PUSH Steering Committee and the Board for International Food and Agriculture Development, added, “As we face the daunting challenge of feeding nearly 10 billion people by 2050, universities are being called upon to develop best practices and infrastructure to promote the sharing and use of open data to advance agriculture and nutrition research. At Mississippi State, we are working diligently to leverage the power of open access and data sharing to meet this challenge, and I encourage my fellow presidents and chancellors to join us.” The full report, “Open Access &amp;amp; Open Data at PUSH Universities,” is available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Simplifying OA Policy Compliance for Authors Through a Publisher- Repository Partnership. ELPUB 2018, Jun 2018, Toronto</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01816819/document</guid>
	<link>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01816819/document</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 The Canadian Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications (Government of Canada, 2015) in effect May 2015 presented federal grant recipients with a challenge of incorporating open access compliance into their research workflows. The policy requires that peer-reviewed articles arising from CIHR, SSHRC, or NSERC funding be made publicly available within 12 months of publication. Researchers have an option to comply by publishing in an open access or a hybrid journal or by depositing a copy of an article in an open access institutional or subject repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Despite increased outreach efforts and assistance provided by many Canadian academic libraries as well as Canadian not-for-profit publishers such as Canadian Science Publishing, compliance to the policy remains a challenge for researchers who are either unaware of the policy or unsure how to comply. Additional challenges for researchers stem from the fact that while the cost of open access publishing is an eligible grant expense, many grantees do not receive enough funding to cover author processing charges, particularly where multiple publications are produced in the course of a research project. The “green” repository route is usually free, but relies on understanding of publishers’ self-archiving policies that often require the deposit of an accepted manuscript of a paper, a version that authors don’t tend to keep. With the onus of compliance placed on grant recipients, and with no centralized infrastructure in place to facilitate the process, it is not surprising that researchers often feel trapped between a rock and a hard place, and compliance levels remain low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To streamline compliance for their authors, Canadian Science Publishing, an independent, not-for-profit publisher of over 20 science journals approached the University of Toronto Libraries with an idea of automated transfer and deposit of author manuscripts into the U of T’s research repository, TSpace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4 This free service is available to authors publishing their papers in 21 CSP’s NRC Research Press journals2 and only takes authors one click to opt into. The partnership was launched in April 2015 and makes over 1,200 manuscripts openly available annually....&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: Building Open Knowledge – Micah Vandegrift – Medium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a sense of a thing that is building. It has a pillar in the OpenCon community, a foundation in the digital humanities, a keystone in higher education policy, and a truss in librarianship. In the various roles I’ve played between all those worlds, I’ve tried to name some essential characteristics that provide a foothold for my work, interests, and future-orientation. How should we define digital scholarship? In what ways is any of this different than the work we’ve always done in the academy, save for the ease and efficacy of doing more with technology? Thankfully, I’m a puzzler so I puzzle over these kinds of things, hoping to make sense of the state of things, and what is important about it. Joining the library at NCSU recently, I have a lot to be excited about. Too much to list. But there is one thing I feel particularly responsible to deliver on; the job title of Open Knowledge Librarian feels like a mandate and a mantle. I know titles are a dime a dozen, but I do take seriously the opportunity to use this elbow room to advance a broad idea of what we mean when we say “open knowledge.” I believe that we are at or reaching a saturation point where the open agenda encompasses more than it doesn’t, and there are many folks working in the aforementioned areas that will be the vanguard of redefining that agenda, and producing some influence and impact that the world will notice....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals for the development and deployment of automated tools to assign Confidence Scores (CSs) to different kinds of Social and Behavioral Science (SBS) research results and claims. CSs are quantitative measures that should enable someone to understand the degree to which a particular claim or result is likely to be reproducible and/or replicable. These tools will assign explainable CSs with a reliability that is equal to, or better than, the best current human expert methods, and will enable a consumer of SBS research to quickly calibrate the level of confidence in the Reproducibility and Replicability (R&amp;amp;R) of a given SBS result or claim. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;Open data, public data sets opened in Italy grow to 55%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic dataset basket update: jump forward of the indicator from 45.68% in 2016 to 55.15% in 2017. In the same period the EU countries get 72% in terms of open data availability. Until June 18, open data questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until June 18, open data questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update of the &quot;Dynamic dataset basket&quot; is online in Italy for 2017. According to the data.gov.it platform, the update gives us an overall result that can be considered positive, with an increase in the indicator from the 45 , 68% in 2016 to 55.15% in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Italy, of course, is to maintain a similar trend in the coming years, also taking into account that, according to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, the target value of the indicator for 2023 is 90% for each category of regions, in consideration of the continuous diffusion of a topic considered particularly important for the modernization of the Public Administration as a whole, in support of the demand....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: MPFI Scientist Secures a $2.4 Million Grant to Investigate Inhibitory Circuits in the Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=10887</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/mpfi-scientist-secures-a-2-4-million-grant-to-investigate-inhibitory-circuits-in-the-cerebral-cortex/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;The project will focus on applying advanced imaging technologies paired with precise genetic techniques to disentangle how inhibitory circuits in the cortex are constructed.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has been awarded a $2.4 million five-year grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Over the life of the grant the Taniguchi Lab will take a closer look at a class of brain cells known as inhibitory interneurons, studying how members of this diverse cell type assemble into specific circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is arguably the brain’s most complex structure, endowing us with extraordinary abilities such as sensory perception, language, and cognition. Underlying these capabilities are the intricate connections made by the neurons that reside within, enabling complex encoding and processing of information. Interneurons in the cortex normally act to balance, refine and shape information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in a wide array of brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their critical importance, comprehensive wiring diagrams of interneuron circuits and the exact principles that guide their assembly have remained rather elusive. One challenging aspect hindering the design of a concrete cortical blueprint, is the sheer diversity of interneurons and principle neurons they form connections with. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make specific connections depending on a principle neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Until very recently, neuroscientists lacked readily available tools sensitive enough to study these connections at a cell-type specific resolution. Overcoming this obstacle, the Taniguchi lab has designed novel genetic tools and incorporated them into the established technique of retrograde monosynaptic labeling, producing unprecedented results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their powerful technique now allows for the precise tracing of connections from individual types of interneurons. MPFI scientists will be able to determine how inhibitory connections form during development and elucidate the organization of specific inhibitory inputs on varying types of principle neurons. Uncovering these principles will dramatically improve our understanding of cortical circuits as well as pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of prominent brain disorders.&lt;br /&gt;
“Cortical interneurons are a unique cell class with rich diversity, containing numerous types with distinctive features and functional properties.” Notes Dr. Taniguchi, “This crucial funding will allow us to probe individual types of interneurons, better establishing the principles behind their wiring. Addressing this critical topic will lead to a better understanding of inhibitory circuit design and the future development of novel therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant described in this release is supported by the National Institutes of Health, Award Number R01MH11591701. The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/15/bmc-ecology-image-competition-announcement-2018/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-1_Overall-winner_Podocnemis-expansa_Ana-Carolina-Lima​-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that the 6th annual &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; image competition launches today! We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/aug/18/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2017-in-pictures&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/awardwinning-photos-taken-during-actual-scientific-research-this-year/&quot;&gt;IFL&lt;/a&gt; Science, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/&quot;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151&quot;&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging the competition will be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; Section Editors&lt;/a&gt;, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10250&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-10250&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/2016-winner-sunset-1024x614.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;2016’s overall winner by Davide Gaglio, the striking landscape of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park during sunrise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Davide Gaglio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is affiliated with a research institution can enter. All entrants should agree to release the images under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons license&lt;/a&gt; , which states that the images can be freely shared, reused and modified as long as they are properly attributed to the photographer. BMC does not retain the rights to the images. And each entrant can submit five images at most to this competition. We ask that entries be submitted to one of the five categories listed below and that they depict a specific ecological interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behavioral and physiological ecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservation ecology and biodiversity research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community, population, and macroecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Landscape ecology and ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theoretical ecology and models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will consider all images from photos to data visualizations, or a mixture of both – as long as they are &lt;strong&gt;striking&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;meaningful&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;creative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1360</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/06/science-exchange-appoints-two-new-executives-to-accelerate-growth/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Veteran marketing and business development executives join Science Exchange to help lead the company through its next phase of growth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PALO ALTO CA, June 14, 2018 –&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BUSINESS WIRE&lt;/a&gt;)–Science Exchange, the&lt;i&gt; leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;amp;D&lt;img alt=&quot;™&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, has appointed senior team members Rob Mihalko as Vice President of Marketing and Alex Slater as Vice President of Business Development and General Manager Europe. Both executives, reporting to Science Exchange CEO Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., will add to an already talented management team that is driving industry-leading solutions to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Mihalko is a leading expert in business commerce and procurement and has extensive experience in successfully implementing go-to-market strategies for business-to-business marketplaces on a global scale. As VP of Marketing, Mihalko will be responsible for Science Exchange’s worldwide marketing activities. He will lead the way in aligning Science Exchange’s brand and product positioning with global marketing programs to boost awareness, sales and adoption of the company’s industry-leading R&amp;amp;D marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining Science Exchange, Mihalko was Global Vice President of Solution &amp;amp; Customer Marketing for SAP Ariba, where he led marketing and product initiatives that transformed SAP Ariba into the world’s leading procurement and business commerce company. He also has held several senior marketing, product and finance roles with leading technology companies, including Microsoft, and was a management consultant with A.T. Kearney, advising senior executives on strategy, sourcing and supply chain transformation initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m delighted to have joined such a passionate and mission-driven team at Science Exchange,” said Mihalko. “I’m looking forward to helping the company build on its leadership position in the outsourced research market and support its growth in new verticals and geographies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a VP of Business Development and General Manager Europe, Alex Slater will be spearheading Science Exchange’s continued expansion into the European market. Slater brings 23 years of business development experience within contract research organizations to Science Exchange, spanning the entirety of drug discovery, from basic research to clinical development. He has also led business development teams in Europe and Asia for Covance and, most recently, was the VP Global Business Development at Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Slater will provide key leadership and support of Science Exchange’s business development and expansion efforts in Europe. He will work with the global business development team to stimulate provider and researcher recruitment and expand the European support team that will give researchers the personalized scientific support they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From my initial interactions with Elizabeth Iorns and the team at Science Exchange, I was impressed by their passion and commitment to simplifying researchers’ access to the services they need,” said Slater. “I look forward to working with such a driven team and helping expand the company’s European presence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We work in a rapidly changing environment, and so it’s critical for us to hire people that share our ambitious vision and have the expertise to help us execute it successfully,” said Elizabeth Iorns, CEO of Science Exchange. “I’m thrilled to be welcoming our two new team members, who each bring vast experience to Science Exchange, and I look forward to working closely with them in our mission to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ labels keep the fruit and veggies away</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/14/3-5-day-labels-keep-fruit-veggies-away/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoothies-2253430_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we make sure that nutrition labels making the 5-a-day claim aren’t being used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on processing and fiber breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable and it should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are government schemes in place in various countries, manufacturers will sometimes make their own claims on food packaging, which are not covered by government regulations. Provided that manufacturers are following the best practice guidelines for the industry, this should mean that the product contains 80g (or more) of fruit or vegetables in one serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts of healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a study, recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labelled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two FV product labels were used. Each product label stated the product as a ‘smoothie’, included the smoothie flavor, and stated either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’, using the recognized national UK logo for the 5-a-day FV message. All participants were asked to look at their smoothie before consumption and were required to consume their smoothie in full, although neither the label nor the message were mentioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent FV consumption was assessed using 24-h recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect viewed was largely driven by changes in consumption in usual high FV consumers, in females, and in vegetable as opposed to fruit consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Greater regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

We were satisfied that, after some historical issues, improvements had been made to their peer review process working with the OASPA membership team … Eight months on from our acquisition, Dove are performing well in all areas, we remain confident that we got value for money, and are delighted that they are part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Group.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are one or two places in the Q&amp;amp;A where readers may feel there is a little repetition. If so, this is because the interview was done by email in a staged way. I have, however, not edited the text as I am keen to publish Kahn’s answers exactly as she emailed them to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I am wondering why Taylor &amp;amp; Francis (T&amp;amp;F) decided to buy Dove Medical Press? I have seen the short &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.taylorandfrancisgroup.com/dove-medical-press-joins-taylor-francis-group/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; published at the time, which talks of Dove journals having Impact Factors (and of T&amp;amp;F wanting to expand in OA and medical journals) but I am also aware that the perception in the market is that (as this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/U80xCjRvnlfnGj58ot4-9e3?domain=statnews.com&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;), titles from Dove “tend to rank poorly on impact factor”. Can you say more about why T&amp;amp;F chose to buy Dove? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Open Access and Medical publishing are both strategically important areas of investment and growth for Taylor &amp;amp; Francis. So we were delighted when we were able to enter into discussions with Dove Medical Press, as they fit so well with our plans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove Medical Press is a small and entrepreneurial company, with staff based in Auckland and Macclesfield, all of whom are committed to excellent service to authors, and high-quality peer review. They publish around 100 journals, of which 12 have impact factors ranging from 1.7 to 7 –  almost all of them placed within the top two quartiles of the Journal Citation Report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two more titles are set to receive Impact Factors in the next release of the JCR. The vast majority of the rest of the journals are indexed in the DOAJ, PubMed and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mjl.clarivate.com/cgi-bin/jrnlst/jlresults.cgi?PC=EX&quot;&gt;ESCI&lt;/a&gt;). All of these indexes perform in-depth checks on the quality and integrity of the contents of journals before accepting them for indexing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We chose to buy Dove because we were impressed by the quality of their content, the quality of their peer review, their focus on author experience, and their loyal author following, with a high percentage of repeat authors. We rated it a very good business in its own right and knew that we would learn from them as we continued to develop our own open access offerings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How much did T&amp;amp;F pay for Dove?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; This wasn’t disclosed at the time of acquisition. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://informa.com/media/press-releases-news/latest-news/informa-extends-open-access-position-and-capability-with-addition-of-dove-medical-press/&quot;&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt; released by Informa, our parent company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Yes, I saw that, but I was hoping you could tell me anyway? Frankly, I don’t understand why this information needs to be secret, although I suppose it fits with the secrecy that has always surrounded Dove. When I interviewed Dove’s Tim Hill in 2008 he refused to tell me who the owners of Dove were and denied that (despite what some believed) there was any connection between Libertas Academica (LA) and Dove, or with him (aside from the fact that the owner of LA was his son). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, when in 2010 I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-i-wont-be-doing-that-video.html&quot;&gt;emailed him&lt;/a&gt; to point out that New Zealand Companies House records that he had one time been the sole director and shareholder of LA, and had in fact  been a director of LA when he told me in 2008 that there was no connection, he responded, “Henceforth I will not be providing you with any comment or information on any subject.” In 2016, I tried to make contact with Dove directors Graeme Peterson and Kevin Toale, neither of whom responded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can you tell me why there has always been this kind of secrecy surrounding Dove? OA advocates argue that scholarly publishing is primarily funded by the taxpayer and so should be transparent both in process and financing. There is now also a widespread belief that there should be even greater transparency with regard to medical research, and those who publish it, not least because it is felt that pay-to-publish OA has made it easier for pharmaceutical and medical device companies to use scholarly papers as marketing tools. Do you agree that there are dangers here and that greater transparency is essential? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I do believe that there should be transparency in all scholarly publishing, both in traditional subscription and open access publishing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/&quot;&gt;OASPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wame.org/&quot;&gt;WAME&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;DOAJ&lt;/a&gt; have collaborated to identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing&quot;&gt;Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, and these principles form part of the criteria on which membership applications to those organizations are evaluated. All Dove journals are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2JeQrsr&quot;&gt;included in the DOAJ&lt;/a&gt; and have “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/faq#thetick&quot;&gt;the tick&lt;/a&gt;”, which means they have met the high level of compliance to these criteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All Dove journals are also members of COPE and have met their membership criteria also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t think that there has been secrecy around Dove Medical Press. Information about the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04967656&quot;&gt;has been available from Companies House&lt;/a&gt; since they came into existence in 2003. Nothing in our due diligence suggested anything to the contrary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim Hill (from Dove) is Tom Hill’s father, and he may have helped his son establish Libertas Academica in the first instance. However, Tim Hill was not involved in the direction or any of the operations of Libertas Academica. No current Dove staff have ever worked with or as part of Libertas Academica, nor do the two companies share any operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Dove is registered in the UK but, as I understand it, the company actually operates out of New Zealand. Did that present any particular issues during the negotiation process? Does it present any difficulties today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dove has offices in both Macclesfield and Auckland with 1/3 of the staff in the UK and 2/3 in New Zealand. These two locations are actually a real advantage, as it means we can offer global coverage and 24-hour customer service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from a few late night and early morning meetings for people in both locations, there are few disadvantages, and as a bonus I have been very much enjoying getting to know Auckland, and reacquainting myself with Macclesfield which is close to where I grew up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Founders and directors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Dove had quite a number of directors. Who did T&amp;amp;F deal with when negotiating the purchase? Was Dove’s MD involved in the negotiations? Apart from the company’s directors (who I believe have all left), have most Dove staff remained with the company? Has the Dove Press Publisher remained?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dove had three founders all of whom were involved in the negotiations. They have left the business, but almost all of the staff have remained. Dove has a very loyal staff, and it seems has much lower staff turnover than other publishing companies I have worked in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Unfortunately, you didn’t answer my question about the Dove Press Publisher Tim Hill. Is he still with the company? You also did not say whether the Dove MD Graeme Peterson was involved in the negotiations. I would be grateful if you could address these questions? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The founders of the company were Philip Smith, Kevin Toale and Tim Hill, all of whom have left the company, and with whom we negotiated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Smith was Managing Director of Dove. Graeme Peterson has never been the Managing Director of Dove. When he became a Director of Dove, he was (and still is) Managing Director of Prime Global (previously Prime Medica). The Companies House listing clearly shows that he was Company Secretary and Director of Dove from 2004 to 2017. His listing shows his occupation as Managing Director, but this was of Prime Global not of Dove.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You talk of three founders of Dove. When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2008/11/open-access-interviews-dove-medical.html&quot;&gt;spoke to&lt;/a&gt; Tim Hill in 2008, he told me the company was founded by “a group of former publishing executives, mostly from ADIS International” and that it was owned by “six private individuals”. Companies House records show there were four directors of the company – Graeme Peterson, Philip Smith, Kevin Toale and John Stolz. The shareholders included Peterson, Smith, Toale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-dolben-96b526/&quot;&gt;William Dolben&lt;/a&gt; (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contentednet.com/corporate/content/solutions&quot;&gt;ContentEd&lt;/a&gt;, which offers “a complete publishing service for the pharmaceutical industry”), a company called JSI Communications (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsi.co.uk/&quot;&gt;medical communications company&lt;/a&gt; owned by John Stolz, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.sys.mac.misc/2005-09/msg00037.html&quot;&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; also to have also acted as a Dove commissioning editor) and the T&amp;amp;A Hill Family Trust (which I assume is connected with Tim Hill). Who were the three founders you talked to?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I said above, the company was founded by Kevin Toale, Philip Smith and Tim Hill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;RP: Was T&amp;amp;F aware at the time it made a bid for Dove how controversial the company was? For instance, Dove was one of the first OA publishers to attract criticism for spamming authors (and was &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/-89XCkRwomfOXnW92SxTN6x?domain=gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.co.uk&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; a “black sheep” by Gunther Eysenbach); it has featured on Retraction Watch fairly regularly; it was at one time on Jeffrey Beall’s list of “Potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers”; it was caught in the &lt;/i&gt;Science&lt;i&gt; open access &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/6eXJCmZ2EotjP5JzyFPaUzP?domain=science.sciencemag.org&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (for which it had its &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/RZdxCn5Yzpc73GOv9C5KQYw?domain=oaspa.org&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;membership of OASPA terminated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;); it got mixed up in the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/qRp7Co2vOqfrPXqE2t8TftA?domain=poynder.blogspot.co.uk&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dr Amy Bishop incident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;; and one of its peer reviewers &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/bz-FCpYRz0unOzMm4tEpNuO?domain=retractionwatch.com&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;roundly condemned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; its publishing platform, saying that it did not even allow reviewers to reject papers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did any of this concern T&amp;amp;F during the negotiation process? If so, why did it go ahead with the purchase? What exactly does T&amp;amp;F do in terms of due diligence before it acquires another company? Did it go through this process in the case of Dove?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; We went through very detailed due diligence, carrying out an extremely thorough process, when we acquired Dove Medical Press. We were satisfied that, after some historical issues, improvements had been made to their peer review process working with the OASPA membership team. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/dove-medical-press-reinstated-as-oaspa-members/&quot;&gt;led to their OASPA membership being reinstated&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in an extremely robust peer review process described in detail in their peer review schematic on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3526&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, some of the additional checks they have added since that schematic was published go way beyond what most publishers do in their peer review process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are in addition to the usual ethical checks which quality medical journals perform, and include: checking the affiliations of all authors and checking retractionwatch.com to identify whether any of the authors have been involved in unethical practices; manuscripts being checked for duplicate submission or publication and run through the SciDetect software; and IP address checks to make sure that there is no COI between author, reviewer and Editor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Due diligence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Publishing a schematic is surely a good idea. What is key, of course, is routinely following that process. But you didn’t answer my question: what exactly does T&amp;amp;F do in the way of due diligence before it acquires another company?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; All papers submitted to Dove go through the same rigorous process which, as I said, is more rigorous than that on the schematic and than many I have seen in other publishers. Any implication that this is not routinely followed is unfounded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As far as due diligence is concerned, as part of Informa, all acquisitions by Taylor &amp;amp; Francis go through a very detailed and thorough due diligence. Cross-functional teams of experts from Finance, Legal, Tax, Treasury and Communications meet weekly with the business leads to analyse and assess the risks and considerations concerning any acquisition and follow a detailed process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No acquisition is complete until all questions are answered in detail, and there has been a thorough review by Informa’s senior management. This process was followed with this acquisition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: On Dove’s membership of OASPA: I think it would be fair to say that this has been more of an on-off affair than the above might imply. The timeline is this: Dove joined OASPA in late 2009; Dove withdrew from OASPA on 7th April 2010; Dove applied to join again in May 2012; Dove was re-accepted on 12th July 2012; Dove’s membership was terminated by OASPA on 5th November 2013. Dove reapplied in June 2015 and was accepted on 23rd September 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is not clear is why Dove withdrew from OASPA in 2010. What we do know is that it occurred in the wake of the Amy Bishop affair, in which publicity was given to a controversial paper authored by her and published by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-general-medicine-journal&quot;&gt;Dove’s International Journal of General Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Controversially, Bishop added the names of her minor children as co-authors of the paper. At the time (February 2010) I &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2010/02/open-access-linked-to-alabama-shooting.html&quot;&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about the incident in which I raised the issue of ownership and transparency, and quoted Peter Suber saying, “I am deeply suspicious of publishers who are unwilling to disclose their owners. We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership. I asked them if they could give me a reason but they gave none.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here it is worth noting that co-founder of OASPA Gunther Eysenbach &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/response-to-the-recent-article-in-science/#comment-5201&quot;&gt;has repeatedly alleged&lt;/a&gt; that Dove engages in “questionable publishing practices”. And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”. (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-on-motor-neuron-sur-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been reposted later, again with no indication of its disappearance and reappearance). This will all be part and parcel of what you call Dove’s “historical issues”, but did none of this really give T&amp;amp;F any pause for thought? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I have already discussed the very detailed due diligence we went through which satisfied us that there are no issues that should concern us with their operations. And in working closely with Dove in the eight months since the acquisition, I have been impressed by their high standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is absolutely no evidence of any misconduct on Dove’s part, and despite persistent attempts to find some over the years, it doesn’t seem that you have evidence of any wrongdoing either. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is clear that in the two cases you mention, Bishop and Bohannon, authors who set out to deceive the system managed to do so. This showed up some inadequacies in the peer review processes of those journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of the Bohannon sting in 2013 and their OASPA membership being terminated, Dove worked closely with OASPA to improve their editorial processes and the OASPA Membership Committee were satisfied with those improvements. As I mentioned earlier, Dove also continue to enhance those processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: While we are on the historical issues, in 2011 I was contacted by a US-based publisher who said that Dove had on two occasions launched a journal “identical or nearly identical” to this publisher’s own journals. The publisher added that only after a great deal of pressure from them did Dove change the titles of the two copycat journals. The publisher also pointed out that nine of Dove’s journals had the same EiC, many of which journals were unrelated to that EiC’s specialism. I do not know if this is still the case, but can you confirm that Taylor &amp;amp; Francis would not sanction such things? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; None of the current Dove senior management know anything about this allegation. Dove do have Editors-in-Chief who edit more than one journal, but only in their own specialist area and never more than two or three. Taylor &amp;amp; Francis also have some Editors-in-Chief editing multiple journals, but again only in their specific subject field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;New controversy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As you note, many of these things may be historical issues. However, it seems that the controversy over Dove continues after the acquisition. Seven months after T&amp;amp;F purchased Dove, for instance, its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/W64GCqxV2vt8kO0ZYSw9okT?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;International Journal of Women's Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/I1I7CrkEYwi8nAVEQSwP-n3?domain=dovepress.com&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; that has attracted some worrying criticism – as reported recently by STAT. The paper in question compared patient satisfaction with two competing devices for endometrial ablation, and concluded that the product developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/yfJsCv2YjAf7LWNxwCNJUzh?domain=minervasurgical.com&quot;&gt;Minerva Surgical&lt;/a&gt; was inferior to the competing product developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/RbqrCwpEkBHGVL8Klin2NQY?domain=hologic.com&quot;&gt;Hologic&lt;/a&gt; (which funded the study). On April 26th Minerva published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/weEmCxkVlDi1RJMkEU6eZLm?domain=prnewswire.com&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the Dove article makes “material misleading statements” about the nature of the study and that this is “a clear violation of the COPE guidelines”. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in STAT, Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky say, “We can’t judge the essence of Minerva’s claims, although some — particularly that paid personnel for a device maker biased the selection process for patients in the trial — are quite troubling and would constitute grounds for retraction.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I raised this on Twitter, T&amp;amp;F &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/D8IeCyP6mEtr2NXZOtmXtBv?domain=twitter.com&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that it was “currently working with the editor-in-chief to look into the concerns surrounding this paper”. But in light of Dove’s history does it not cause you some concern that this has occurred not long after the acquisition?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; It is an unfortunate fact of life that all publishers are having to field more and more disputes between academics and researchers. It is keeping COPE very busy, and there are few journals or publishers who have avoided being featured on Retraction Watch’s pages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of the &lt;i&gt;International Journal of Women’s Health&lt;/i&gt; paper our investigations show that the peer review was carried out to high standards and that the journal behaved well, and the authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; responses have satisfied us that the complaints are unfounded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per ethical guidelines, we have offered the complainant the chance to write a Letter to the Editor with his concerns, which we would publish along with a response from the authors. However, he has not chosen to do so as yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can I just check what you are saying: you see nothing untoward or unusual in a publisher appearing fairly frequently on Retraction Watch? And are you implying that the cases COPE deals with are generally the result of disputes between academics and researchers, not of misconduct, faulty peer review or conflicts of interest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Actually, I don’t. The fact that publishers are amending the scholarly record when they find that there are errors in the literature is a healthy thing. I would be worried if a publisher never retracted anything. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/why-high-profile-journals-have-more-retractions-1.15951&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in Nature shows that journals with higher impact factors have higher levels of retractions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/why-high-profile-journals-have-more-retractions-1.15951&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; suggests that higher levels of retractions may in fact be a good thing. In fact, this second paper finds that the rising number of retractions is most likely to be caused by a growing propensity to retract flawed and fraudulent papers, and there is little evidence of an increase in the prevalence of misconduct. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And no, you are misinterpreting my previous comment. The cases COPE see fall into nine areas, as outlined in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/core-practices&quot;&gt;core practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: On the issue of COIs: My understanding is that the MD of Dove was also the MD of a Medical Education and Communication Companies (MECC), and so presumably was engaged in publication planning. As I noted above, two of the other shareholders appear to have been running MECCs and/or providing publication services for pharmaceutical companies. Do you think that being a shareholder and/or MD of a medical publisher while also being the shareholder and MD or owner of a MECC might raise conflict of interest issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; This is a misunderstanding on your part. The MD of Dove was Philip Smith who did not run any other company. As for the shareholders, shareholders in any organization will have a number of interests. None of the shareholders you refer to played an active role in the organization or its operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;COIs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In March 2017 Dove &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prweb.com/releases/dove-press/nanomedicine-academy/prweb14143325.htm&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was sponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northeastern.edu/nanomedicineacademy/&quot;&gt;The Nanomedicine Academy of Minority Serving Institutions at Northeastern University&lt;/a&gt;. The Director and co-founder of this Academy is listed as being on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-nanomedicine-journal&quot;&gt;The International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, which is a Dove journal and has an impact factor of 4.300. Its website also says that it is indexed in PubMed and Medline. As such, it would seem to be one of the journals that attracted T&amp;amp;F to Dove (In fact, it was singled out for mention in the Informa &lt;a href=&quot;https://informa.com/media/press-releases-news/latest-news/informa-extends-open-access-position-and-capability-with-addition-of-dove-medical-press/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; you cited earlier). The EiC of the journal is the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.che.neu.edu/news/faculty/368?page=8&quot;&gt;co-founder&lt;/a&gt; of the Nanomedicine Academy, and appears to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/search_results.php?search_word=%22thomas+j+webster%22&quot;&gt;published over 100 papers&lt;/a&gt; with Dove, almost exclusively (if not exclusively) in his own journal (two of the papers seem to have been co-authored with the Director of The Academy). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must assume that T&amp;amp;F would have established this during the due diligence process it undertook, and so is comfortable with the arrangement. But I cannot help but think that some would feel it raises conflict of interest issues. What would you say to those who might be concerned about it? Or am I simply misunderstanding the situation and how these things work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journals and Publishers often sponsor conferences and educational courses of various types. I think that if you look at the Academy, you will see that it is an academic partnership dedicated to providing education in nanomedicine to minority populations. This sounds like a great educational initiative, and I cannot see any COI from a Publisher donating to an initiative of this kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As far as the Editor publishing in his own journal is concerned, COPE guidelines do not preclude editors submitting to their own journals. They do expect journals to “have a procedure for handling submissions from editors or members of the editorial board that will ensure that the peer review is handled independently of the author/editor”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3523&quot;&gt;clear guidance&lt;/a&gt; on Editors publishing in their own journals whereby &lt;i&gt;“Editors-in-Chief must declare any financial and/or personal conflict of interest for each submitted manuscript, and decisions on manuscripts in which they have a conflict of interest will be made by another editor”. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No Dove Editor is involved in the peer review of a paper that they are author on, and this is the case with the papers published by this editor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: After SAGE bought Dove’s sister company Libertas Academica it had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ImX0CzpBnGHMwRg6WCLIc6L?domain=plus.google.com&quot;&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; that following “detailed review” it was unlikely that many of LA’s journals would be successful over the long-term. As a result, it shuttered over ¼ of those it had acquired. I wonder if Dove might have to do the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Twitter T&amp;amp;F &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/D8IeCyP6mEtr2NXZOtmXtBv?domain=twitter.com&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “When any list joins T&amp;amp;F we go through an integration phase where we check on all processes and standards and integrate / amalgamate the best of what both orgs do. This is a process that has happened with Dove and is on-going.” Do you anticipate having to close many Dove journals? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; As I said earlier, Libertas Academica had no connection with Dove and was not a sister company so there is no comparison between the two companies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is good publishing practice to regularly review the journals portfolio, and make changes accordingly. Dove had done this review prior to become part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis and had decided to cease the publication of some journals which were not receiving enough quality submissions to sustain them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We reviewed this list together and agreed with their plans. Some of these journals were closed prior to the acquisition but not all had gone through the process by that point, so some are currently being closed. At the end of this process 92 journals will remain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Journal closures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: We may disagree over the definition of a sister company, but as noted earlier, the former MD of Libertas Academica is the son of Tim Hill. And according to New Zealand Companies House it was Tim Hill who registered LA, and he was listed as a shareholder until at least 2009. Does that not suggest to you that the companies were connected?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Please see my previous response on this. No Dove staff, now and previously, have ever been involved in the direction or operations of Libertas Academica.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: On the issue of journal closures, Wikipedia reports that in 2013 Dove published 131 journals. Unless I am miscounting, the Dove website currently lists 136 journals. This would seem to suggest that 44 (32%) of them are due to be closed – which is a higher percentage than were closed at LA. Is it normal for such a high percentage of journals to be closed after an acquisition? Is T&amp;amp;F still confident that it got value for money in buying Dove?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;DK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dove Press has launched 136 journals in the last 14 years. Some of these were not successful and were closed. It is not uncommon for this to be the case, and for publishers to close journals which are not thriving. When we acquired Dove they were publishing 109 journals, and we were aware of and agreed with their plans to close 17 of them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eight months on from our acquisition, Dove are performing well in all areas, we remain confident that we got value for money, and are delighted that they are part of Taylor &amp;amp; Francis Group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you for answering my questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Unhealthy sleep patterns and risk of metabolic syndrome</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/06/13/unhealthy-sleep-patterns-risk-metabolic-syndrome/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/sleep-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like good diet and exercise, sleep is a critical component to overall health. Current sleep guidelines recommend that adults between the ages of 26 and 64 sleep 7-8 hours per night and practice healthy sleep hygiene which includes limiting daytime naps to 30 minutes, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and energy drinks before bedtime and avoiding heavy or rich foods before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that insufficient as well as excessive sleep are associated with health-related conditions such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular events or mortality and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome, which is highly prevalent in Korea, is defined as a metabolic disorder consisting of at least three of the following: elevated waist circumference, high triglyceride levels, low high-density ‘good’ cholesterol levels (HDL-C), hypertension and high fasting glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Seoul National University College of Medicine have carried out the largest study examining a dose-response relationship between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome and its components in 133,608 Korean men and women aged 40-69 years. To do this, they used data from the HEXA study, a large-scale community-based study conducted in Korea during the years 2004-2013, which included information on socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, medication use, family history, lifestyle factors, diet, physical activity, and reproductive factors for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep duration was assessed by asking the question: “In the past year, on average, how many hours/minutes of sleep (including daytime naps) did you take per day?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-10227 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/slimming-2728331_640-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The study, published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, finds that compared to individuals who sleep six to seven hours per day, men who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have metabolic syndrome and higher waist circumference. Women who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have higher waist circumference. Furthermore, sleeping more than ten hours per day was associated with metabolic syndrome and increased levels of triglycerides in men, and with metabolic syndrome, higher waist circumference, higher levels of triglycerides and blood sugar, as well as low HDL-C in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact mechanisms for the gender differences observed are unclear but a possible explanation is that women experiencing menopausal transition face erratic fluctuations and eventual decline in estrogens as well as ovarian estradiol which may lead to frequent sleep disruptions, a common characteristic of long sleep duration. Another theory is that women may have shorter circadian periods which contributes to higher insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10228 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/macaron-2462247_640-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The biological mechanisms that underlie the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome are also unclear but potential factors include levels of hormones which increase appetite and caloric intake or reduce energy expenditure in people who sleep less than seven hours per day, which may lead to increased waist circumference and development of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the cross-sectional, observational nature of this study does not allow for conclusions about cause and effect. Estimates of sleep duration were based on self-report data rather than objective measures and may reflect ‘time in bed’, actual time spent asleep or time people believed they slept. Also, as the study did not distinguish between daytime naps and nighttime sleep, their impact on health could not be assessed separately.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Yourbrainhealth: Pink or blue brains in the womb?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5544</guid>
	<link>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/pink-or-blue-brains-in-the-womb/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5545 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pregnant-2763931_1920.jpg&quot; width=&quot;986&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excerpt from the Introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness&lt;/a&gt;. Also published in the UK and Ireland as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409173199&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Demystifying the Female Brain. A neuroscientist explores health, hormones and happiness.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Nature is selfish. Her one and only goal is for us to have sex to make babies. To ensure dating and mating occurs, the parts of our brain that control reproduction, in particular, the hypothalamus, become ‘masculinised’ or ‘feminised’ to match our male or female gonads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex hormones organise the prenatal brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones influence how these reproductive brain circuits grow and respond. Prenatal life is the first of two life phases when the brain is super sensitive to sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this early period of hormone exposure the &lt;em&gt;organisational&lt;/em&gt; period, as it organises or programs the brain to respond to hormones in adulthood. Many sex differences that do exist are developmentally organised and then &lt;em&gt;activated,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;revealed&lt;/em&gt;, by the action of hormones at puberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the female brain the ‘default’ option?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the prenatal period, the dominating influence is that of testosterone produced by foetal testes. Testosterone helps to ensure that the reproductive regions of the brain in males becomes masculinised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, and in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal !msorm;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of testosterone, brain regions involved in reproductive behaviours in females become feminised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, in the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of a Y chromosome, the default developmental option is for the foetus to become a female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Default’ is a term some people find a little dismissive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help unravel the complexities of male versus female prenatal brain development, I called Margaret McCarthy, a professor of neuroscience who studies the effects of hormones on brain development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. McCarthy is one of the pioneers in the field and conducted some of the first studies on how sex hormones organise the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Default does not mean passive!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy said to me in a tone of voice that had me quickly convinced she’s made that statement more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Try using ‘The developing mammalian brain is &lt;em&gt;destined &lt;/em&gt;for a female phenotype’, instead!” she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of a Y chromosome, all embryos are &lt;em&gt;destined&lt;/em&gt; to become female.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the role of oestrogen in female brain development?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, if testosterone ‘masculinises’ the unborn baby boy, what role does oestrogen from foetal ovaries play in ‘feminising’ the unborn baby girl?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, foetal oestrogen plays no role at all. Female embryos do not require ovarian hormones to become feminised (remember, they’re &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal !msorm;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;destined &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;to become female). Oestrogen’s role in the developing female brain is thus a by-product of its &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt;, rather than presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unborn babies’ brains are also shielded from the influence of maternal oestrogens (made by their mother and the placenta) by a molecule called alpha-fetoprotein, which is made in the liver of an unborn baby. It binds to oestrogen in the bloodstream and prevents maternal oestrogen crossing into the baby’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, oestrogen is involved in organising the architecture of the &lt;em&gt;male &lt;/em&gt;brain. Testosterone easily passes into unborn baby boy’s brains where it is converted to oestradiol by an enzyme called aromatase. It is now well established the ‘female’ hormone oestradiol is responsible for ‘masculinising’ the male brain in utero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother Nature is selfish. And she also has a sense of humour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from Chapter One of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Later in the chapter, I explain why &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; sex differences in achievement in maths, interest in technology subjects or ability in the sciences cannot be attributed to the presence (or absence) of testosterone in the womb. In sum: the role of hormones can be enhanced or entirely eliminated by how girls and boys are raised.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/11/does-depression-accelerate-aging/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A clear association between depression, especially the major depressive disorder, oxidative stress, and accelerated aging is supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression, major depressive disorder more specifically, is one of the most striking problems of modern society. Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression, with many patients not experiencing relief from symptoms. Depression is associated with increased mortality from age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Researchers have suggested that depression is associated with increased oxidative stress and a disturbed immune response, which may accelerate aging and increase susceptibility to age-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the proven indicators of cellular aging is the length of telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the end of chromosomal DNA and serve to protect chromosomal integrity. They become shorter with each round of replication and cell division, meaning that normally they become shorter with age. When telomeres reach a critically short length, the cells undergo apoptosis, i.e., programmed death. Leukocyte telomere length has been typically used in clinical studies as a marker of cellular aging. They shortening accelerates in the cells subjected to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies, including some meta-analysis, have questioned the association between leukocyte telomere length and major depressive disorder. For instance, one meta-analysis compared the length of telomeres between depressed and healthy individuals and found significantly shorter telomeres in groups with depression. A very recent prospective study including over 100 participants aged from 18 to 70 with or without major depressive disorder assessed telomere length at baseline and at two years follow-up. The authors concluded that individuals with major depressive disorder at baseline had significantly larger shortening of telomeres over the period of 2 years, supporting the association between depression and accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder is typically classified as a mental illness, but its pathology is evident in cells throughout the body. According to some researchers, several biological mediators are deregulated in this disorder that contribute to accelerated aging. These changes affect levels of genetic and epigenetic mediators (i.e., the variants of genes), and biochemical mediators such as glucocorticoids and neurosteroids. This can alter immune functions, oxidative processes, and levels of factors regulating the metabolism of glucose and production of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that deregulation of some of these biological mediators leads to oxidative stress, which seems to be highly correlated with the aging process. Oxidative damage occurs when the body can’t cope with psychological and physical stressors. In other words, oxidative stress refers to the excessive production of free radicals that cannot be completely neutralized by the body’s antioxidative mechanisms. Elevated markers of oxidative stress, along with  decreased antioxidant capacity, have been reported in subjects with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage is associated with the aging process, while markers of oxidative stress correlate with the decreased activity of an enzyme called telomerase. This enzyme is responsible for extending the length of telomeres. When telomerase is absent, the telomeres shorten faster. Thus, the link between the depression and accelerated aging can partly be explained by an increased cellular oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have also been conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder-mediated accelerated aging. For instance, in one study, the researchers exposed rats to mild chronic stress in order to induce the symptoms of major depressive disorder. The animals that developed these symptoms were found to have shorter telomeres and decreased telomerase activity, along with an increase in oxidative damage and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. In addition, damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial DNA content were also reported in rats with depressive symptoms. This research provided clear cellular evidence of accelerated aging associated with major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers proposed that early treatment (i.e., in the first half of life) of psychiatric disorders, including depression, could extend life expectancy and significantly reduce the burden of age-related disorders (such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer). They demonstrated that the persistence of some psychiatric disorder from the ages of 11 to 38 years led to the dose-dependent shortening of telomere length by the age of 38. Analyses of blood samples collected at the age of 26 and 38 revealed an accelerated erosion of telomeric ends in males diagnosed with the psychiatric disorder such as depression. Interestingly, there was no such association in females with a psychiatric disorder in the interim assessment at the age of 26. This research points to the link between psychiatric disorders and accelerated biological aging, which may be particularly emphasized in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one study investigated the association between major depressive disorder and age-related changes of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures involved in reward processing, which is often dysfunctional in subjects with major depressive disorder. Based on images from the brains of patients with depression and healthy controls, the authors assessed the grey matter volume of basal ganglia in their different parts. They found a negative correlation between the size of the putamen (a region of the basal ganglia located in the base of the forebrain) and age. Importantly, this association was twice as big in patients with major depressive disorder in comparison with healthy subjects. The finding of a greater age-related volume decrease in the depressed subjects, suggests that major depressive syndrome is clearly associated with accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that although various biochemical mediators are responsible for the clear association between depression and accelerated aging, oxidative stress is the largest contributor to this phenomenon. Thus, it is most likely that cellular oxidative damage caused by different psychological and physical stressors represents the underlying mechanism of depression-related accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Reverse Nearest Neighbor Queries: emergence and implementation issues</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;K-Nearest Neighbor, KNN is well-known tool in data mining. KNN query returns objects in a data set that are nearest to a query object-q.  One of the shortcomings of KNN is that it is asymmetric. That is, the fact that a query point q has a data point p as its nearest neighbor does not imply that p’s nearest neighbor is q.  There may be the case in decision support system where we concern on finding influence set for a query object q. For example, opening  a new outlet of company A at particular location is more based on the segment of customers of company B ( competitor of A) who are likely to find new outlet more convenient that the location of B.  Such segments of customers can loosely refer as influence set and the reverse relationship is addressed by reverse nearest neighbor, RNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Deepak will go through some of the papers on the implementation of RNN queries.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>There is a growing research literature on the 'Neuroscience of Love'. But what exactly is this 'love' that is being studied?





Sociologist Gabriel Abend asks these questions in a new paper called The Love of Neuroscience published in Sociological Theory. Last year I discussed one of Abend's previous papers which asked more general questions about how neuroscientists define the objects they study. In the new paper, Abend looks specifically at 'love' and how this word has been understood</description>

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: PLOS ONE and Children’s Tumor Foundation partnership announce second cycle of DDIRR Awards</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8233</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/C33JDGXkqLE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the largest non-governmental funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and PLOS ONE, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to announce the successful completion of the first funding cycle of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Report (DDIRR) 2017 Awards, a funder-publisher partnership integrating the Registered Reports model into the grant application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered Reports pre-determine the research questions, methodology and design of a study to be carried out, and are designed to enhance the rigor, reproducibility and transparency of the science produced. CTF and PLOS ONE partnered together to review the 2017 DDIRR applications and granted three awards: Dr. Andrea McClatchey of Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Lei Xu of Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dr. Aaron Schindeler from the University of Sydney. The researchers also obtained an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal PLOS ONE. Provided the study is conducted according to plan, acceptance in principle is honored regardless of study outcome – thereby eliminating publication bias and maximizing the transparency of the funded work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports are being placed on the Open Science Framework registered report portal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/rr/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://osf.io/rr/&lt;/a&gt;), where authors will have the opportunity to make public or embargo their reports until publication of results. The awards have a duration of 12 months and will conclude in May 2019. As soon as results are added to the registered report, PLOS ONE will review compliance with the proposed protocol and publish their results, even if they are negative. By securing publication before they start their research, applicants can eliminate the bias of a result-based approach. The process was designed to maintain independence of funding and publishing decisions, while at the same time optimizing processes, thereby avoiding duplication and preventing research waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new award constitutes an evolution of the Drug Discovery Initiative (DDI) Awards that CTF had introduced in 2006 as a funding program for promising ideas that could lead to larger studies or move drugs into the clinic. Feedback on the new DDIRR program from both applicants and reviewers has been unanimously positive, and the Foundation together with PLOS ONE editors have also announced a new cycle for DDIRR in 2018-2019. The Foundation will invite applicants to submit their proposals starting on September 24, 2018, with the anticipated assignment of new awards in the first quarter of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The overall outcome of this first round of DDIRR has been very positive. Reviewers have focused their attention to protocols and study designs, allowing researchers to have their statistics ready for publication,” said Salvatore La Rosa, Ph.D., Vice President of Research and Development for the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “As this particular grant program focuses on hypothesis-testing research, the quality and rigor of the applications are critical to soundly move proof-of-concept experiments from the lab into the clinic. This new program increases our ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to continue our collaboration with CTF on the Registered Reports model for the DDI Awards. We hope this can serve as a model for other funders. The Registered Reports provide researchers with peer reviewed study designs and an in-principle acceptance of the completed study at PLOS ONE. The deposited reports at the Open Science Framework portal ensure full transparency of the research project – a win for everyone involved,” adds Joerg Heber, Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Studying mass murder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=138474</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550863108/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, 40 to 60 million defenseless people were massacred in episodes of genocide. The 21st century is not faring much better, with mass murder ongoing e.g. in Myanmar and Syria. Many of these cases have been studied well, both in detailed case studies and in comparative perspectives, but studying mass murder is no picnic. Scholars have also examined how &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520089945&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conducting research&lt;/a&gt;, including ethnographic fieldwork, archival investigation, and oral history interviews, can affect the researcher in profound ways. Among a broader set of difficulties that obstruct research on this wretched subject, two stand out in particular: political constraints and psychological attrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political constraints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All social research operates in a dense political field. Of all the political actors constraining research on mass murder, states stand out. They often have a vested interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.nl/books?id=A0QlDwAAQBAJ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misrepresenting the truth&lt;/a&gt;, because for many, the memory of a genocide (or its denial), is part and parcel of their collective identity. States that consider themselves heirs to perpetrator regimes, such as Turkey, Russia, Indonesia, China, or Serbia, make great effort to influence the scholarship on episodes of mass violence. They deny access to archival collections and libraries, intimidate and prohibit them from conducting field work. (The opposite is also possible: governments may try to foster or manipulate research by funding politically useful research, by pushing for the establishment of academic chairs at home or abroad, or by offering scholarships.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to contend with the taboos, restrictions, prescriptions, and outright threats of authoritarian regimes keeps scholars working on these topics under &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.2016.97.issue-4/issuetoc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;permanent threat&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers bold enough to travel into these societies to visit sites, uncover evidence, interview witnesses, and have got to fear the security services and intelligence agencies of these states. One consequence of this discouraging atmosphere is that, in general, less research is carried out on those instances and episodes of mass murder, an undesirable blind spot due to the importance of the events. (Some researchers ingratiate themselves with the authorities for privileged access.) A second consequence poses a methodological dilemma: due to such constraints, does one launch a sting operation, like undercover journalism? Or does one use informants, fixers, and mediators on the ground? Does one pay the possible interviewees for taking the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt; We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are significant emotional consequences of studying mass murder. All social research also operates in a dense emotional and moral field. As a general problem in the academy, involvement and detachment has been dealt with at some length, but the study of mass violence is particularly relevant from this perspective. Though a certain amount of passion and involvement can facilitate one’s commitment to the topic, it requires a great deal of detachment to sift through documents and memoirs containing very intimate details of killing. Detachment is even more challenging in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14525.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews&lt;/a&gt;, as empathy can transmit to scholars the interviewees’ powerful negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, I began interviewing Syrians about their experiences with violence, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://niod.nl/en/news/new-research-project-syrians%E2%80%99-experiences-mass-violence-and-dynamic-violent-conflict&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a large-scale oral history project&lt;/a&gt; we are launching in the Netherlands. Having interviewed about 80 survivors and eye witnesses so far, their emotions of anger, sadness, fear, survivor guilt, and anxiety has affected me irreversibly. These types of interviews can be an alienating and isolating experience: the more one is absorbed into the stories of the eye witnesses, the more one is also drawn into their emotions. As a general rule of thumb, I felt compassion when interviewing victims, and indignation when interviewing perpetrators. But the interviews left a mark long after I stopped recording. When one young woman from Aleppo told me that she was raped in an ambush and witnessed a beheading up close, I was aghast at that moment. Ever since, I have not mustered my courage to go over those particular interview transcripts and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the risks of political threats and psychological attrition need to be taken seriously by academic institutions, journals, and colleagues. These constraints can produce setbacks and potentially lower productivity, even with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/11/on-burnout-trauma-erin-jessee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appropriate self-care&lt;/a&gt;. We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Science Exchange First &amp; Only R&amp;D Outsourcing Platform to Achieve HIPAA Compliance</title>

	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/06/science-exchange-first-only-rd-outsourcing-platform-to-achieve-hipaa-compliance/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HIPAA-PR-Social-Image-1200x628.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;HIPAA Compliance at Science Exchange&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1356&quot; height=&quot;156&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HIPAA-PR-Social-Image-1200x628-300x156.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;HIPAA Compliance Demonstrates Commitment by Science Exchange to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Protection and Privacy of Protected Health Information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PALO ALTO CA, June 7, 2018 –&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; today announced that it is the first R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform to achieve HIPAA compliance as required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under 45 C.F.R. 164. This achievement demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by 45 CFR §160.103 and shared by its customers and scientific research providers on the Science Exchange platform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “Protecting sensitive patient health information is a top priority for our clients and research providers,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “Achieving HIPAA compliance was a crucial step for Science Exchange, given the increasing portability and complexity of data processed by our software platform.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIPAA and HITECH: Noncompliance costing millions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act limit the disclosure of patient PHI, including data processed by any provider, technology platform, or other contractor. Since 2010, enforcement of HIPAA and HITECH has increased — with individual fines for noncompliance as high as $2 million. HIPAA compliance helps protect Science Exchange’s clients from these potential consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science Exchange achieved HIPAA compliance by:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establishing Business Associate Agreements for proper use and disclosure of PHI: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Business Associate Agreements are required agreements between covered entities and their business associates, such as Science Exchange, whose activities involve access to PHI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards against improper disclosures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Training every employee on protecting information subject to HIPAA and HIPAA requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Adopting best practices for limiting information use and sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry leaders in data privacy, security, and quality assurance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In addition to being the only HIPAA-compliant R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform, Science Exchange is also the only outsourcing platform to have earned EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification. This certification ensures compliance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/gdpr-plan&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations&lt;/a&gt; that went into effect on May 25, 2018, thereby protecting the many R&amp;amp;D organizations that have enterprise-level agreements with Science Exchange. Science Exchange is also SOC 2-compliant and ISO 9001-certified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OUPblog - Psychology and Neuroscience: Safe and supportive schools for LGBTQ-GNC students</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.oup.com/?p=138297</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550638442/0/oupblogpsychology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within its first month, the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines designed to promote protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or gender non-conforming youth (LGBTQ-GNC) public school students. This move received significant media attention, much of which focused on the challenges of growing up LGBTQ-GNC, and the unique role of schools as places that should be safe and supportive for all students. At issue is defining the rights of students to be protected based on LGBT-GNC identity or status. And yet these rights are regularly compromised through: harassment and victimization that is unchecked; unfair, punitive, and exclusionary discipline practices; and unequal access to supports, services, and curriculum that validate their identities and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uslgbt/toc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hatred in the Hallways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;documented pervasive human rights violations perpetrated against LGBT youth in US schools. More recently, through an international convening and report, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) firmly documented homophobic and transphobic violence as a global issue that has critical implications for positive development, health, and academic success of children and adolescence. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~en.unesco.org/themes/school-violence-and-bullying/homophobic-transphobic-violence&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UNESCO report&lt;/a&gt; argued that bullying generally, and bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) specifically, comprise a threat to the universal right to education established in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. This groundbreaking report provided a comprehensive review of the international literature on SOGI-related bullying in schools and documented the disproportionate rates of bullying for LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries on every continent across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the landscape regarding human rights affordances, constraints, and abuses related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is constantly in flux, any discussion of the SOGI rights of young people must take into account this larger global context. The rights of LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries where the expression of same-sex sexuality is criminalized are virtually non-existent; further, human rights violations against LGBTQ-GNC youth occur within most countries across the globe and are often justified by cultural and social norms and conventions regarding “acceptable or normal” definitions of sexuality and gender. While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people. While several advances have been made in the last decade to advance the rights of LGBTQ-GNC people across the globe (for example see the 2006 Yogykarta Principles and the 2011 Human Rights Council’s resolution on LGBTQ-GNC rights) these documents rarely attend to specific SOGI rights of &lt;em&gt;young people&lt;/em&gt; or put forth any particular considerations regarding children and youth (a notable exception is in relation to access to education).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding intersecting forms of oppression—such as the ways that structural oppression related to gender and sexuality and its intersections with race, ethnicity, class, and religion affect young people, their parents, and educators in schools—is essential for designing and implementing effective processes, strategies, programs, and advocacy aimed at creating positive change within school contexts. Many of the SOGI-related inequities evidenced in schools can be traced, in part, to narrow definitions of masculinity and femininity, rigid frameworks regarding gender and gender roles, and hegemonic structures in schools that mark heterosexuality as not only compulsory but also the sole valid expression of sexuality. Other forms of structural oppression rooted in racism, religious, or social class bias, are intertwined with SOGI issues in schools through inequitable discipline practices, religious control of public education, or economic disparities across schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because SOGI issues in schools are embedded within larger systems of oppression, it is critical that research, practice, and policy engage with social justice and anti-oppressive education frameworks. Such approaches bring to the fore the ways that power, privilege, and bias structure schools in ways that tacitly sanction a range of educational inequities such as bullying, access to resources and services, and safety for young people in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. As we continue to do this work, it has become increasingly evident that the SOGI safe schools movement is “inextricably linked” to broader education justice concerns. It is critical for the safe schools movement to work with others through intersectional, multi-issue coalitions—at the nexus of research, policy and practice—to ensure that all students’ educational rights, regardless of social position, are upheld. This type of cross-issue organizing, advocacy, and research takes time and needs to be grounded in the principals of the worth and dignity of all people, and that ensuring the rights of specific groups expands the rights of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Acupuncture and Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23733</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/05/acupuncture-and-pain/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is one of the oldest systems of traditional medicine. With roots in China, this medical system is more than 2000 years old. It differs from various other medical systems as it does not involve taking any herbs or substances. Instead, it involves inserting small needles at specific predefined points. From the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century onwards, it has continued to gain prominence in the Western world, although many remain skeptical about efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, researchers want to know the exact mechanism of action of any medical system. They only trust the therapy if it has been proven as effective in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Acupuncture has been the subject of many such trials, and its usefulness has been established in certain pain-associated conditions, mood disorders, and even in some diseases of internal organs. This led to the recognition of this medical system by many healthcare providers and medical organizations. In the US, acupuncture is recognized as complementary medicine. The WHO also recommends it for a number of specific medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical evidence of efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of clinical trials provide evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/21/the-science-of-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;the effectiveness of acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; in various medical conditions. Among the most relevant trials are the so-called German mega-trials named ARC, ART, COMP, and GERAC. The primary focus of these trials has been pain relief in various musculoskeletal conditions. GERAC and ART were high quality random clinical trials investigating low back pain. These trials compared real acupuncture with sham acupuncture and standard care. Sham acupuncture involved needling without the use of conventional acupuncture points. Whereas standard care included the use of physiotherapy, exercise therapy, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Results were measured after three months, and the response was defined as adequate if there was an improvement of more than 33% on the pain scale (the Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale). After 6-months, the response rate with real acupuncture was 47.6%, while it was 44.2% with sham acupuncture, and 27.4% with standard care. Though these trials clearly demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture, they also showed &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/29/there-is-no-sham-in-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;the effectiveness of sham acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers think that this phenomenon is linked to psychogenic factors involved with back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, similar results were also demonstrated in various trials in the US. Though these trials show the usefulness of acupuncture in painful conditions, they also illustrate the value of psychogenic factors. Therefore, it is not surprising that acupuncture had also proven its utility in treating mood disorders and sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chinese medicine, the use of acupuncture is not limited to pain-related conditions. Thus, there is need for more extensive trials across a diverse range of diseases. The existing data do indicate that acupuncture may be an alternative approach for many difficult to treat chronic ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas of debate regarding acupuncture has been the difficulty in explaining its mechanism of action. As per traditional explanation, acupuncture is used to correct the flow of energy (Qi) in the body. This life energy flows through the fixed paths or highways in our body called &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/02/03/a-primer-on-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;meridians&lt;/a&gt;. Practitioners of acupuncture believe that in disease conditions there is a blockade of energy highways or meridians. Acupuncture is about creating the balance between the internal forces called Yin and Yang. However, the trouble is that modern science is not able to demonstrate or even understand the concepts of Qi, Yin, Yang, and Meridians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, practitioners of modern science have made various attempts to explain the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and they came up with multiple theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable effects of acupuncture&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the explanations is that needling does cause local changes and alterations in reflexes. It also has systemic effects, as it changes the working of the autonomous nervous system. Thus, acupuncture affects blood pressure, heart rate, levels of various hormones, and changes the levels of neurotransmitters. All of this results in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/&quot;&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; and other beneficial effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local mechanotransduction&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a theory promoted by a French physician in 1961, who wrote that acupuncture points have lower local resistance when compared to surrounding skin. He wrote that while normal dry skin has a resistance of 200,000 to 2 million Ohms, acupuncture points have a resistance of just 50,000 Ohms. The believers in this theory say that acupuncture causes minute traumas at the points of needle insertion and thus stimulates survival mechanisms of the body. Needling stimulates homeostasis, anti-inflammatory responses, tissue regeneration, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurohumoral theory&lt;/strong&gt;: it has been demonstrated that acupuncture is useful in pain relief, and naloxone blocks its analgesic effect. Thus, researchers propose that needling at specific points leads to the release of endogenous painkilling &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/&quot;&gt;opiate-like substances&lt;/a&gt; such as enkephalins, endorphins, dynorphins and some other neurotransmitters like serotonin and noradrenaline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate-control theory&lt;/strong&gt;: This theory states that needling stimulates large myelinated nerve fibers. These fibers carry tingling sensations and feelings of warmth, and can inhibit the painful sensation that is transmitted to the brain by much smaller C-fibers via spinal tracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postsynaptic inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;: This is another explanation, which states that acupuncture results in the inhibition of pain through a central mechanism via disinhibition of RAF. This phenomenon typically works in cases of extreme trauma like loss of limb. This central mechanism has a role in protecting the body from extreme stress and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous nervous system&lt;/strong&gt;: Proponents of this theory suggest that acupuncture works by changing the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphogenetic singularity theory&lt;/strong&gt;: This is one of the more complicated hypotheses that tries to explain the existence of meridians. Advocates of this theory explain the presence of non-neural communication pathways in the body. During embryonic development, when neurons are not yet formed, cells must communicate among themselves to direct development. Meridians are just the remains of these early communication paths, which are still present in the adult body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization&lt;/strong&gt;: In recent years, fMRI methods have advanced a lot, and in many clinical studies it has been demonstrated that stimulation of various acupuncture points by needling results in activation of different brain centers, thus explaining the mechanism of action of acupuncture. It is believed that both the elements of morphogenetic singularity theory (meridians) and components of the neurohumoral response are involved in the stimulation of the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that various theories have been used to describe the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and most probably there is more than one mechanism is involved. Clinical trials do seem to indicate that acupuncture is beneficial in specific health conditions. But the way it works still remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
