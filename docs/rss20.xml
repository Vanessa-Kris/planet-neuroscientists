	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Annals of Emergency Medicine has republished a controversial paper it withdrew earlier this year which compared the cost of emergency care at different types of facilities. Because the paper drew heavy criticism when it was originally released, the journal has published a revised version, along with several editorials and discussions between the authors and […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Chris Dames thought he had made an exciting discovery, a “secret sauce” that would allow him to design a device using a novel mechanism. In a 2014 Nature Communications paper, Dames—who works at the University of California at Berkeley—and his team described the first experimental results for the device, a photon thermal […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believed the copious alarmist commentary in the newspapers, you’d fear for the future of our species. Today’s children, we’re told, are more hyperactive and technology addicted than ever before. They’ve lost any ability to sit still, instead craving constant stimulation from digital devices and exhausted parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might this mean for their performance on the most famous psychological measure of childhood self-control, Walter Mischel’s Marshmallow Test? Surely, kids of today will struggle far more than previous generations to resist the lure of one marshmallow (or other treat) now for the promise of two in ten minutes or so, as the task requires? In a new survey, the majority of child development experts certainly believed so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet based on his analysis of 50 years worth of performance data on the Marshmallow Test – &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/jghdm/&quot;&gt;released as a preprint at the Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt; – John Protzko at the University of California, Santa Barbara, concludes that in fact children of today are capable of more self-restraint than previous generations, with their ability to delay gratification having increased by about a minute per decade over the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30244&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko combined the results from every published and unpublished use of the Marshmallow Test that he could find, starting with Mischel’s seminal work first published in 1968 and including 4 studies in the 1970s, 3 in the 1990s, 6 in the 2000s, and 16 in our current decade, all involving children aged ten or younger. Protzko speculates that the gap in the 1980s is due to the introduction at that time of a rival test of self-regulation which is quicker to administer – the so-called gift-delay task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before crunching the numbers, Protzko polled 260 members of the Cognitive Development Society Listserv about how they thought the results would come out. Just over 50 per cent predicted that Protzko would find children’s powers of self-restraint would be lower today than the in past; 20 per cent predicted no change over time; and just 16 per cent believed that children today would outperform the children of the past (the others said there wouldn’t be enough data to answer the question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protzko found a statistically significant linear trend – children’s ability to resist immediate temptation and wait for a greater reward seems to have increased over the decades (this remained true when removing two study outliers, marked as black circles in the graph above). The increase in delay of gratification ability is similar in size to the known increase in average IQ seen over the same timescale, possibly reflecting shared mechanisms, though this is speculation at this stage. Meanwhile, variation in Marshmallow Test performance has stayed the same over the decades, which means that average improvement has been seen across the spread of ability, not just among those children who are more self-restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could the experts have got it so wrong? Protzko’s suggests they are prone to same bias as the rest of us, what he calls the “kids these days” phenomenon: “people’s memories for their own and others’ abilities in childhood are unduly influenced by their current abilities. While it is easy to look at kids these days and deride their inability to control themselves and decry the downfall of civilisation, it is much harder to accurately recall our own selves as children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the apparent improvement in children’s powers of self-control bode well for the future, for instance in terms of reduced criminality and addiction? Protzko thinks not, speculating that it is probably one’s ability relative to others, rather than one’s absolute ability, that is relevant to future behaviour – the lowest performers will remain at risk, he suggests. “These [unhealthy and dangerous] behaviours have been with humans for thousands of years, and will be with us for thousands more,” he predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes and consequences of the apparent increase in children’s powers of self-restraint over time remain to be uncovered by future research. For now, Protzko says the data show that “Contrary to historical and present complaints, kids these days appear to be better than we were. A supposed modern culture of instant gratification has not stemmed the march of improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Facing a volley of criticism for publishing an essay that called for a return to colonialism, a journal editor has defended his decision to print the article. “The Case for Colonialism,” published Sept. 8 in Third World Quarterly (TWQ), was written by Bruce Gilley, a professor of political science at Portland State University.

At a personal level I don't understand all the hubbub,  because I accepted that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;mind = brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when I entered graduate school to study neuroscience. But for others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Coming to terms with the neural basis of who we are can be very  unnerving. It has been called &lt;b&gt;“neuroexistentialism”&lt;/b&gt;, which really  captures the essence of it. We’re not in the habit of thinking about  ourselves that way” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029450-200-the-benefits-of-realising-youre-just-a-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Churchland, 2013&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's very 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2CWu6CYD-g/WbrGkZexAKI/AAAAAAAAMQI/ZJmKSikslpcMYeG9fnZgGmCwJBqyymCZACLcBGAs/s1600/Neuroexistentialism%2Bcover.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;805&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2CWu6CYD-g/WbrGkZexAKI/AAAAAAAAMQI/ZJmKSikslpcMYeG9fnZgGmCwJBqyymCZACLcBGAs/s400/Neuroexistentialism%2Bcover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neuroexistentialism &lt;/i&gt;is also the title of a forthcoming volume of essays edited by Caruso and Flanagan. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroexistentialism: Third-Wave Existentialism&quot;&gt;introductory chapter&lt;/a&gt;, Flanagan and Caruso define this philosophical variant in the progression of existentialisms to the present third-wave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“There are three kinds of existentialism that respond to three different kinds of grounding projects—grounding in God’s nature, in a shared vision of the collective good, or in science. The first-wave existentialism of Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche expressed anxiety about the idea that meaning and morals are made secure because of God’s omniscience and good will. The second-wave existentialism of Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, was a post-holocaust response to the idea that some uplifting secular vision of the common good might serve as a foundation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today, there is a third-wave existentialism, neuroexistentialism, which expresses the anxiety that even as science yields the truth about human nature it also disenchants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The theory of evolution together with advances in neuroscience remove the last vestiges of an immaterial soul or self that can know the nature of what is really true, good, and beautiful.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don't understand why the neuroscientific view must be so disenchanting. (But then again I'm a neuroscientist.) I knew fellow students who went to church yet easily reconciled their cell culture day jobs with their religious beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patriciachurchland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Patricia Churchland&lt;/a&gt; is the best at explaining the “Don't Worry, Be Happy” response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029450-200-the-benefits-of-realising-youre-just-a-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuroexistential terror&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q - Some might say the idea that you are just your brain makes life  bleak, unforgiving and ultimately futile. How do you respond to that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A - It’s  not at all bleak. I don’t see how the existence of a god or a soul  confers any meaning on my life. How does that work, exactly? Nobody has  ever given an adequate answer. My life is meaningful because I have  family, meaningful work, because I love to play, I have dogs, I love to  dig in the garden. That’s what makes my life meaningful, and I think  that’s true for most people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s1600/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;358&quot; data-original-width=&quot;792&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G4gwOM9GYa4/Wb_K8HY86II/AAAAAAAAMQY/cm6IOrNZJggept7SeKxUrE-B-PvJCZwxQCLcBGAs/s400/Neuroexistentialism%2Bchapter%2Btitles_Wordle%2BE2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Word cloud for the 18 chapter titles in &lt;i&gt;Neuroexistentialism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scope of Neuroexistentialsim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, it's about free will, morality, meaning, and purpose. And of course neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my puzzlement about who suffers from a modern-day ailment caused by science spoilers. I found the below sentence to be both condescending and hyperbolic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;But for most ordinary folk and many members of the nonscientific academy, the idea that humans are animal and that the mind is the brain is destabilizing and disenchanting, quite possibly nauseating, a source of dread, fear and trembling, sickness unto death even.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the authors overascribe the illness and exaggerate the depth of ennui experienced by “most ordinary folk” who are too busy to grapple with the scientific implications of social neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don't mean to be overly snarky but right now I'm grappling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;, and with second-wave existential crises caused by crazed leaders with bad hair who wave around their phallic symbols of nuclear destruction, and with persisting racism that divides the country, and with the hypocrisy of anti-immigration Christians, and with a future of toxic air and coastal regions underwater. Maybe what I'm experiencing is actually fourth-wave existentialism...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f1gxkcHHQGc/WcDJhSZpU7I/AAAAAAAAMQ8/DXcd3fjL4GoN5Cmiiv9ftX5AxVBgrTsEgCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BCircle%2Bof%2BNeuroexistentialism.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;450&quot; data-original-width=&quot;489&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f1gxkcHHQGc/WcDJhSZpU7I/AAAAAAAAMQ8/DXcd3fjL4GoN5Cmiiv9ftX5AxVBgrTsEgCLcBGAs/s320/The%2BCircle%2Bof%2BNeuroexistentialism.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medicating Neuroexistential Angst&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If neuroexistentialism is a narrow form of generalized anxiety or even panic, can't we use our scientific knowledge to sooth these troubled brains? Why not apply psychopharmacological principles (and/or psychotherapy) to calm the fearful and trembling mind? We have already presupposed that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;mind = brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (which brought us “sickness unto death even”), and that medications can alter brain function in psychiatric disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not the correct way forward (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a7bde946734350a2b5f0ddece6253922?AccessKeyId=57C0F200619988621A8D&amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;alloworigin=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flanagan and Caruso&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“...Are there naturalistic resources that can quell the anxiety produced by the ascendancy of the scientific image generally, and specifically, the picture that comes from combining neo-Darwinism with neuroscience, which produces the new and nerve-wracking anxiety associated with neuroexistentialism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One promising approach is to pursue a kind of descriptive-normative inquiry into the causes and conditions of flourishing for material beings living in a material world, whose self-understanding includes the idea that such a world is the only kind of world that there is and thus that the meaning and significance of their lives, if there is any, must be found in such a world. We can call such an inquiry&lt;i&gt; eudaimonics&lt;/i&gt; (Flanagan 2007, 2009).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the solution to third-wave existentialism is positive psychology (as opposed to despair).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism#Despair&quot;&gt;Despair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the   conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is   in even when he isn't overtly in despair. So long as a person's   identity depends on qualities that can crumble, he is considered to be   in perpetual despair. And as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human   essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the   individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s1600/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;884&quot; data-original-width=&quot;614&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5FxrY_grQI/WcDTItcObdI/AAAAAAAAMRM/PcDmavBzIZcx8eS1dEiK-t_xx2QM3-3YACLcBGAs/s400/Being%2Band%2BNothingness1.png&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/existential-neuroscience-field-in.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Existential Neuroscience: a field in search of meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in 2013, the field of Existential Neuroscience (distinct from Neuroexistentialism) took the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;SCAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by storm, with neuroimaging studies focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terror management theory&lt;/a&gt; (which describes how we deal with the inevitability of death).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some brains struck by pathology seem to stave off its effects thanks to a “cognitive reserve”: a superior use of mental resources that may be related to the way we use our brains over a lifetime, for instance through high levels of education or, possibly, learning a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilingual people certainly seem to use their brains differently. For example, practice at switching languages has been associated with enhanced mental control. It’s even been claimed that being bilingual can stave off dementia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/100218-bilingual-brains-alzheimers-dementia-science-aging/&quot;&gt;up to four or five years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, this would have serious implications for public policy – learning a second language would be as much a desirable health behaviour as it is an educational or cultural one. But are the brain benefits of bilingualism real? The &lt;i&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/i&gt; has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170131&quot;&gt;a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; to establish the strength of the evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30079&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University College London research team, led by Naaheed Mukadam, surveyed hundreds of papers published up to November 2016, finding fourteen high-quality studies that measured dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment (a more subtle analogue and frequent precursor of dementia) as well as participants’ status as either mono-lingual or bilingual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the studies drew their conclusions from patients who had attended clinics complaining of memory problems, and their results were in favour of bilingualism. In one study, the age of diagnosis for amnesic mild cognitive impairment was around four to five years later for bilingual patients compared to monolingual. Another five studies asked when people began noticing their symptoms, and these also found the similar four to five year delay for bilinguals. Two of the eight found no significant effects, but the preponderance of evidence here looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, all of these papers were retrospective, and depended on when people decided to show up to a clinic, and/or their accurate dating of when their symptoms began. Complicating matters is the fact that bilingual people from minority ethnic backgrounds are known to seek help later for dementia, on average, probably for social and cultural reasons. Moreover, these studies rarely controlled for education, which tends to be higher for non-minority multi-linguals, and as education itself contributes to cognitive reserve, this may be another confound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better controlled studies that identify a sample of people free from dementia and then follow them in the future are easier to interpret. Mukadam’s team identified five such studies. These found that five years after recruitment there were no significant differences between bilingual and monolingual participants in terms of whether they had developed any memory problems or neurological diagnoses. A meta-analysis using the raw diagnosis numbers from each study – a total of just over 5,000 participants – confirmed that bilingualism does not stave off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a weak evidence base doesn’t mean an effect isn’t real. Indeed, more recent research from a team of Italian researchers used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/7/1690.full&quot;&gt;neuroimaging techniques&lt;/a&gt; to make a more systematic case for the benefits of bilingualism, including that it is associated with greater neural connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Italian work is too recent to feature in the new review, but it’s notable that it escapes some of the methodological problems discussed above. However, when I brought this to Naaheed Makadem (the lead author of the new review), she raised a few considerations: firstly, that the new neuroimaging study investigated people who were generally lifelong bilinguals, living in a bilingual context (the Italian-German borderlands of Italy), which affords more opportunities for lifelong mode-switching than would be found for cases of adult migration or deciding to pick up a new language; secondly, she points to other potential confounding factors, such as employment and social status (i.e. the apparent neural advantages of bilinguals might be related to their being more likely to be in employment and higher social status).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi-lingual mind may have important consequences, but it’s not clear that recommendations to learn a second language later in life will necessarily produce the protections that have been claimed. Makadem’s team conclude their work by suggesting that “public health policy should therefore remove recommendations regarding bilingualism as a strategy to delay dementia and instead concentrate on more generally reducing cognitive inactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Science Exchange Blog: Science Exchange Survey Reveals Pain Points of Outsourcing R&amp;D</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1129</guid>
	<link>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/09/science-exchange-survey-reveals-pain-points-of-outsourcing-rd/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contract review, service provider qualification, and security of intellectual property among major concerns for biotech and pharma leaders surveyed at 2017 industry conferences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.– More than 100 biotechnology and drug development leaders who responded to surveys conducted during industry conferences earlier this year reported a wide range of barriers to the outsourcing of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) services, including the contracts review process, intellectual property (IP) security concerns, and service provider qualification. The surveys were conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceexchange.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51684706&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170918005083&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Science+Exchange&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=d9ebe5ccb2e80e5f010a479455ac2f70&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading and most secure platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;amp;D), during the 2017 Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) International Convention and 2017 Drug Industry Association (DIA) Global Annual Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 75 percent of Science Exchange survey respondents ranked the following concerns as barriers (a significant barrier or somewhat of a barrier) to the outsourcing of R&amp;amp;D services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Having contracts reviewed and signed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Security of IP;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Identifying service providers with required expertise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Qualifying service providers; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;Negotiating pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management related to R&amp;amp;D outsourcing was also reported as having a significant impact on these R&amp;amp;D leaders, with over 40 percent of those responding to the survey indicating they spent more than 20 hours to onboard each new outsourcing partner, from the request for proposal process, through contracting and start of the project. Finally, further demonstrating the impact of the time spent on administrative tasks related to outsourcing, more than 75 percent of survey respondents reported that the “hassle” of bringing on a new partner has previously led them to choose an existing vendor rather than seek out a more qualified option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This results of this survey echo the same concerns we heard from the leading biotech and pharma companies who now rely on Science Exchange to help them efficiently manage their outsourced R&amp;amp;D services,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “In review of enterprise clients’ experiences, we find that our Science Exchange clients save thousands of work hours each year on procurement, business operations, contracting and legal resources, and administrative tasks related to outsourcing — time that can instead be spent in discovery. It’s gratifying to see that we’re able to fulfill our goal to support the scientific discovery process by removing barriers to innovation for our clients.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Neuroscience Community: When neurogenesis goes wrong…</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19441</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/VUT_ywAeuoY/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/09/PLOSOne-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is a complex biological process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Indeed, the discovery of a dynamic neurogenesis in the adult brain (in both humans and animals) was a kind of extraordinary revelation. In fact, contrary to common popular belief, neurogenesis continuously occurs in specific regions in the adult brain, such as in the hippocampus and the striatum. Neurogenesis occurs in both physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
In the hippocampus, newly born granule cells (GC) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) migrate in the granule cell layer and become functionally integrated into neuronal networks within four to six weeks. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that newborn neurons generated in the context of cerebral ischemia may fail to correctly integrate into pre-existing networks. However, the cellular mechanisms of how ischemic infarcts cause alteration of hippocampal functions are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory, neurogenesis and morphological alterations following cerebral stroke &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183463&quot;&gt;PLOS One article&lt;/a&gt;, Woitke and collegues (Jena University Hospital, Germany) hypothesized that increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following stroke may be associated with aberrant neurogenic activity and impaired hippocampus-dependent functions. This might sound somehow counterintuitive, since one would expect that increased neurogenesis may lead to improved cognitive functions. But this is not the case, or at least it does not represent the full and exact picture of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is well known that cerebral stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, although the functional role of this post-lesion response is mostly unclear. In a physiological context, neurogenesis is strictly regulated and less than 1% of new neurons have aberrant connections in the intact brain. Things may be different following brain damage and insults (strokes, seizures, etc). Using behavioral and viral approaches “&lt;em&gt;we now prove,&lt;/em&gt;” says Woitke, the leading author of the study, “&lt;em&gt;that aberrant neurogenesis also occurs in the murine hippocampus and is associated with poorer performance in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks following focal infarcts.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a first attempt, Woitke and colleagues performed the Morris Water Maze (MWM), a hippocampus-dependent behavioral task routinely used to assess spatial memory functions. Parameters such as latencies (“time to find the platform”) and distance (“path lengths”) to navigate to the platform were analyzed. As expected, brain ischemic mice generally needed more time to locate the platform, thus suggesting impaired learning and memory functions. In addition, analysis of the adaptive learning strategies in both groups revealed that animals with stroke used a less efficient navigation strategy to find the platform, while hippocampal-dependent strategies were employed more frequently by the control group. When looking at neurogenesis processes the authors observed an increased number of new born neurons in the hippocampus of mice with stroke. Thus, in a second set of experiments, the authors addressed the question of whether the newly generated neurons may have aberrant morphology and location, which in turn may be related to malfunction of hippocampal networks and circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Using retroviral labeling, we detected a significant number of new GC with atypical morphology and dendritic branching following ischemia,&lt;/em&gt;” says Silke Keiner, the senior author of the study. In particular, GC displayed an additional dendritic tree extending from the basal pole towards the hilus (a specific subregion of the dentate gyrus) which is considered a typical immature feature of GC neurons. Taken together, ischemia increases the number of newborn neurons but promotes aberrant dendritic branching indicating maladaptive plasticity in the DG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that integrated and functional neurons require dendritic spines. Interestingly, the expression of mature mushroom spines by aberrant newborn cells strongly suggests that these neurons are synaptically integrated, thus being able to influence and alter hippocampal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this study reveals that even a low number of aberrant neurons may severely affect hippocampal functions such as learning and memory. However, the casual link among cellular modifications, neurogenesis and impaired memory functions is far from being fully elucidated. In fact, the analysis of the functional impact of adult neurogenesis in behavioral experiments or cognitive tasks is still quite challenging. As mentioned by the authors, “&lt;em&gt;more studies are needed to clarify whether tailored rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches might counteract aberrant neurogenesis and improve hippocampal-dependent memory performance.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: Decision-making: the Role of Neuronal Crowdsourcing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22834</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/18/decision-making-the-role-of-neuronal-crowdsourcing/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making, in most cases, is not a straightforward process. Facing contradictory facts and opinions, people often struggle to decide on the best way forward when a complicated problem needs to be solved. In human society, we eventually rely on two methods of decision-making: we can follow the will of the majority, or we can delegate the task of decision-making to a leader thus leaving all deliberations (and responsibilities) to this single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists ask: How does this works on the level of brain cells? If your brain has to make a decision, how do your individual neurons come to a unified conclusion? Do they use the “majority mechanism”? Or maybe there are some neurons whose “opinion” dominates the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter approach is known as a “grandmother theory”. Grandmother analogy was suggested in the 1960s to propagate the idea that the final decision about a single event may be taken by one dominant neuron. However, scientists also suggested that the process might be more “democratic” and involve the contribution of multiple neurons in generating the final outcome. This process is sometimes described as neuronal “crowdsourcing”.  The most recent data points to the possibility that both processes play a role in the human &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/01/the-neurology-of-anxiety-in-times-of-critical-decision-making/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to any decision is a complex mental process involving the weighing and choosing from a number of options, with each option having various characteristics. Decision-making is not a reflex action. When we make a decision there are some expected or foreseen consequences. And it is also important to note that in making any decision, we use the information that has been accumulated in our brain prior to the time of making that decision. Finally, every decision made involves &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/17/deciphering-troubled-teens-risk-taking-behavior/&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, as there is a degree of uncertainty around making decisions, and we are aware that many of these decisions can have long-term consequences. Although we know that decision-making plays a central part in our mental development, very little is known about how it occurs at the neuronal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision-making events are far more common than we tend to think. It is not simply deciding the way to take while &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/28/the-brain-road-link-new-evidence-on-cell-phones-and-driving/&quot;&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt;, or what food to have for a lunch. Decision-making is involved even in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/01/mind-your-dishes-mundane-tasks-to-improve-mental-health/&quot;&gt;easiest of tasks&lt;/a&gt;. What seems a simple task at first may have quite a complex mechanism underlying it. Just take any simple conversation as an example. Most words used in a conversation can have multiple meanings, and decisions regarding their appropriate use have to be taken at very high speed. These can be called momentous decisions: they do not require a high level of thinking and are often based on prior experience. At the neuronal level, such decisions are often taken by small groups of neurons or can even be taken by a single dominant neuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all decisions are momentous. Some decisions require a high level of thinking and calculation, and they require taking the long-term outcome of the decision into consideration. For long-term decision-making, we voluntarily focus on various information sources, and then we decide what is and is not relevant in achieving our long-term goals. Moreover, our decisions continually change according to changes in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on macaque monkeys have shown that a large part of the brain is involved in collecting information in the initial steps of decision-making. After a certain time period, when enough information is processed, the cells reach a threshold where a decision has to be made. It is at this point, it seems, that all cells start to shift in favor of one single criterion and the decision is made. It appears that when the task is complex and there are too many choices, crowdsourcing works best. Lots of information is analyzed before all of the neurons come to a single decision, and this decision is communicated to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to say that quick decision-making cannot be done with crowdsourcing. In fact, many decisions would likely make use of more distant parts of the brain and multiple neurons. We are often faced with decisions that are complex yet have to be taken quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/27/thinking-slow-about-thinking-fast-part-iv-the-framing-effect/&quot;&gt;Quick decisions&lt;/a&gt; have their own benefits and risks. There are higher chances of error, yet, in many cases, making a decision quickly is imperative. It is quite possible that the brain has some kind of mechanism to minimize this rate of error for quick and decentralized decision-making. The process of crowdsourcing and decentralized decision-making has been studied in detail in colonies of ants, where many decisions are taken by the crowd, though it often comes at the cost of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether decision-making is prompt or delayed, a factor that seems to be of great influence is the expected reward or outcome. It is quite possible that certain areas of the brain may be dedicated to it. Thus playing the role of influencers, be it the decision of some small group of neurons or crowdsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever way the decision-making is done, what seems to be evident from animal studies is that it has two phases. The first phase is information gathering, and the second phase consists of coming to a consensus and making the final decision. To a degree that depends on the situation, this final step may be influenced by more important neurons. Unsurprising considering the complexity of the mechanisms involved, the ‘details’ of this process are cloudy at best.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, Molecular and Cellular Biology retracted a 2003 paper by Susana Gonzalez. Last February, the National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Spain dismissed her from her position over allegations of misconduct. The reason: suspicions […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what a woman is really thinking, ask another woman. That’s the message of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01324/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_352999_69_Psycho_20170808_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; which was designed to probe our ability to use other people’s posture, facial expressions and behaviours, as well our interpretations of ambiguous statements, to infer what’s going on in their mind – no matter what they’re actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Renata Wacker at the Free University of Berlin, Germany, recruited 304 women and 241 men, ranging in age from 17 to 70. The volunteers were put through possibly the most irritating – though potentially clinically useful – movie-watching experience imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29973&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition is a 15-minute fictional film that focuses on the social interactions between two female and two male middle-aged adults preparing for and getting together for dinner. The film pauses no fewer than forty-five times for the viewer to answer questions about the characters’ thoughts, intentions and emotions. (For example, “What is Cliff thinking?”, “Why is Betty saying this?”, and “What is Michael feeling?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each question has four multiple choice answers, three of which are wrong – for instance, in one pre-dinner scene, Cliff and Sandra are enjoying chatting about Cliff’s recent holiday in Sweden, then Michael arrives and dominates the conversation, directing all his speech at Sandra. Slightly annoyed, Sandra looks at Cliff then asks Michael if he’s been to Sweden. Participants are asked why she did this: the correct answer is to help get Cliff back into the conversation; an example of an incorrect answer is to loosen Michael up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work has found that this test can pick up mind-reading deficits in autism, borderline personality disorder and body dysmorphic disorders, and can measure individual differences in mind-reading ability in typical adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers found that overall the female volunteers got significantly better scores than the men. This didn’t come as a huge surprise, as other work has found that, on average, women are better at inferring other people’s mental states and identifying facial expressions. But the analysis also revealed that women were better at mind-reading other women than they were at reading men. Men were also slightly better at reading women than men, but they still scored lower than the female participants (note that, unlike women, men didn’t show an own-sex mind-reading advantage – they weren’t any better at reading men than women were).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation for women being easier to read could be that they are more emotionally expressive than men, as suggested by some past research, although a recent study found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/18/do-women-really-show-their-emotions-more-than-men/&quot;&gt;the true gender pattern is more complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the superior performance of the female volunteers, this may be because women are simply better at mind-reading. Alternatively, they may be more motivated to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287568&quot;&gt;Differences in male and female friendships&lt;/a&gt; may be one factor that contributes to greater mind-reading skills in women, the researchers suggested. Research has found that women are more likely to share emotions with, and simply to talk more with, their female friends than men do with their male friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the women’s particular skill at reading other women’s thoughts, “the proposed social-cognitive mechanism and developmental factors of this bias have to be examined in following studies,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also re-analysed their data, this time with a focus on the volunteers’ ages. They found that young adults were better mind-readers, overall. Performance started to decrease around the age of 30, and continued to get worse through middle and old age. It’s possible this is partly because of known age-related declines in cognitive performance, but again, this is something that will have to be explored in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&quot;The readability of scientific texts is decreasing over time&quot;, according to a new paper just out. Swedish researchers Pontus Plaven-Sigray and colleagues say that scientists today use longer and more complex words than those of the past, making their writing harder to read.

	<title>Brain Blogger: Environmental Factors in Development of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22832</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is one of those conditions where genetics is known to play a profound role but is not the sole factor in disease development and progression. The evidence is mounting that the environment has a great deal to do with the development of this neurodegenerative disorder. Moreover, it is now known that the right kind of nutrition and lifestyle may play preventive role in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain environmental factors, like exposure to toxic chemicals and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, have long been known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s, dementia, and Parkinsonism. However, the intricacies of this interaction between the environment and genetics is poorly understood. What we know for sure is that the environment does play an important role in the diseases’ development and that certain genes can be predisposing factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a gene called APOE4 is considered to be one of the major risk factors in developing familial &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, studies have shown the much lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s in sub-Saharan Africans as compared to Africans living in Western societies, where pollution, industrial food, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle render people more susceptible to the disease. There have been very few studies comparing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s among genetically similar populations living in completely different environments. One such study compared the residents of a small Nigerian town with African Americans and found the incidence of Alzheimer’s much higher among those living in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at the factors that have been strongly linked with neurodegeneration, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to and poisoning with &lt;strong&gt;heavy metals and pesticides&lt;/strong&gt; has been well studied and documented. However, neurodegeneration occurs due to chronic low-level exposure to these toxic elements. The long term accumulative&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/06/how-prenatal-lead-exposure-results-in-neurodevelopmental-disorders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exposure to lead&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to cause a decrease in memory and progressive decline in mental functions.  In contrast to lead, the role of aluminium has long been overlooked. This metal is present in many medications (like antacid suspensions). Aluminium is an additive in various commercially available food products, food colorants, and is even used to purify water. There is increasing evidence that it may be playing a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pollution&lt;/strong&gt; is something to that many of us are exposed to from a very young age, and in most cases, we do not have much choice. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/19/fighting-mental-and-physical-illness-by-reshaping-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polluted air&lt;/a&gt; in large cities contains a toxic cocktail of organic and non-organic compounds, metals, and gases. Evidence of a link between neurodegeneration and air pollution is growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in developing nations, non-infectious diseases are the main health threat in Western societies, and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unhealthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; is the main causative factor in the development of serious chronic conditions. Some estimates suggest that &lt;strong&gt;obesity and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt; are now killing more people than any other disease. Research data show that the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease increases by as much as 6-fold in obese people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; decreases the risk of almost any disease, thus having a direct and indirect effect on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/07/can-diet-accelerate-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;development of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; as well. Apart from physical exercise, it is also important to stay mentally active. Older people who continue to participate in &lt;strong&gt;mental activities&lt;/strong&gt;, such as learning new things, reading, or even listening to music have a lower chance of declines in brain function. Social participation may also help to stay mentally active. Many people tend to become isolated as they grow old. However, maintaining a high level of social activity not only decreases stress and improves mood but may also prevent or delays Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological stress&lt;/strong&gt; results in an increased level of stress hormones that have been shown to be damaging for brain functionality. Emotional distress like depression and anxiety in young people and middle-aged adults is thought to increase the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s later in life. Some researchers think that emotional distress could be considered an early symptom of neurodegeneration. There is now a wide consensus that emotional distress is a risk factor for dementia and mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps the single most important factor that can either prevent or aggregate mental decline. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is a preventive factor, due to the high content of vitamins, microelements, and antioxidants. Diets with a high saturated fat and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; content are harmful, as these fats block blood vessels and are the reason for stroke and cardiac diseases. As the brain is mostly made of fats, it is important to have a balanced diet. Omega-3 has been shown to be neuroprotective, and products like fish oil, soya oil, and walnuts, are a rich source of this compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The familial genetic history of neurodegenerative diseases does not necessarily mean that a person will develop mental decline. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/24/surprising-role-of-prions-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; are still highly preventable. By avoiding triggers in the environment and living a healthy, active life, one may expect to remain mentally alert until ripe old age.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Oscillatory Thoughts: The neuroscience tenure-track</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5648062351012720545.post-399016317385940518</guid>
	<link>http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/the-neuroscience-tenure-track.html</link>
	<description>The point of this post is to tell my story and explain, as best I can and in as much detail as possible, my path toward &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/hello-san-diego.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accepting a tenure-track position at UCSD&lt;/a&gt;. I will attempt to give as many factual and quantitative details as possible (where appropriate) for people who might be looking to &quot;compare&quot; in their own job hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brief aside: I'm going to shy away from discussing issues of gender, sex, nationality, class, parenthood, and race because--while I know those factors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/the-academic-gender-bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/race-discrimination-in-academia-has-not-improved-over-past-20-years/2003102.article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/05/23/nokids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; in academia--they're too complex for me to be able to adequately address. However I would like to happily note that the chair of my new home department of Cognitive Science, the chair of the search committee, and the two other computational faculty are all women from a diversity of backgrounds. For those who are curious, I myself am of mixed race from a working class family, but that is as much as I will say on the matter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that the academic path is variable and uncertain. When I was on the job hunt I remember looking at other peoples' CVs to see how mine stacked up. I looked at where other post-docs (my competition) published their papers. I looked at their &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-indices and grants and conference proceedings. I remember thinking, &quot;what do I have that could possibly make me stand out compared to these amazing scientists&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We encounter this uncertainty repeatedly in academia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will I pass my qualifying exams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I come up with a novel hypothesis and run an experiment, from start to finish, to test it properly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I know enough to do so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I successfully defend my thesis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a post-doc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run experiments over and over again?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delegate work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a grant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a tenure-track job?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run a lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/04/why-i-chose-academia.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do I even want to keep doing this or just go and make real money?&lt;/a&gt; Academia isn't the only job for us. If you don't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want it, you should seriously ask yourself why you're pursuing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've struggled at every step along the way. There's been doubt, for sure, but I've talked about all these things in detail on here already and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2011/08/career-advice.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to give advice where possible&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/02/anti-items-in-cvs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trying to do my part to mitigate the doubt of future scientists&lt;/a&gt; (and this post is yet another attempt at that) while being as honest as possible. That's important to me because I feel like there's a lack of clarity in the academic job process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's get to the details (skip to the &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; end if you just want to compare numbers and CVs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried applying for faculty jobs in Oct/Nov 2010. I applied to psychology jobs at both Stanford and UCLA. This was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; early; I'd just finished my PhD but three of my thesis projects were published that that year, one each in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-neuron-paper-dynamic.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/10/voytek-pnas-paper-prefrontal-cortex-and.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-frontiers-in-human-neuroscience.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, each cited (by now) at least 30 times (so they had a decent scientific impact). It was a big year so I thought I'd &quot;dip my toe in the water&quot; and strike while the iron was hot, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that no one--no friends, faculty who wrote my letters of recommendation, etc.--actually thought I'd get a job, but I wanted the practice in applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ah, the academic life before parenthood... I finished writing my job applications on a ferry leaving Kobe, Japan after giving an invited presentation at the International Congress of Clinical Neurophysiology, which was an &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; trip for my wife and I.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to this round of applications I got nothing back but form letter rejections around Feb/Mar the following year. But I honestly didn't mind because I had a good post-doc job and I wasn't expecting anything anyway. I really wasn't emotionally invested (by intent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pause here: I want to note that the applications I sent weren't great. The research statements were weak and I didn't do a good job explicitly stating my overall research theme and goals. This is a skill at which I often fail but one the importance of which I cannot emphasize enough:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You know your work better than anyone which makes it easy to forget to be explicit and connect all the dots, but &lt;b&gt;you need to connect those dots and frame your work clearly within the bigger picture&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The committee reading your application won't know your subfield like you do. If you apply to a department that has a broad mission like Cognitive Science--which ranges from computer science to anthropology--you need to make sure you explain your work in a way that everyone can understand and appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the 2011 application deadline came around I didn't bother applying for any jobs because I'd just had my first child a few months beforehand. Furthermore I'd just started my current post-doc and I was really excited to get those projects going. I wasn't in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 2012 applications (again, Nov/Dec) I decided to make a second tentative attempt. My post-doc grant still had a few more years of funding, but several jobs opened that just &quot;felt right&quot;. Stanford had a vision science position that sounded like a good fit, UCLA had an opening in psychology, and UCSD had a position in the Department of Cognitive Science for a computational cognitive scientist doing work in data-mining, BCI, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Can you tell I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wanted to stay in California?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainscanr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainSCANr&lt;/a&gt; paper was just published and some of the work I had currently under review were data-mining projects, UCSD seemed like an excellent, rare fit. Again, it was a bit early because none of my post-doc work was published and, again, I wasn't emotionally committed (meaning I was steeled against failure), but I'd have kicked myself if I didn't try. The cost of entry is very low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My applications were much stronger this time. While my CV wasn't phenomenally better, by this point I'd begun running my own mini-lab inside my post-doc lab and I had two &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; strong papers under review at &quot;good journals&quot; (bleeeeech I hate saying that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late January I heard that I wasn't short-listed for the UCLA job. Apparently I was &quot;strongly considered&quot;, and much-discussed, but in the end they wanted a behavioral neuroscientist (not a cognitive/computational person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As opposed to the first time I tried applying, this time I got personal letters back from faculty on both the UCLA and Stanford committees (&quot;I decided to write you to thank you personally for your application... I am a real fan of the work you are doing...&quot;) Honestly I wasn't even upset; those folks seriously know how to make someone feel good about being rejected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was sitting at home with my wife the night I got the rejection from UCLA, I received an email from UCSD while I was nursing my wounds (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, watching &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; or whatever). They asked me if I was still interested in the position to which I had applied.  I re-read that email several times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding. I had my wife read it, too, to verify. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. So I set up a phone meeting with the UCSD cognitive science search committee chair and we arranged a date for me to fly down for my job talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were six weeks between that phone call and my interview. Now, I've given a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of scientific talks, both for large audiences and small, for lay-people and specialists. When I gave my first practice talk at my lab's meeting a few weeks before my job talk, it was &lt;i&gt;okay&lt;/i&gt;, but far from great. I made four mistakes that you should avoid:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did a poor job explaining the narrative flow linking one experiment to the next.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to fit in too much (the &quot;everything plus the kitchen sink&quot; approach). I'm excited about research--my research in particular (hence why I want to stay in academia)--but you have to know which parts to cut. Less really is more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't leave people with a strong feeling of the overarching theme of my work...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nor did I adequately leave them with a sense of excitement about the future of my work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are hard problems to tackle! But the solution to several of them is essentially: &lt;i&gt;be explicit&lt;/i&gt;. The narrative flow is an easy problem to address, because it essentially recapitulates &lt;i&gt;what really happened during the course of your research career&lt;/i&gt;. Meaning papers &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; are extensions based off papers &lt;i&gt;n-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n-2&lt;/i&gt;, ...&lt;i&gt;n-i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So &lt;b&gt;talk about them that way&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I practiced my talk in front of other people two more times: once with my PhD lab and once for my wife and a friend. I did a final practice run on my own, speaking slowly to make sure I wouldn't go over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make sure you do not go over time&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone hates that. Don't make everyone hate you because of a dumb issue like amateur time mismanagement. Everyone's time is valuable; don't hold your audience hostage. It's rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My visit to San Diego was not without some frustrations. My visit was scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, with my talk being Wednesday at noon. The visit was to begin with an 8am breakfast, followed by meetings with the search committee chair and departmental chair, and then my talk. After the talk there were more meetings, dinner with some faculty, and then another full day of one-on-one meetings with faculty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unwisely (in hindsight) I decided to fly down late the night before my talk so that I could help my wife with getting our son from daycare, fed, bathed, etc. My flight was scheduled to arrive in San Diego at 10:40pm. I assumed I'd grab a taxi to my hotel near UCSD's campus and be in bed by midnight. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as we were landing the pilot suddenly kicked the engines into high gear (or whatever the aeronautical equivalent term is) and began to ascend. After circling San Diego's airport for about 30-40 minutes we were informed that, because of dense fog, we were being diverted to Los Angeles. We finally landed at LAX at around 11:30pm, after which time we were to wait around for busses that would then drive us to the San Diego airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was all carry-on so I was ready to go as soon as we landed. But I did the quick math and, by the time all the other passengers got their luggage, the mob figured out what to do, boarded the busses, and finally got on the road, it would be about 1am. Add a 2-hour drive to the San Diego airport, and then another 30-40 minutes &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; north to UCSD... that would get me into my hotel room at around 3-4am. I opted out of that arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling a few friends in LA to see if I could catch a late-night ride to San Diego (and offer up my hotel room to my generous driver for a night) I was reminded that the following morning (the morning of my job talk) was my good friend's memorial service. A close friend of ours had recently, unexpectedly, died, so &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of my closest friends in LA were attending his services (which I had to miss for the job talk... ugh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/10/17/neuroscientist-bradley-voytek-is-bringing-the-silicon-valley-ethos-into-academia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work for a car company&lt;/a&gt; so I requested an Uber to come pick me up. I explained to the the poor guy that came to get me that this wasn't a quick 20 minute ride (long drive, late night, job interview, etc.) I told him I didn't expect him to do such a long trip so late at night in the middle of the week. Amazingly the guy agreed to drive me anyway and was a &lt;i&gt;god damn champ&lt;/i&gt;. As I apologized for the bumper-to-bumper 1am Thursday LA traffic he just kept saying, &quot;my job is to get you to your job interview well-rested, so don't worry.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I got checked into my hotel it was about 2:00am. I figured I'd get up at 7:30, quick shower and shave, throw on my suit, and meet for breakfast in the lobby at 8am. But whomever stayed in the hotel room before me had different plans, so &lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;surprise&lt;/i&gt;! when the alarm in my room went off at 6:15am (I was using my phone's alarm plus a wake up call to wake me up... I hadn't checked the room's alarm clock). Once I figured out how to turn the damn thing off I was &lt;i&gt;awake&lt;/i&gt;. Too excited from the cortisol/adrenaline rush to go back to sleep now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took my time, got ready, had some coffee, checked my email, and went for a walk around the hotel (which was beautiful, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s1600/IMG_1202.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s400/IMG_1202.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s1600/IMG_1204.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s400/IMG_1204.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s1600/IMG_1201.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s400/IMG_1201.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Needless to say I had no problem getting to my 8am breakfast on time. But I was looking at a non-stop 13-hour day of interviews, job talk, meetings, and socializing on about 3-3.5 hours of sleep (and knowing all of my closest friends were grieving for another very close friend).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;When I first did that simple math I suddenly became very thankful for the last 18 months of parenthood for teaching me how to cope with sleep deprivation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Surprisingly I was so thrilled to be there that I don't really remember feeling overly tired. Thankfully the department had a lot of water (and a nice welcome bag with UCSD CogSci schwag) waiting for me, so I just kept hydrated and kept talking!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n9DVpsrAXp0/UW4fou6xXNI/AAAAAAAAFSQ/XiN9qi3T_O8/s1600/IMG_1206.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n9DVpsrAXp0/UW4fou6xXNI/AAAAAAAAFSQ/XiN9qi3T_O8/s400/IMG_1206.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're curious, here are the slides from my talk (not including all the extras I tack onto the end in case I get follow-up, clarification, or methodological questions... remember to always be a step or two ahead!) You'll note that I'm very text-light in my talks. I know my slides well so I use the figures and images on the pages to prompt me (no written or digital notes). I'm also a one-figure-per-page speaker when I can get away with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to hear me give a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; rough version of this talk, here's a video from a talk I did at Berkeley City College about 6 months beforehand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of comparison for you bean counters, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/voytek_cv_tt.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my CV&lt;/a&gt;, frozen at the time I got the job offer from UCSD. My &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-index was 8. I didn't have any &lt;i&gt;Nature &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; papers (but I did have a &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt; paper) nor any fancy grants (no K99, NRSA, etc.)  My most highly-cited primary research paper was an open-access paper published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;. I also had a few methods papers, including the more... non-standard... &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainscanr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainSCANr&lt;/a&gt; paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unusual thing I included was my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/10/crowdsourcing-letter-of-recommendation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;crowdsourced letter of recommendation&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which definitely seemed to have gotten peoples' attention.  My extracurricular activities (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com/lessons/diagnosing-a-zombie-brain-and-behavior-tim-verstynen-bradley-voytek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;zombie neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, blogging, outreach, etc.) weren't even really mentioned (in the positive or negative) so I'm not sure what the committee thought of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps give some idea of what this process is like.  Remember that there really &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a lot of luck involved. The departments need to be looking for someone who fills a niche they're lacking. While you can't control your academic fate because of this &quot;luck&quot; factor, you can do a few things to tip the balance in your favor: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Obviously) do good science in a field you love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network and get your name out there: speak at conferences, run symposia, reach out to faculty at universities when you're traveling to see if you can give a department colloquium or lab meeting. But I think &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; travel is becoming less important as social media and email grow ever more pervasive (invasive?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure other people know about your research (send PDFs of your papers to colleagues who've inspired your research).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your shit together and remember that this is a &lt;i&gt;job&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

	<title>BMC Series blog: Behind the Image: a bug’s life</title>

	<link>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/15/behind-image-bugs-life/</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9426 size-full&quot; height=&quot;5042&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3362&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Masters in behavioral ecology, biodiversity, and evolution and have been a research engineer since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was trained in entomology, but in my job I mostly work on Neotropical mammals in French Guiana. I work from the field sessions to the laboratory, capturing and sampling of animals, and then molecular biology, population genetics, and taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area of research is interesting for me because I am very involved in ecological and conservation issues, which are a priority. Moreover, the alternation of the field and the laboratory, as well as a few projects beside, means that there is no routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started ten years ago. Passionate about insects, it was already a good way to explore this macro-universe and to discover details and fabulous texture. it is also a way to raise public awareness to the ecological cause, and highlight the gorgeousness of insects so unloved. Finally, it is a good excuse to be in nature…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken in a rainforest in French Guiana with a Canon 7D and a 100mm f/2.8 macro. I never use a flash, even in the dark forest I prefer keeping my ability to move, using natural light and increasing ISO if necessary. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com&quot;&gt;http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was involved in a capture field session of little mammals (rodents and marsupials) in the context of wildlife inventories. I always look to see if there are any interesting pictures to take, and this day, it was an ant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see an Ant of genus &lt;em&gt;Ectatomma&lt;/em&gt; who is wide-awake and standing on a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior is always interesting to observe because it shows the close mutualist relationship that exists between ants and myrmecophile plants: here, the host plant secretes nectar via specialized structures called domaties to feed ants and in exchange these ants protect the plant from predators. That is why, when the ant feels threatened, it takes a defensive position.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Retraction watch: Chem journal cautions readers about data in three papers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A chemistry journal has issued expressions of concern for three papers after a reader notified the editors of “unexplained discrepancies” in the data. According to the notices, after the editors of Organic &amp;amp; Biomolecular Chemistry confirmed the problems, they contacted the corresponding author on the three papers, Pradeep Kumar—who works at the Council of Scientific and Industrial […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth authored a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-07951-009&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on a trait she called “grit” which went on to arrest the attention of anyone interested in the secrets of success. TED talks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/&quot;&gt;a 2016 book&lt;/a&gt; followed, wherein Duckworth explained how a combination of passion for a topic, and perseverance in the face of difficulties – the two facets of grit – were the recipe for achievement, a claim borne out by studies &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550610385872&quot;&gt;within schools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2015-56733-003&quot;&gt;across the lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, researchers have become more critical of the scope and relevance of the concept. Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31799-001&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts&lt;/i&gt;, suggests grit gives surprisingly little insight into the world of creative success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29880&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first glance, grit seems a must for creatives. Countless artistic professionals associate their success with a passion for their chosen art form, and describe the necessity of perseverance in the face of obstacles and discouragement. But the value of grit isn’t backed by the three new studies from a team led by Magdalena Grohman at the University of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used Duckworth’s publicly available “&lt;a href=&quot;https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/&quot;&gt;grit scale&lt;/a&gt;” (which taps passion and perseverance); a personality questionnaire measuring the Big Five traits; and a self-report measure of creativity, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, which captures public achievement in ten different creative domains such as music or dance, with participants scoring higher if they’ve done things like played in a band or made an original composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an initial survey of 131 university students (two thirds women, average age 19), their creative achievement scores correlated with their scores on the personality measure of Openness to Experience, but showed no significant relationship with either facet of grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second larger study (325 students), with more comprehensive measures of grit and personality, found Openness again correlated with creativity, both on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire and on a measure of everyday creativity capturing frequency of activities such as writing or being a member of a camera club. But again, grit showed no correlation with either creative measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems surprising, but consider something: the first survey found the “passion” facet of grit (among other things, high scorers say that are not distracted by new ideas and projects) correlated &lt;i&gt;negatively &lt;/i&gt;with scores on Openness to Experience. Given that higher Openness is associated strongly with greater creativity, both here and in the wider literature, the negative correlation with grit should give us pause for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grohman’s team were ahead of us, highlighting that Duckworth defines passion primarily as a commitment to one thing at the expense of others (another example: on the grit scale, passionate people score lower on the item “I become interested in new pursuits every few months”). Openness, as the name suggests, is &lt;i&gt;all about&lt;/i&gt; becoming interested in new and different things. Moreover, there is no emotional element in the passion facet of grit as conceptualised by Duckworth: no measure of excitement, joy or elation by participating in the activity. Her notion of passion is less like the fiery, explorative artist, and more like a nerdy completionist devoting their time to finding that last sticker for their 1986 Panini sticker book. And that characterisation simply seems to miss the mark of what we mean by creative passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds unfair, consider Grohman and her colleague’s final study, where they asked high school students to rate classmates’ creativity, in terms of who produced the most original assignments. Their teachers were also asked to rate the students’ persistence and passion, in whatever way they understood those terms, and both these scores correlated with higher student creativity. The students’ self-reported perseverance (as measured by Duckworth’s grit questionnaire) also correlated weakly with their creativity, but this association disappeared once the researchers took account of differences in personality scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that teacher-rated passion and teacher-rated persistence correlated with creativity (even after accounting for personality), but that scores on the grit scale did not, suggests that passion is indeed relevant to creativity, but not as conceptualised by Duckworth’s notion of grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that these were student samples rather than professional creatives, so further work would need to be done there too, but given the conceptual tension between passion and Openness, it seems plausible to expect similar patterns to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave grit? Well, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845531&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that grit has only modest associations with performance, and is strongly associated with the incumbent personality predictor of success, trait Conscientiousness (also true in this study, with correlations between .54 and.65), it seems appropriate to dial down the grit hype and treat this construct like any other psychological measure – of potential interest, but unlikely to be the breakthrough that changes society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31799-001&quot;&gt;The Role of Passion and Persistence in Creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>UH Biocomputation group: Compartmental modelling of neurons and the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2017-09-14:/2017/09/14/compartmental-modelling-of-neurons-and-the-hodgkin-huxley-formalism.html</guid>
	<link>http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2017/09/14/compartmental-modelling-of-neurons-and-the-hodgkin-huxley-formalism.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volker Steuber will give a basic introduction to compartmental modelling of neurons and discuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model, published in the paper &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413&quot;&gt;A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952)'&lt;/a&gt;.
Abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational models of neurons vary in their biological realism and level of detail, ranging from point neurons such as simple and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire and Izhikevich models to morphologically realistic conductance based multi-compartmental models. Multi-compartmental models often include representations of voltage and ligand gated ion channels; these can be modelled using (commonly) the Hodgkin-Huxley or (sometimes) the Markov formalism. In this talk, I will give a basic introduction to compartmental modelling of neurons and discuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is one of the foundations of computational neuroscience, having been published in a series of seminal articles in 1952 and leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Byte - The HBP blog: Roof luggage, raindrops and a theory of memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/2c617560996e</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/roof-luggage-raindrops-and-a-theory-of-memory-2c617560996e?source=rss----8bf7660fc7aa---4</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HBP web editor Greg Meylan talked to theoretical neuroscientist Dr Misha Tsodyks about his first principles approach to understanding memory recall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after I spoke to Misha Tsodyks I was standing at a pedestrian crossing in the bright Geneva sunlight waiting for the lights to change. My mind was idling, memory circuits ready to fire at the smallest provocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5IhOX8qxItFW2F-MSmeLxQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Remember, this may not be the most aerodynamic way to attach a car roof-box. Photo courtesy dave_7/Flickr.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A car with a roof-box turned in front of me. As my eyes followed its movement, the shape of the roof-box ran down my neural pathways and hit upon a memory: of my friend’s father, an idiosyncratic hydrologist with a fine knowledge of fluid dynamics. He always attached his roof box the other way round to everyone else — with the flat end facing forward and the slope at the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More like the shape of a falling raindrop, I thought. Then I remembered that the classic raindrop shape is not a true depiction (see below). I’d read somewhere what shape raindrops actually take on their descent to earth, but I couldn’t recall exactly what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From car roof-box to raindrop. This was my memory firing, flitting from one thing to the next, sparked by the random passing of a car. Which was pretty much how Tsodyks had described his theories of memory recall to me the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his collaborators Mikhail Katkov and Sandro Romani, Tsodyks recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2817%2930292-1&quot;&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; that sought to demonstrate a first principles approach to understanding memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper provides a framework for how memories are triggered sequentially. When one set of neurons in a memory network is activated, it triggers the retrieval of the next item. The stronger the connections between two given memory networks, the more likely one will trigger the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory is based on two principles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. An encoding principle, which states that an item is encoded in the brain by a specific group of neurons in a dedicated memory network. When it is recalled, this specific group of neurons is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The associativity principle, which states that in the absence of sensory cues, a retrieved item plays the role of an internal cue that triggers the retrieval of the next item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/506/1*lHOcqaSETEGBTsG-uu4RJw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Three Steps of Retrieval Process. Each memory item in a list of four is represented by a randomly chosen population of neurons, here illustrated by blue circles. The size of the circle reflects the number of neurons representing a given item; the size of the overlap between the circles (darker area) reflects the number of neurons representing two given items.

Image and caption courtesy Misha Tsodyks/&lt;em&gt;Neuron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Neuron &lt;/em&gt;paper describes the process in what Tsodyks says is fairly simple mathematics. The value of this description is that it can produce predictable, testable results, something which is fairly rare in this area of neuroscience, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The surprising thing is that by applying it in an analytical framework, you get really clear predictions. If you are trying to remember something that has no structure, e.g. a list of words, or the movies you have watched, and if you apply this idea of sequential triggering, then you can predict how many things you are going to remember out of a list of a certain size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tested against &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_recall&quot;&gt;classic free recall&lt;/a&gt; experiments Tsodyks’ formula produced results close to those observed. Further experiments are planned, and Tsodyks is hopeful that the theory will hold. One of the surprising predictions of the model was that each word participants were exposed to in the free recall experiment had an intrinsic recall probability. Furthermore, the retrieval of easy words leads to a reduction of the overall number of retrieved words, due to the circuits following strong connections around in a circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because memory is so important to how the brain functions, Tsodyks believes theories of its processes will help in other areas. Indeed, he sees no fundamental difference between memory, thought or talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think thinking and talking are memory recall. The way I think about it is that thinking and talking are actually the same process. Because the way I think it works is that every thought you have is the signal for the next, every idea is linked to another one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Neuroscience, there is nothing you can really predict. We do not know how things really work, and the brain is so complex. Both these things mean you cannot make quantitative predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical world is the same, he says; for example, you cannot predict temperature of the sun. But you can simplify it, and with basic rules you can predict things like how long it takes a ball to fall. His paper on first principles seeks to provide a similar framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; paper says: “Despite thousands of years of astronomical observations, a clear picture unifying the motion of celestial objects appeared only after the formulation of a very few basic principles, known as Newton’s laws.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory should be able accommodate more biologically realistic mechanisms and representations, says Tsodyks, with the possibility of still deeper explanatory powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ve looked up what a rain drop looks like. It looks a bit like a hamburger bun, flat on the bottom and curved on top. This description is now entangled in a memory circuit that should forever overlap with roof boxes, my friend’s father, and a theory on memory itself. If the theory holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Misha Tsodyks works at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. He is part of the HBP’s neuroscience team, whose theories help inform the work of other areas of the HBP such as brain simulation, neuromorphic computing and neurorobotics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=2c617560996e&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/roof-luggage-raindrops-and-a-theory-of-memory-2c617560996e&quot;&gt;Roof luggage, raindrops and a theory of memory&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog&quot;&gt;Brain Byte Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf&quot;&gt;Extreme Male Brain theory of autism&lt;/a&gt;, there are certain cognitive and behavioural characteristics that manifest more often in men than women, on average, such as a bias for systematic rather than empathic thinking. Autism can be seen as as extreme version of that typical male profile, the theory proposes, possibly caused by prenatal &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/01/21/fetal-exposure-to-testosterone-linked-with-presence-of-autistic-traits-in-childhood/&quot;&gt;exposure to higher than usual amounts of testosterone in the womb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related observation is that exposure to high concentrations of prenatal testosterone leads to the development of “hyper masculine” facial features. It follows that if the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism is accurate, then autistic people will have hypermasculine faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09939-y&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; put this logic to the test, and consistent with the Extreme Male Brain theory, found that autistic girls and boys had more masculine faces as compared with neurotypical control children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29894&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research into whether autistic people tend to have stereotypically masculine facial features has been mixed. Women with sub-clinical autistic traits or a diagnosis of autism have been found to have more masculine than average faces, but studies with autistic men have sometimes found no difference from controls, or they’ve found the autistic men to have androgynous rather than hyper masculine features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new paper, the research team led by Diana Tan at the University of Western Australia, deliberately sought to test pre-pubescent autistic and neurotypical children, thus removing the possibility that hormonal changes during puberty might conceal or reverse any facial signs of prenatal exposure to high testosterone levels (as may have been the case in the earlier research involving adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan and her colleagues also employed a new 3D facial mapping process, tested on 48 neurotypical boys and 53 neurotypical girls, to provide a highly accurate and objective measure of the facial features that most typify a male and female child’s face. Using these features, the researchers’ algorithm was able to correctly categorise the sex of children’s faces with around 98 per cent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers deployed their 3D facial mapping algorithm to score the facial features of 54 caucasian autistic boys, 20 caucasian autistic girls and age-matched neurotypical caucasian boys and girls. This showed that the autistic boys and girls had more masculine than usual faces – to use the researchers’ jargon, their faces were hypermasculinised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when the researchers compared the autistic children and control children’s faces on the six facial features (mostly related to the positioning of the nose and upper lip) that most strongly distinguished neurotypcial boys’ faces from girls’ faces, the autistic kids of both sexes were found to have a more masculine score than controls on five of these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, among the autistic boys and girls, the more masculinised their faces, the more social and communication difficulties they tended to have, as scored in their diagnostic test for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample sizes for this study were relatively small, but the study’s biggest weakness is that it asks us to make a logical leap – high prenatal testosterone levels are known to cause faces to appear more masculine, autistic children have more masculine than average faces (as shown by the new results), &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; high prenatal testosterone levels contribute to autism (in line with the Extreme Male Brain Theory). However, as the researchers’ themselves acknowledge, this study featured no data on the testosterone levels that the children were exposed to prenatally, meaning there could be other explanations for the results. “Further investigation that tracks longitudinal links between early testosterone exposure, postnatal facial morphology and autism phenotype will provide more direct tests of the hypothesised relationships,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Extreme Male Brain theory has inspired important research into the causes of autism, but it has also been controversial. Cordelia Fine, the author of &lt;em&gt;Delusions of Gender&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Testosterone Rex&lt;/em&gt;, cites the theory as an example of contemporary “neurosexism”. And other recent research has uncovered findings that are inconsistent with the theory – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/1002/2224225/Sex-differences-in-autism-a-resting-state-fMRI&quot;&gt;last year a brain imaging study found that&lt;/a&gt;, compared with male neurotypical controls, autistic boys and men had resting connectivity patterns that resembled what’s more typically seen in women, while autistic girls and women showed a more masculine neurological profile, lending support “to the notion that autistic spectrum disorder may constitute a disorder of sexual differentiation or androgeny rather than a disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09939-y&quot;&gt;Hypermasculinised facial morphology in boys and girls with Autism Spectrum Disorder and its association with symptomatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/Sydney_skyline_from_the_north_aerial_2010-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of cancer, people are not all equal. An individual’s likelihood of survival following a cancer diagnosis depends on many factors. These include tumor characteristics, such as site, size and spread; demographic factors such as age; but also where people are born and live along with the conditions of daily life – the so called social determinants of health. This broader environment impacts on how healthy our lives are, how early cancer is detected and what kind of treatment we receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined comparative cancer survival in New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, over a 30-year period and identified higher risk of cancer death for those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas and outside major cities. These survival disparities remained when we took into account differences in age, cancer stage at diagnosis, potential other causes of deaths, and differences in cancer site between population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disparities in cancer survival may be explained by factors that we cannot easily measure when using data from cancer registries. Factors that our study could not take into consideration included comorbidities, health behaviors, social support, and clinical cancer care. These factors are likely to impact overall cancer survival and any survival differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment is an important factor to consider when assessing cancer survival differences. There is evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491311&quot;&gt;disadvantaged population groups may receive less optimal treatment&lt;/a&gt;. New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we could not determine how much survival differences found in our study were driven by varied access to and/or quality of treatment, a universal health care system is expected to diminish some differences in health status between population groups. Despite the universal health care system in Australia, people with lower socio-economic status had worse cancer outcomes in NSW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from our study are unlikely to be specific to NSW or Australia. In fact, the association between lower socio-economic status and lower cancer survival has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999326&quot;&gt;demonstrated in several countries&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20717112&quot;&gt;other countries which also have universal health coverage and extensive social safety nets&lt;/a&gt;. This further highlights that cancer survival disparities are not entirely explained, nor fixed, by health care system related factors; a broader socio-economic context appears to be exerting an influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NSW, the comparative risk of cancer death in people living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas has increased over time. Cancer survival has improved over time for everyone but it seems that improvements have been greater or happened more quickly for well-off people, and consequently the survival gap has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer survival in migrants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined cancer survival by migrant status and grouped people based on their country of birth into those from English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. Australia has a large migrant population with more than a quarter of the population born outside Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrant groups may be disadvantaged in terms of health outcomes due to cultural, linguistic and health literacy barriers. However, according to our results, people born in other English-speaking countries had a similar risk, and those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our results … those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps surprising especially if we assume that language skills are associated with capacity to navigate through the health system, and that these navigation skills translate into better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that better survival in people born in non-English speaking countries is partly artefactual. Migrants are commonly healthier than the general population (so called ‘healthy migrant’ effect). They may also return to their home countries for the final stages of their life, so that information about their deaths won’t be recorded in the country where they were diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703888&quot;&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that people born outside Australia had slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, loss to follow-up appears to be a plausible explanation for recorded cancer survival advantage for some migrant groups in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic disadvantage is a complex concept with no consensus on how best to measure it. Several factors, including education, income, employment and family background have differing and likely culture-dependent effects on a person’s socio-economic status. We measured socio-economic disadvantage using an area-based measure which may not correspond to individual’s social class or position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to develop targeted actions and interventions, a more in-depth understanding of reasons driving socio-economic differences in cancer survival is needed. Such factors are likely to lie outside the direct responsibility of the health sector. Therefore, properly resourced and co-ordinated input from service providers from different sectors is essential for closing the socio-economic cancer survival gap.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: The Mystery of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=22826</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/13/the-mystery-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Almost 150 years have passed since Jean-Martin Charcot first described &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/26/celiac-disease-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-is-there-a-link/&quot;&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, an ailment that leads to the destruction of motor neurons. Medical sciences have progressed tremendously in the last century, resulting in serious improvements in health care and our ability to manage even the most serious of conditions. However, this is not the case for ALS. The progress in understanding this disease has been slow. Even today, there is no clear diagnostic criteria, no single confirmatory diagnostic test, not to mention a cure. But that does not mean that nothing has changed. The first effective drug to slow down the progress of the disease was approved in the 1990s. This article will briefly review the progress that has been made towards combating this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our muscles are made in such a way that if the neurons that supply them fail, the muscles also start to degrade. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/11/20/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-is-an-early-diagnosis-possible/&quot;&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; is a disease characterized by progressive weakening of muscles due to the failure of neurons until the muscles are no longer able to support the body’s vital activities. For the majority of patients, the lifespan after disease onset is only two to five years, but there are long-term survivors too. The famous physicist Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with ASL in 1963 and has lived with the condition for over 40 years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide incidence of ALS is not known exactly, but in Europe 2.6 cases of disease per 100,000 people are diagnosed each year. The highest onset is in the age group of 58–63 years. Not all causes of the disease are understood, but familial (~10%) and genetic (~65%) factors are usually considered to be the main causes. Old age, male gender, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/11/epigenetics-and-its-major-influence-on-life/&quot;&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt; remain the only recognized risk factors. The risk for the disease also appears to be increased by a number of environmental and lifestyle factors. Below is the summary of all the risk factors known to date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Familial aggregation&lt;/em&gt; – persons with a family history of ALS are at increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genetics&lt;/em&gt; – several genes have been identified, although their role is not fully understood. The most common genes accepted to play a role in ALS include SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, OPTN, VCP, UBQLN2, C9ORF72, and PFN1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/em&gt; – the expanded GGGGCC repeat is associated with ALS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lifestyle risk factors&lt;/em&gt;: Most of them are preventable.&lt;em&gt;Smoking&lt;/em&gt; is known to be neurotoxic and increase the risk of ALS; &lt;em&gt;dietary factors&lt;/em&gt; such as antioxidants like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/03/16/vitamin-e-small-risk-big-consequences/&quot;&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt; may have a preventive role in ALS. Consequently, diet may have something to do with ALS; &lt;em&gt;low body weight&lt;/em&gt; may increase risk and worsen outcomes; &lt;em&gt;athleticism and chronic traumatic encephalopathy&lt;/em&gt; should not be misinterpreted, physical exercise decreases the risk of ALS, but the risk is higher among professional athletes who tend to be at higher risk of trauma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Occupations with high trauma rates&lt;/em&gt; – ALS prevalence has been shown to be higher in US &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/22/big-changes-for-diagnosing-ptsd/&quot;&gt;war veterans&lt;/a&gt; and people working with low magnetic fields like welders and electricians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pesticides &lt;/em&gt; – are widely used and have been suggested as a risk factor in various neurodegenerative disorders for some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some medical conditions &lt;/em&gt; – include head trauma, cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, certain viral infections, and neuroinflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of so many factors influencing the development of the disease underlines the complex nature of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation of ALS varies greatly from person to person, so does the survival rate. However, the vast majority (almost half) of patients do not live for more than 30 months after disease onset. Despite this, ~20% can survive for five to ten years, while others can expect to live even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little clarity when it comes to predicting the chance of survival for a person with ALS. However, the odds are better when the disease starts at a younger age. Also, life expectancy depends on where in the body the disease first started. The three major early stage presentations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limb-onset ALS with the involvement of both the upper and lower &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/11/motor-neurons-why-are-they-important-and-how-are-they-made/&quot;&gt;motor neurons&lt;/a&gt; (UMNs and LMNs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulbar-onset ALS that often starts with speech and swallowing difficulties, and with limb features developing later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less common is pure UMN involvement and muscular atrophy with LMN involvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulbar-onset ALS has the worst prognosis since the vital functioning of organs is affected at an early stage. This often leads to early respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also lots of controversy in the scientific literature when it comes to the question of where the disease begins. Some researchers believe that it starts in the brain and then migrates to the peripheral nerves and muscles (hence this theory is called “Dying-forward”). Other scientists believe that it all starts at the periphery at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/05/what-is-als-the-real-challenge/&quot;&gt;neuromuscular junction&lt;/a&gt; and later affects the neurons in the brain (hence this theory is called “Dying-backward”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of diagnostic tests in early disease, clinicians have to depend on clinical symptoms, identifying combinations of UMN and LMN signs. There is usually further delay with definite diagnostics, as the typical ALS symptoms can be part of many other rare &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/24/surprising-role-of-prions-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/&quot;&gt;neurodegenerative disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, an elaborate clinical and laboratory analysis is required for differential diagnosis, where tests involving brain imaging are often helpful for early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there is no complete understanding of why, where, and how the disease starts, finding treatment remains challenging. Further, the lack of proper early stage diagnostic techniques means that precious time is lost when the probability of effective treatment is at its highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there is only one drug, Riluzole, that has been shown to change the course of the disease, and it only helps for a few months. But this does not mean that there is no progress. Lots of promising research has been achieved in other animals, and there is need to translate this research to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, most of the treatment for ALS is symptomatic and supportive. They include physiotherapy, orthotics, and treatment of pain, dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), pain, constipation, loss of voice, and mental and emotional problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets burden minds. To understand how, researchers have previously focused on the act of concealment during one-off social interactions, showing that keeping a secret is draining and can increase anxiety. But what about the longer-term toll? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-20428-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Attitudes and Social Cognition &lt;/i&gt;describes ten studies on the impact of secrecy day-on-day, showing how the burden of a secret peppers our waking life with reminders and periods of brooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29878&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Columbia University team – Michael Slepian, Jinseok Chun, and Malia Mason – first developed and validated a secrets survey with two thousand participants. From this they identified 38 classes of secrets covering a range of contexts from theft and drug use to sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new survey with 600 more participants (for most of the paper, participants were recruited from an online portal and tended to be in their thirties), the researchers found that 96 per cent of them currently had a secret of some kind, most commonly romantic thoughts about someone outside their relationship, sexual behaviour, or emotional infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked participants to consider the past month and report how often they were in a situation where they had to conceal their secret, and how often their mind wandered to the secret when there was no need for concealment. Mind-wandering was twice as common as episodes involving concealment, and crucially, it was how often participants caught themselves thinking about the secret – but not how often they had to actively conceal it – that was associated with the impact of the secret on their lives, as measured by their ratings of how much “this secret made my life and well-being worse”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This apparently adverse effect of thinking about our secrets was replicated in a survey of tourists canvassed in New York. These findings suggest that active concealment – the primary focus of most secrecy research, and tightly wound into its scientific definition – may not be the defining characteristic of secrecy, and that it may rather be the repeated reflections upon hidden information that enact a greater psychological toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this research hasn’t shown a causal link between secret-related mind-wandering and wellbeing because the results are correlational (it would be hard to test this experimentally because it would be unethical to insert troubling life secrets into people’s lives). It seems likely that the association is at least partly caused by some toxic secrets both springing into mind more readily and having their own directly harmful influence on a person’s life. However, further analysis showed that higher secret-related mind-wandering still correlated with lower wellbeing regardless of the importance of a secret or the deviancy of the information it contained – suggesting repetitive thoughts about any kind of secret can take a toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about secrets that are more obviously troubling to conceal (such as hiding an affair or trauma from a loved one) – might the act of concealment itself take a greater toll in these situations? To check this, the researchers focused in further studies on weightier secrets that the participants felt guilty for keeping from their partner. Yet participants still described mind-wandering about the secret more often than having to conceal it (one longitudinal study estimated mind wandering to be 2.5 times more frequent than concealment). And again, more frequent mind-wandering was associated with lower wellbeing, both in terms of diminished life satisfaction and relationship quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these results are accurate and mind-wandering about secrets really does chip away at our wellbeing, what is the psychological process? It’s psychologically harmful to ruminate on negative thoughts or memories, and recalling a secret often involves accessing such content, so perhaps the same process is at play? It seems not. Slepian’s team asked 186 more participants to either recall a negative life event known to their partner or a secret they kept from them. Participants considered the negative life event more unpleasant than did those in the secret group, but it was the latter group who reported feeling less satisfied with life in that moment, suggesting that this wellbeing drop wasn’t simply a matter of bad feeling. Rather, the secrecy-related dissatisfaction was associated with a self-reported sense of weakened authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often feel forced to keep a secret because we fear the cost of revealing it. But this research suggests that the secret is already costing you, even when you’re not actively concealing it, through a steady drip of reminders that makes you resent your own obstruction of a well-lived life. That doesn’t mean that it’s straightforward to put aside the deception. But if you can find a way, it may change how you experience life: not just through the big release, but a freer mental space, day on day.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The neuropeptide NMU amplifies ILC2-driven allergic lung inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24029</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) both contribute to mucosal homeostasis and initiate pathologic inflammation in allergic asthma. However, the signals that direct ILC2s to promote homeostasis versus inflammation are unclear. To identify such molecular cues, we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA sequencing at steady state and after in vivo stimulation with the alarmin cytokines IL-25 and IL-33. ILC2s were transcriptionally heterogeneous after activation, with subpopulations distinguished by expression of proliferative, homeostatic and effector genes. The neuropeptide receptor Nmur1 was preferentially expressed by ILC2s at steady state and after IL-25 stimulation. Neuromedin U (NMU), the ligand of NMUR1, activated ILC2s in vitro, and in vivo co-administration of NMU with IL-25 strongly amplified allergic inflammation. Loss of NMU–NMUR1 signalling reduced ILC2 frequency and effector function, and altered transcriptional programs following allergen challenge in vivo. Thus, NMUR1 signalling promotes inflammatory ILC2 responses, highlighting the importance of neuro-immune crosstalk in allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Maternal gut bacteria promote neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mouse offspring</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23910</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Maternal immune activation (MIA) contributes to behavioural abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in both primate and rodent offspring. In humans, epidemiological studies suggest that exposure of fetuses to maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of developing autism spectrum disorder. In pregnant mice, interleukin-17a (IL-17a) produced by T helper 17 (TH17) cells (CD4+ T helper effector cells involved in multiple inflammatory conditions) induces behavioural and cortical abnormalities in the offspring exposed to MIA. However, it is unclear whether other maternal factors are required to promote MIA-associated phenotypes. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms by which MIA leads to T cell activation with increased IL-17a in the maternal circulation are not well understood. Here we show that MIA phenotypes in offspring require maternal intestinal bacteria that promote TH17 cell differentiation. Pregnant mice that had been colonized with mouse commensal segmented filamentous bacteria or human commensal bacteria that induce intestinal TH17 cells were more likely to produce offspring with MIA-associated abnormalities. We also show that small intestine dendritic cells from pregnant, but not from non-pregnant, females secrete IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6 and stimulate T cells to produce IL-17a upon exposure to MIA. Overall, our data suggest that defined gut commensal bacteria with a propensity to induce TH17 cells may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring of pregnant mothers undergoing immune system activation owing to infections or autoinflammatory syndromes.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Reversing behavioural abnormalities in mice exposed to maternal inflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Viral infection during pregnancy is correlated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders, and this is studied in mice prenatally subjected to maternal immune activation (MIA). We previously showed that maternal T helper 17 cells promote the development of cortical and behavioural abnormalities in MIA-affected offspring. Here we show that cortical abnormalities are preferentially localized to a region encompassing the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1DZ). Moreover, activation of pyramidal neurons in this cortical region was sufficient to induce MIA-associated behavioural phenotypes in wild-type animals, whereas reduction in neural activity rescued the behavioural abnormalities in MIA-affected offspring. Sociability and repetitive behavioural phenotypes could be selectively modulated according to the efferent targets of S1DZ. Our work identifies a cortical region primarily, if not exclusively, centred on the S1DZ as the major node of a neural network that mediates behavioural abnormalities observed in offspring exposed to maternal inflammation.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The cryo-electron microscopy structure of human transcription factor IIH</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23903</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Human transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is part of the general transcriptional machinery required by RNA polymerase II for the initiation of eukaryotic gene transcription. Composed of ten subunits that add up to a molecular mass of about 500 kDa, TFIIH is also essential for nucleotide excision repair. The seven-subunit TFIIH core complex formed by XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8 is competent for DNA repair, while the CDK-activating kinase subcomplex, which includes the kinase activity of CDK7 as well as the cyclin H and MAT1 subunits, is additionally required for transcription initiation. Mutations in the TFIIH subunits XPB, XPD, and p8 lead to severe premature ageing and cancer propensity in the genetic diseases xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, highlighting the importance of TFIIH for cellular physiology. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TFIIH at 4.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the TFIIH core complex, the detailed structures of its constituent XPB and XPD ATPases, and how the core and kinase subcomplexes of TFIIH are connected. Additionally, our structure provides insight into the conformational dynamics of TFIIH and the regulation of its activity.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Alternative evolutionary histories in the sequence space of an ancient protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23902</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 To understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did, we must characterize not only the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular sequences but also the many alternative trajectories that could have been taken but were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction with deep mutational scanning to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms. We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: The Apostasia genome and the evolution of orchids</title>

 Constituting approximately 10% of flowering plant species, orchids (Orchidaceae) display unique flower morphologies, possess an extraordinary diversity in lifestyle, and have successfully colonized almost every habitat on Earth. Here we report the draft genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica, a representative of one of two genera that form a sister lineage to the rest of the Orchidaceae, providing a reference for inferring the genome content and structure of the most recent common ancestor of all extant orchids and improving our understanding of their origins and evolution. In addition, we present transcriptome data for representatives of Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae and Orchidoideae, and novel third-generation genome data for two species of Epidendroideae, covering all five orchid subfamilies. A. shenzhenica shows clear evidence of a whole-genome duplication, which is shared by all orchids and occurred shortly before their divergence. Comparisons between A. shenzhenica and other orchids and angiosperms also permitted the reconstruction of an ancestral orchid gene toolkit. We identify new gene families, gene family expansions and contractions, and changes within MADS-box gene classes, which control a diverse suite of developmental processes, during orchid evolution. This study sheds new light on the genetic mechanisms underpinning key orchid innovations, including the development of the labellum and gynostemium, pollinia, and seeds without endosperm, as well as the evolution of epiphytism; reveals relationships between the Orchidaceae subfamilies; and helps clarify the evolutionary history of orchids within the angiosperms.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: cGAS senses long and HMGB/TFAM-bound U-turn DNA by forming protein–DNA ladders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23890</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular pathogens triggers a powerful innate immune response. It is sensed by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which elicits the production of type I interferons by generating the second messenger 2′3′-cyclic-GMP–AMP (cGAMP). Endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA can also be sensed by cGAS under certain conditions, resulting in sterile inflammation. The cGAS dimer binds two DNA ligands shorter than 20 base pairs side-by-side, but 20-base-pair DNA fails to activate cGAS in vivo and is a poor activator in vitro. Here we show that cGAS is activated in a strongly DNA length-dependent manner both in vitro and in human cells. We also show that cGAS dimers form ladder-like networks with DNA, leading to cooperative sensing of DNA length: assembly of the pioneering cGAS dimer between two DNA molecules is ineffective; but, once formed, it prearranges the flanking DNA to promote binding of subsequent cGAS dimers. Remarkably, bacterial and mitochondrial nucleoid proteins HU and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), as well as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), can strongly stimulate long DNA sensing by cGAS. U-turns and bends in DNA induced by these proteins pre-structure DNA to nucleate cGAS dimers. Our results suggest a nucleation-cooperativity-based mechanism for sensitive detection of mitochondrial DNA and pathogen genomes, and identify HMGB/TFAM proteins as DNA-structuring host factors. They provide an explanation for the peculiar cGAS dimer structure and suggest that cGAS preferentially binds incomplete nucleoid-like structures or bent DNA.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: Rabies screen reveals GPe control of cocaine-triggered plasticity</title>

 Identification of neural circuit changes that contribute to behavioural plasticity has routinely been conducted on candidate circuits that were preselected on the basis of previous results. Here we present an unbiased method for identifying experience-triggered circuit-level changes in neuronal ensembles in mice. Using rabies virus monosynaptic tracing, we mapped cocaine-induced global changes in inputs onto neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Cocaine increased rabies-labelled inputs from the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a basal ganglia nucleus not previously known to participate in behavioural plasticity triggered by drugs of abuse. We demonstrated that cocaine increased GPe neuron activity, which accounted for the increase in GPe labelling. Inhibition of GPe activity revealed that it contributes to two forms of cocaine-triggered behavioural plasticity, at least in part by disinhibiting dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. These results suggest that rabies-based unbiased screening of changes in input populations can identify previously unappreciated circuit elements that critically support behavioural adaptations.

 The 4D Nucleome Network aims to develop and apply approaches to map the structure and dynamics of the human and mouse genomes in space and time with the goal of gaining deeper mechanistic insights into how the nucleus is organized and functions. The project will develop and benchmark experimental and computational approaches for measuring genome conformation and nuclear organization, and investigate how these contribute to gene regulation and other genome functions. Validated experimental technologies will be combined with biophysical approaches to generate quantitative models of spatial genome organization in different biological states, both in cell populations and in single cells.

	<title>Nature Biological Sciences Research: SAM-dependent enzyme-catalysed pericyclic reactions in natural product biosynthesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23882</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Pericyclic reactions—which proceed in a concerted fashion through a cyclic transition state—are among the most powerful synthetic transformations used to make multiple regioselective and stereoselective carbon–carbon bonds. They have been widely applied to the synthesis of biologically active complex natural products containing contiguous stereogenic carbon centres. Despite the prominence of pericyclic reactions in total synthesis, only three naturally existing enzymatic examples (the intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction, and the Cope and the Claisen rearrangements) have been characterized. Here we report a versatile S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme, LepI, that can catalyse stereoselective dehydration followed by three pericyclic transformations: intramolecular Diels–Alder and hetero-Diels–Alder reactions via a single ambimodal transition state, and a retro-Claisen rearrangement. Together, these transformations lead to the formation of the dihydropyran core of the fungal natural product, leporin. Combined in vitro enzymatic characterization and computational studies provide insight into how LepI regulates these bifurcating biosynthetic reaction pathways by using SAM as the cofactor. These pathways converge to the desired biosynthetic end product via the (SAM-dependent) retro-Claisen rearrangement catalysed by LepI. We expect that more pericyclic biosynthetic enzymatic transformations remain to be discovered in naturally occurring enzyme ‘toolboxes’. The new role of the versatile cofactor SAM is likely to be found in other examples of enzyme catalysis.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
 Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission has long been considered a cellular correlate for learning and memory. Early LTP (less than 1 h) had initially been explained either by presynaptic increases in glutamate release or by direct modification of postsynaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor function. Compelling models have more recently proposed that synaptic potentiation can occur by the recruitment of additional postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), sourced either from an intracellular reserve pool by exocytosis or from nearby extra-synaptic receptors pre-existing on the neuronal surface. However, the exact mechanism through which synapses can rapidly recruit new AMPARs during early LTP remains unknown. In particular, direct evidence for a pivotal role of AMPAR surface diffusion as a trafficking mechanism in synaptic plasticity is still lacking. Here, using AMPAR immobilization approaches, we show that interfering with AMPAR surface diffusion markedly impairs synaptic potentiation of Schaffer collaterals and commissural inputs to the CA1 area of the mouse hippocampus in cultured slices, acute slices and in vivo. Our data also identify distinct contributions of various AMPAR trafficking routes to the temporal profile of synaptic potentiation. In addition, AMPAR immobilization in vivo in the dorsal hippocampus inhibited fear conditioning, indicating that AMPAR diffusion is important for the early phase of contextual learning. Therefore, our results provide a direct demonstration that the recruitment of new receptors to synapses by surface diffusion is a critical mechanism for the expression of LTP and hippocampal learning. Since AMPAR surface diffusion is dictated by weak Brownian forces that are readily perturbed by protein–protein interactions, we anticipate that this fundamental trafficking mechanism will be a key target for modulating synaptic potentiation and learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The University of Copenhagen has stripped Milena Penkowa of her doctoral degree, after determining she had covered up problems with her research. According to a release issued today by the university, Penkowa falsified documents to allay suspicions that she had not performed some animal experiments as she’d reported. This development is the latest in a […]&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Official PLOS Blog: To Sign or Not to Sign: A Slice of Transparency in Peer Review</title>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/veLAChjX0Ow/</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/09/slice-of-pie-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;0000-0001-7318-5892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists depend on the proper evaluation of research that creates the foundation for future work, and the public expects curated scientific content to be trustworthy. All forms of peer review, whether for ethical, technical and sound science criteria or for additional novelty, significance and perceived impact help ensure rigor in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, community and public skepticism regarding the quality, trustworthiness and authenticity of the review process, from the initial stage of evaluation before reviewer assignment to the final editorial decision. Making peer review more transparent, at any stage, has the potential to revitalize the process and restore trust in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to increase transparency in peer review should address challenges that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/09/how-review-paper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Training and mentoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/12/13/how-to-become-good-at-peer-review-a-guide-for-young-scientists/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how to review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/27/peer-review-10-tips-research-paper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see ten tips here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable publisher &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=home&amp;amp;section=monitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open science and transparency policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A process that is static in time and in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;number of people that participate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insights made during the review process often go &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uncaptured or remain hidden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reshaping Peer Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is already happening as the scientific community develops variations on themes of open and transparent, and as publishers provide more peer review offerings that range from community participation to open but anonymous, to fully open and signed reviews. While not yet functioning at scale, experiments incorporating more transparent ways to discuss and assess papers over the entire lifecycle of the research are inching their way into practice. This way, the publication of an article isn’t the single defining event in its life; it is just one chapter of its story. Many of the arguments in favor of increased transparency in peer review also hold true in the discussion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benefits of preprint submissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. According to researchers working with neuroimaging, as stated in their &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, “preprints allow the wider community to give feedback to the authors about the manuscript and potentially improve it, which is beneficial for both the authors as well as the journal the paper will be submitted to. For example, the present paper received useful comments from three individuals in addition to the appointed peer reviewers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Question of Signing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PLOS, we’ve looked at one slice of transparency in peer review—signed reviews made available exclusively to the authors. In a research project that used a survey mechanism to collect experiences and opinions, our Publishing Operations team underwent an assessment of reviews from 2013-2016 in three of the PLOS journals (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our reviewer community is particularly engaged, and that’s what makes working at PLOS on this issue so exciting. Together we will be able to create solutions, both incremental and substantial, that bring constructive feedback to authors and transparency to the review process.” Helen Atkins, PLOS Director of Publishing Operations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what we learned is that reviewers who were not in the habit of signing reviews simply had never been asked, or were not sure of the benefits. But it’s not as easy as just educating in these areas. These scientists also indicated that not signing allows them to be more honest and safe from retribution. We also discovered that signing can improve reviewer accountability and constructiveness, and help authors learn of a reviewer’s area of expertise. Authors who favored receiving signed reviews valued having this additional information as it provides potential for more open communication, moving research forward. The full results of this project, presented by Elizabeth Seiver, PLOS Researcher and Helen Atkins are part of the Editorial and Peer-Review Process Innovations Session on Tuesday, September 12 during the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peerreviewcongress.org/program-information&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple but Substantive Practices &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147913&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peer Review Quality and Transparency of the Peer-Review Process in Open Access and Subscription Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” the focus is a general aspect of transparency in peer review—how academic journals (and/or publishers) present their peer-review process to the public. According to the authors of this study, a transparent peer review system “conveys to readers and potential contributors how the peer review is implemented and how articles are selected for publication.” The researchers found that “author’s ratings of peer-review transparency predicted their assessment of the quality of peer-review at that journal.”  Even small changes in practices and on publisher websites can help in this area. In addition, guidelines from the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Committee on Publication Ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://publicationethics.org/files/Principles_of_Transparency_and_Best_Practice_in_Scholarly_Publishing.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” stating that all journal content apart from editorial material should be subject to peer review from outside experts must be met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Early Career Researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ECRs do not get appropriate training on how to prepare or review manuscripts. Improved transparency in peer review would not only satisfy mid-to senior-level scientists, but in providing some form of open dialogue or open accountability it enables these scientists to lead by example and provide mentorship to the next generation of reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young and upcoming scientists have plenty of ideas when it comes to improving transparency in peer review. At PLOS, we received over 150 essays on how to revamp peer review from Early Career Researchers applying for our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/ecr-travel-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ECR Travel Award Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These creative young scientists described what they consider to be characteristics of the optimal peer review process and how they might build this process either from scratch or using aspects of existing practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ideas, edited for brevity, include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite reviewers to publish reviews of the article (should they wish to reveal their identity) as an accompanying commentary, for no additional fee. If reviewers know they could gain an additional publication for their efforts, this would motivate them to review more articles and respond in a constructive and timely fashion. Victoria Leong; orcid.org/0000-0003-0666-9445&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Provide] incentives for reviewing that encourages kind, open but fair responses; we would also be affecting a positive change in the culture of science; which will advance the science itself. Rebecca Gelding; orcid.org/0000-0003-4883-8075&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews should be open, archived and after publication, reviewers should be revealed. This aims to ensure two aspects of quality control: reviewers take more seriously their job since it will be public with their name tag on it; and reviewing records can be used when considering career development. Juan Rocha; orcid.org/0000-0003-2322-5459&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review record should also be one of the criteria judging and advancing a researcher’s professional development. Knowing that a reviewer’s identify would be revealed later and shared among peers, a reviewer would have more incentive to avoid giving low-quality comments. Xiao-Peng Song; orcid.org/0000-0002-5514-0321&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A transparent, open review process may promote accountability among reviewers. A peer reviewer whose dated comments are published as supplementary material with the article has a greater incentive to conduct a thorough and timely review of the manuscript. These same published comments could also be accessed by other researchers who are struggling to address similar issues in their own studies. Sericea Stallings-Smith; orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-9965&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slices of the Transparency Pie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solutions that will help peer review achieve its scholarly ideal are not untenable; the challenge lies in that they must satisfy a diverse researcher and stakeholder community. While some improvements are easier to implement than others, even small slices that expedite and enrich the process of assessment in fundamentally new ways contribute to advancing science and discovery for the broader scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers have an opportunity to improve both speed and efficiencies: to improve review forms that may be cumbersome or insufficient to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback to authors and to provide training for reviewers and editors that mitigate potential bias. Additional possibilities include direct or facilitated mentoring of early career researchers to improve their understanding of the principles of peer review and how it is practiced within the scientific community. Imagine the impact of a global editorial and reviewer contributor community, appropriately trained, recognized and incentivized.&lt;/p&gt;
