	<description>In an eyebrow-raising new paper, neuroscientists report that they had participants wear a ball gag while watching images of people in pain. The lucky participants in this neuro-bondage were all female BDSM submissives, and their brain activity in response to the painful pictures was recorded with EEG.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;Achieve Open Access: the free dissemination of scientific knowledge in the digital era&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simone, A. (ed.). [e-Book] Fare Open Access: La libera diffusione del sapere scientifico nell’era digitale. Napoli, Ledizioni – LediPublishing, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fare Open Access&quot; addresses with a positive and operative approach the strategic issue of the dissemination of scientific knowledge in an open perspective. Open access has become one of the key objectives of the innovation policies of the European Union and the main industrialized countries, and it is essential to know their theoretical characteristics and their concrete potential. All authors are active professionals for many years in this field and, therefore, have the pulse of emerging issues and critical issues, not only from a theoretical-doctrinal point of view. Each one of them faces from different perspectives the most general topic of scientific communication and the practical one of how to do Open Access in the current digital panorama. The text is completed with a useful appendix with reference documents, such as the main texts-manifestos and the norms currently in force at national and international level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;OSF (Open Science Framework) Aiming for open psychology research&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, The 51st Annual Meeting of the Society for Mathematical Psychology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also known as MathPsych / ICCM 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this conference, research presentations on Bayesian Cognitive Modeling are actively conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many psychologists participating in this society are interested in Bayesian statistical modeling as well as psychological reproducibility problems, understand psychological phenomena from a methodology or a broader perspective In order to do research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them, &quot;visualization&quot; of research using OSF is becoming mast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, efforts are also being made to share slides and posters announced at MathPsych in one place and open them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we will briefly summarize how to use OSF when writing a paper (or research presentation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(First of all, since I learned that there was an anonymous function for peer review when I was fiddling with OSF recently, I will write it as a memorandum for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you do not know OSF, please see this slide....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...This paper investigates the adoption and promotion of open access [OA] within the Arts. For clarity the Arts, when mentioned in this paper, is defined as including art history and practicing artists and their very different needs when considering OA compared to that of the STEM subjects. Too often is art history separated from the practicing arts when the barriers of implementing OA are the same. Three institutional projects are examined and the success in which these projects aided OA. Where it can be established that definite forms of adoption and promotion have taken place in the arts this is fragmented and does not create uniformity across the sectors.  Consistency and standardisation is needed for OA to be fully accepted by the Arts....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;It occurs to me today that a lot of students and academic researchers do not know much about Sci-hub that they can download journals and research paper from Sci-hub. They only go to Google to search for research papers, eBooks, and textbooks when they can get the latest article from top scholars free from Sci hub. Not to talk about the usefulness of the internet to human existence. Other internet facilities like social media and browsers extensions such as eBook downloader browsers extension worth human attention and make use of it to its fulfillment. There are websites where you can search and download research papers and journal articles for free. Most of the websites do not require a login access before you can search and download journal articles in your field of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub Journal Site Alternatives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that sci hub is a popular website used by top researchers and they are also some popular websites where you can download articles journals’ for free legally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpaywall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpaywall is a website built to help the researchers to gather all journal article in a single archive where they’d have direct access to it and download. It’s claimed that all article journal available in Unpaywall website is 50-85% of all the journal published for a legal download....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Joni Coleman tackles the complex subject of delivering transparent, robust science to all – and almost manages not to talk about Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever volunteered to take part in research: you should be angry. If you pay your taxes: you should be angry. If you believe the scientific method is central to rationalism, modernity, and progress: YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY. Because much of science is failing you. Last year, well over a million papers were published in the biomedical sciences alone, many of which will have been funded through public or charitable monies, and will have relied inescapably on the generosity of participants. But (unless you are lucky enough to have access to a subscription) many of them will be unavailable for you to read. Science is, to a great extent, a closed shop....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sacred Heart University has received a $2,500 grant from the Davis Educational Foundation to establish a faculty fellowship in open educational resources (OER) for the 2018-19 academic year. Open educational resources constitute free digital assets such as online research repositories, curriculum-sharing websites and freely accessible, online alternatives to textbooks. Frank Robinson, assistant professor of physics and director of SHU’s Engineering 3+2 program, will fill the fellowship, devoting time to supporting the colleges, departments, programs and individual faculty in creation and integration of OER into courses. He also will work with librarians to identify existing quality OER alternatives to course materials and offer a series of workshops on the importance of the OER initiative as it relates to equity and affordability for students. ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While engaging online learning process, student support is the crucial element to provide active participation and match learners’ needs and expectations during the process. Within a framework of online pedagogy, learner development is challenging pattern and heart of the online practices which mainly three components have been underlined: (1) student support, (2) institutional support, and (3) teaching learning process including assessment as learning procedure in higher education. This study aims to provide an example of open resources education course for orthopedically disabled learners which online training course supports learners and their families for their professional development within a frame of counseling and guidance. The study is significant to underline the principles of online pedagogy within the process and enrich abilities of learners including family members in particular contents. Furthermore, the study shows how open education resources could be motivation for social learning within the life as part of the life-long learning philosophy.  In addition to that, it contributes to underline the success of effective pedagogy in online context for learners with disabilities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;A professional workshop on Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) that is aimed at providing anyone, anywhere open access to biodiversity data information about all types of life on earth, is currently taking place at the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) Headquarters in Monrovia. Coordinated through its Secretariat in Copenhagen, GBIF provides data-holding institutions around the world with common standards and open-source tools that enable these countries to share information about where and when species have been recorded. Accordingly, this organization's index of hundreds of millions of species occurrence knowledge derives from many sources, including everything from museum specimens collected in the 18th and 19th century, to geotagged smartphone photos shared by armature naturalists in recent days and weeks. The GBIF network draws all these sources together through the use of the Darwin Core Standard, which forms the basis of GBIF organizations index of hundreds of millions of species occurrence records....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Google English: &quot;The legal open data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a connected world where phenomenal amounts of data circulate day and night across the globe. While Big Data is defined by its size, Open Data is characterized by its use, its openness, its intention to democratize information for the benefit of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Université de Montréal's Cyberjustice Laboratory, a team of young researchers has decided - as part of a bilateral project between Quebec and Belgium - to create a blog to understand the impact that the transition can have on the law. digital. This first post will focus on the issue of Open Data Legal. Open data consists of making freely accessible digital data available to everyone on the Internet, so legal open data is the declination in the legal sector. We will therefore first see what this open data consists of, in a second time their use by the lawyers and finally, the problems related to this process of opening the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall on the Open data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the definition of the Office québécois de la langue française, open data is &quot;non-nominal, royalty-free raw data produced or collected by a public or private body that is accessible to citizens over the Internet. Several countries, including Canada, have made it their mission to open up more data that can foster innovation, scientific advancement and the development of new knowledge and technologies....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Feb 2018, Hypothesis and the Center for Open Science (COS) announced their collaboration to bring open annotation to Open Science Framework (OSF) Preprints and the growing community of preprint servers hosted on OSF. Today, we are proud to announce that open annotation is now live, starting with OSF Preprints, SocArXiv, PsyArXiv, BITSS, EngrXiv, PaleorXiv, SportrXiv, Thesis Commons, MarXiv, INarXiv, NutriXiv, EarthArxiv, and the newest member of the community AfricArxiv. Annotation on preprints will increase transparency in scientific practices by enabling researchers to collaborate, discuss research with peers, and share additional information directly on preprints both before and after they are posted. The partnership builds on the foundations laid by the publication of web annotation as a standard by the W3C, the pioneering work by Hypothesis to build an open annotation infrastructure, and by COS to offer OSF, a comprehensive platform for open scientific research and publication....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: انتشار حركة الوصول الحر للنشر العلمي في البلدان العربية: دراسة فينومينولوجية | Diffusion of Open Access in Arab Countries | Jaber | Zenodo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://zenodo.org/record/1320741#.W1j0GmaZNE4</guid>
	<link>https://zenodo.org/record/1320741#.W1j0GmaZNE4</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Open Access emerged as a revolutionary movement in Western societies in order to solve the current scholarly communication system crises. Its diffusion in Arab countries took place in a research environment that mostly lacks national research agendas and adequate research budgets. The study aimed at exploring in detail and interpreting how participants are making sense of their lived experience with Open Access. The study adopted a phenomenological approach using Interpretative phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology to answer the main question: How does the Open Access movement to scientific publishing diffuse in Arab countries from the perspective of scholars/ practitioners? Two research tools were used, the critical and systematic literature review, and the semi-structured interview with ten participants. The study was divided into five chapters and a general introduction: the introduction addressed the problem of the study, its research questions, its objectives and its relevance; and briefly sketched the research design. In chapter, one, fifty-three Arab studies from 2005 to 2015, were reviewed and classified into themes and subjects. The second chapter discusses in detail the theoretical approach. The third chapter elaborates the methodology. The fourth chapter displayed the findings from the analysis of the ten interviews; seven superordinate themes with thirty themes were issued. The concluding fifth chapter discussed the results by referring to the Diffusion of Innovations theory and the adoption of a critical approach based on Western cognitive hegemony. The study concluded to the following main results: The concept of Open Access is cultural response against the dominant Western concept. Its diffusion is still limited and beset by many individual and external barriers, notably the lack of national research policies and agendas. The adoption decision by Arab institutions is an authoritative decision that comes in response to the international pressure to join the knowledge society. The impact of Open Access adoption remains debatable, especially since scientific publishing, Open Access included, is not an isolated industry from the dominant global economic, political and technological situation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the 18th of June, the Kick Off took place of the Open Science Community Utrecht. Read below how this was celebrated and why this community is essential for Utrecht University. What is the Open Science Community Utrecht (OSCU) all about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anita Eerland &amp;amp; Loek Brinkman kicked off the evening with a short intro on why they started OSCU; to increase the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of science by facilitating wide-scale adoption of Open Science practices. OSCU is a platform to learn about and discuss open science and its incorporation in our workflows. Therefore, OSCU will host Open Science workshops and Open Science Cafés as of next academic year. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was Daniel Oberski (Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences and UYA) explained that open science is not only about open access publishing and sharing data. It’s about transparency in all steps of the research cycle, including open materials and open software. In addition, he gave multiple examples of how he benefited from adopting open science practices, in terms of correcting errors, and increasing visibility and societal impact. ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://beprexit.wordpress.com/2018/07/25/survey-open-access/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The following post is in reference to a survey given in May 2018. For more information, see previous posts on our Survey Methodology, Survey Demographics, and Survey Questions &amp;amp; Reflections (the full survey is available for download and reuse under a CC0 license).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our survey, we wanted to learn more about how our community approaches a few open access issues, such as having an open access requirement, retaining rights when publishing, and sharing non-final versions of a work. While there will certainly be more posts that touch on open access themes, this one directly addresses a few of these specific questions on our survey. We will be posting on other themes in the future. — The University of Pennsylvania faculty released a Faculty Open-Access Statement of Principles for Scholarly Articles in 2011 but does not have an open access requirement. In our survey, we asked participants to about their position on having a policy at Penn...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many government officials (in the data environment) around the world put some weight on the international rankings for Open Data produced by people like the Open Data Barometer or Open Knowledge International. If their own country goes up in the charts they like to blow their own trumpets or if they go down, gnash their teeth. The same applies in the UK. A few weeks ago I heard someone very senior in UK government digital put up a slide saying ‘hurrah’ the UK is recognised as a world leader. All these rankings should be viewed with some caution. They each have their own methodological approaches and individual quirks. Fortunately there is a programme of work by a number of these assessment organisations to synchronise their work and develop some more consistent approaches. If you want to know more talk to Danny Lammerhirt at Open Knowledge (easy to find on Twitter)....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Open Access Tracking Project: A community college confronts the costs of open educational resources</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The news releases regularly roll in to the email inbox these days with headlines like &quot;College X has saved students $5 million by adopting open educational resources.&quot; Not only have these initiatives made a higher education more affordable, the colleges and universities note, but students who might have forgone buying an expensive textbook in the past are actually getting and using the OER content, ideally contributing to their academic success. Amid those successes, rarely mentioned is the reality that in many cases, the institution itself is picking up the costs that were formally borne by the students, through some combination of direct subsidies to instructors to create the content and a loss of textbook revenue to a campus store, among other costs. A session this week at the annual meeting of the National Association of College and University Business Officers addressed that issue head-on, in a way that would be unusual at a conference of OER advocates. It's not that the session took a skeptical view of OER -- far from it. The featured institution, the Pierce College District in Washington State, has fully embraced the use of open resources for affordability and efficacy, among other reasons. But the enthusiasm of the community college's open education project manager, Quill West, was balanced by the even-keeled acknowledgment of Choi Halladay, the district's vice president of administrative services, that OER comes at a price to the institution -- though a price very much worth paying, he said....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Making research papers, data and methodologies freely accessible for anyone to read and use has gained significant ground in recent years, but several challenges remain to widespread implementation. That’s the conclusion of a new report into “open science” by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), which calls on universities and publishers to issue new processes to improve how science can be freely accessed. Open science aims to make research papers and data, as well as methodologies such as code or algorithms, freely available. NASEM’s report, Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century Research, identifies several recent initiatives that have advanced open science – such as citizen-science projects – and highlights the increase in research funded by organizations that require the outputs to be open for everyone to read and use....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Today we’re announcing that we are joining the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a partner on the STRIDES (Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability) Initiative to bring the power of Google Cloud to biomedical research. As part of this agreement, we’ll make some of the most important NIH-funded datasets available to users with appropriate privacy controls. To simplify access to these datasets, we’ll integrate researcher authentication and authorization mechanisms with Google Cloud credentials. And we’re working with the Global Alliance for Genomics &amp;amp; Health and the BioCompute Consortium to support industry standards for data access, discovery, and cloud computation. In addition to this partnership, we’re continuing to develop a suite of open source tools, such as Variant Transforms, to structure and integrate biomedical datasets using BigQuery, our highly-scalable managed data warehouse solution....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience: Unconventional Connections: How Inhibition Hones Cortical Selectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/?p=11076</guid>
	<link>https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/unconventional-connections-how-inhibition-hones-cortical-selectivity/</link>
	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience discover a fundamentally new role for inhibition in the visual cortex, refining how neurons encode object motion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains do a remarkable job of encoding visual information about the world around us, providing an almost instantaneous report about rapidly changing conditions that is critical for guiding our behavior. Integral to the brain’s encoding mechanism is the presence of neurons that respond selectively to specific visual features, generating electrical activity that reliably signals properties such as the orientation of edges, their position in space, and their direction of motion. By using new tools to probe the principles of connectivity that neural circuits use to generate selective responses, scientists at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience are gaining a host of new insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neural circuits build response selectivity poses an enormous challenge since a single neuron receives thousands of synaptic inputs derived from other neurons and these inputs can differ in their response properties and how they can affect the neuron. Some inputs are excitatory, making the neuron more likely to generate an electrical signal, while others are inhibitory, reducing the likelihood that the neuron generates a signal. Somehow a neuron integrates all of these excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to generate responses that are selective, a mysterious ‘input/output transform’ that has been the subject of intense research interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that there are some simple rules that govern excitatory and inhibitory functional connections. A prominent rule that has emerged for excitatory connections is the notion “like connects with like.” For example, in the visual cortex, neurons that respond selectively to a particular direction of motion are thought to receive their excitatory inputs from other neurons that respond selectively to the same direction of motion. An equally important rule has been postulated for inhibitory inputs: the idea that the properties of the inhibitory inputs a neuron receives match the properties of its excitatory inputs. Because of the “matching rule”, inhibitory inputs are thought to adjust the strength of the excitatory inputs, but not to alter the selectivity conveyed to the neuron by its excitatory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 510px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Figure-1-final.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Figure-1-final.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Cartoon model of co-tuning (top) and differential tuning (bottom) of excitation (G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and inhibition (G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) for direction. Subthreshold direction selectivity is inherited from synaptic conductances when co-tuned. Differential tuning of excitation and inhibition can preferentially suppress excitation and enhance subthreshold selectivity. With differential tuning, inhibition can be either bidirectional or oppositely tunned for direction relative to excitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a recent publication in Nature, researchers in David Fitzpatrick’s Lab, Daniel Wilson, Ph.D., and Benjamin Scholl, Ph.D., have accumulated multiple lines of evidence that challenge both of these principles, providing a new perspective on how circuits in visual cortex employ excitation and inhibition to generate neuronal responses that are selective for an object’s direction of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPFI researchers first needed a better picture of the direction selectivity supplied by a neuron’s excitatory synaptic inputs. To do this they used in vivo two-photon microscopy to characterize the direction selectivity of individual excitatory synaptic inputs onto the dendrites of a neuron, comparing this with the neuron’s overall direction preference. Surprisingly, what they discovered goes against the grain of traditional thinking. Although, many of the synapses aligned with the overall directional preference of the neuron, a large number were found to respond best to the opposite (null) direction of motion, a pattern of connectivity that contrasts sharply with “like connects with like” rule. They also noticed a conspicuous mismatch between the strength of a neuron’s direction selectivity, and that predicted by its excitatory synaptic inputs. The degree of direction selectivity that the neurons exhibited was significantly greater than what would have been expected from such a broad range of excitatory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further probe the factor(s) responsible for this puzzling difference between the neuron’s excitatory inputs and its output, they turned to a different set of experiments using in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. This technique makes it possible to measure the total sum of synaptic inputs contributing to a neuron’s response and to compare the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. The results for the excitatory inputs were consistent with the two-photon imaging data confirming a significant amount of excitatory input for both the preferred and the null direction of motion. The results for inhibition provided the team with another challenge to traditional thinking and a potential explanation for the puzzling input/output difference: In fact, the tuning of the inhibitory inputs did not match the excitatory inputs. For many neurons the strength of inhibition was greatest for the null direction of motion, suggesting that excitatory synaptic inputs to the null direction were being selectively dampened through inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings predict that cortical inhibitory neurons make a substantial number of synaptic inputs to excitatory neurons that prefer the opposite direction of motion. The researchers applied two novel approaches to examine this question, first charting the anatomical connections of functionally defined inhibitory neurons, and then using optogenetics (selectively activating inhibitory neurons with light) to map the source of inhibitory inputs to single excitatory neurons. In tandem, these techniques confirmed that inhibitory connections to excitatory neurons often originated from neurons that preferred the opposite direction of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond disentangling the mechanism responsible for direction selectivity, these discoveries emphasize the flexible ways in which neural circuits can integrate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to build the variety of selective response properties critical for neural coding. Like doesn’t always connect with like and excitation doesn’t always match inhibition, but you can count on brain circuits to have evolved the combination of inputs necessary to ensure high levels of functional performance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10400&quot; style=&quot;width: 197px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10400&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Prof-Alan-Lefor.jpg&quot; width=&quot;187&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Prof Alan Lefor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; has already started to accept submissions, what’s the reason to create an open access journal in biomedical engineering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomedical engineering is applied science at the intersection of caring for people. Nothing could be more exciting. It is hoped that &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, as an open access journal, will provide a new and welcoming forum for research from a wide range of investigators, contributing to progress in this important field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As one of the journal’s Section Editors, what is your vision for the journal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vision for the journal is to present quality science in the field of biomedical engineering. That is the single most important requirement. I hope that we will attract authors from all over the world, from the many disciplines that contribute to the field of biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journal should not only be a place to present one’s research, but over time it will become a resource for anyone who wants to know the latest and greatest developments in the field to support and stimulate new research endeavors. In the future, &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; will be the premier journal in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of articles are encouraged?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage the submission of all articles, of all types, that represent research in the broad field of biomedical engineering. Please refer to our detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines&quot;&gt;submission guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, for more instructions on how to prepare your submission, including style and formatting rules for all article types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I know if my article is in line with &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can find descriptions for the scopes of our sections &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, it is very difficult to prepare a list of pre-requisites for an article. We trust the authors to decide if their work is in line with this field. Most importantly we believe in our trusted editorial process with experienced peer reviewers as the final arbiter of what should be published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this new journal will stimulate both new clinical developments and new scientific developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be done to increase the chances of acceptance before submission? Any tips?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important factor for acceptance is that the article (for a research paper) answers an important scientific question and that the study is designed and conducted appropriately to answer that question. Secondarily, authors must take great care in the preparation of the manuscript with regard to format and language usage. The instructions to authors must be followed with meticulous attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared with other journals in the field, what are the differences in positioning of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is uniquely positioned in part because of the section structure of the journal. The six sections of the journal certainly represent the most exciting areas within the broad field of biomedical engineering. This structure benefits both authors and readers with the assurance that the papers are evaluated by the editorial process relative to these six sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe what &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; means to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a clinician, I am interested in anything with the potential to benefit patients. Everything I do is seen through that lens. As a basic scientist, I am excited by anything that is new and interesting. &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is at the nexus of these two passions in my life and I think this new journal will stimulate both new clinical developments and new scientific developments. It is a great honor and privilege for me to be a part of this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you briefly describe your research interests relevant to the field and your relationship with BMC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have devoted my career to the care of patients, and in support of that, I have a long history in clinical research, basic biomedical research, basic scientific research and education. These areas of interest give me a uniquely broad perspective on patient care and biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a deep and long-standing interest in the applications of computers to biomedical research and have conducted studies on tumor models with the hope of improving the understanding of tumor progression. In addition, I was a pioneer in the field of laparoscopic surgery and have a long clinical history of work in this field, including robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also enjoyed a long relationship with &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, first as a Deputy Section Editor and then as a Consulting Editor. I strongly support and deeply respect the conduct and transparency of the editorial process which is part of the BMC journals. This process is deeply embedded in the DNA of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, which benefits our authors, our readers and ultimately most important, our patients who depend on us to advance this field and improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of mothers gaining weight during and beyond pregnancy is well-researched and understood – much of it has to do with the hormonal changes that assist fetal growth and preparation for lactation. Less researched and recognised, other than through jokes about “dad bods”, is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8063004.stm&quot;&gt;many expectant fathers also gain weight&lt;/a&gt;, and that the pounds tend to stay on (one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611005120?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that fathers weigh, on average, 14 pounds more than childless men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2018.1463166&quot;&gt;Health Psychology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by Darby Saxbe at the University of Southern California highlight the evidence for perinatal weight gain in fathers, and they review  seven potential casual mechanisms for why it happens, which they hope will stimulate further research. The lack of empirical research on this phenomenon before now “is striking”, they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34312&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight gain in fathers-to-be and new fathers is a serious public health issue, the researchers point out, because while this added size may have had adaptive benefits in our evolutionary past (for instance, by helping the new father cope with food shortages and deter aggressors), in the modern, sedentary world it is only likely to be associated with health problems, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxbe and her team first considered three potential behavioral mechanisms behind paternal weight gain, beginning with lack of sleep. New fathers typically suffer sleep disruption and sleep problems are well-known to lead to weight gain, including through affecting the hormones that normally regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the lack of exercise – one &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/10.1123/jpah.7.5.577&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that young men who became fathers dropped an average of five hours per week of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked into whether dietary changes could be a relevant mechanism. However, while there is evidence that some new mothers increase their intake of high-fat and high-sugar food, and generally increase their calorie intake, Saxbe and her colleagues could find no evidence for such dietary changes associated with fatherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers considered direct hormonal and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-becoming-a-father-changes-your-brain/&quot;&gt;brain changes&lt;/a&gt; associated with fatherhood. Most consistently, there is evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jne.12176&quot;&gt;fatherhood lowers men’s testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt;, possibly reflecting changing priorities away from competition for mates and toward greater commitment and caring for offspring. Saxbe and her team believe lower testosterone is another plausible mechanism for fathers’ weight gain since lower levels of this hormone are known to be associated with greater fat deposits and reduced muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked into the possible role of raised cortisol – a hormone associated with stress – but they found the evidence for this as a potential mechanism is mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also considered two psychological factors – depression and stress. They found both to be plausible mechanisms – they are known to increase around the time of fatherhood, and both have bi-directional links with weight gain (though the researchers added that the idea of depression as a cause, rather than merely a consequence, of weight gain is less supported).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Saxbe’s team considered the role of expectant fathers’ pregnant partners. As well as the possible part played by phantom pregnancy (or couvade syndrome), there are the normal dynamics of being in a couple to consider, as partners tend to influence each other’s lifestyles and habits – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-923&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that having an obese partner increased one’s own obesity risk six-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the various potential mechanisms that the researchers outlined are closely interlinked. Future longitudinal research that identifies when exactly expectant fathers are most vulnerable to weight gain will help elucidate where each of the proposed mechanisms lies in a causal chain. The researchers also suggest the need for cross-cultural research to see if paternal weight gain is universal, together with investigations into the role of social background and personal psychological factors such as self-control and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such research endeavors are important not only for men’s health, Saxbe and her team point out, but also for family health, especially given prior &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2011198&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that fathers’ obesity may be a greater risk factor for children’s obesity than mothers’ obesity (in fact Saxbe and co suggest that fathers are the “forgotten parent” in childhood obesity research given the lack of interventions targeted at fathers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New fathers deserve more study and attention,” the researchers conclude. “Paternal perinatal weight gain is a real and intriguing phenomenon that may have lifelong health implications for men and their families. In this new area of inquiry, there are exciting opportunities for researchers to discover why and when fathers to gain weight over the transition to parenthood and how best to intervene to reduce the risk of paternal obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2018.1463166&quot;&gt;The weight of fatherhood: identifying mechanisms to explain paternal perinatal weight gain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BMC Series blog: Balancing expectation and reality: intervention fidelity, trauma, and women with histories of incarceration</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/AdobeStock_79346044-3-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1851585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research concept of fidelity&lt;/a&gt;  is a critical component for any health intervention holding itself to a high standard. In terms of the scientific method, this means we want to ensure that when we deliver any kind of intervention, that we replicate it as close to the same way each time, with each group, with minimal variation. Yet, this assumption of fidelity also means an assumption of a certain kind of audience that receives interventions – one that is predictable. An audience without trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kumc.edu/she&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sexual Health Empowerment (SHE) project&lt;/a&gt;, we worked directly with close to 200 women with histories of incarceration to deliver a cervical health promotion intervention.  The SHE team has had years of experience working with women both in and outside of jails. Critical for our work is the constant awareness of the trauma the women we serve bring into the room. From sexual and domestic violence to drug addiction and homelessness, women with histories of incarceration are statistically more likely than most populations to have histories of extensive trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study suggests as many as 86 percent of women in prison have been sexually assaulted. Three quarters of women who have been incarcerated have also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.correctionalassociation.org/issue/domestic-violence&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abused by an intimate partner&lt;/a&gt;. This doesn’t even take into account the trauma and abuse that can occur once women actually enter incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, health educators delivering interventions with women in the criminal justice system must be able to address the unique dynamics of any group and the individuals in these groups, responding in real time to any needs that arise during intervention delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our staff were all trained in emotional grounding techniques that help women move from a state of heightened high emotion to one of calmness.  We employed these techniques regularly during intervention delivery, when conversations got heated, when participants got upset, or when we all needed comfort.  We were prepared to answer any manner of questions and we were lucky to have clinicians (nursing students and faculty) present during the intervention sessions to answer questions about complicated, real-time health needs. In SHE, we worked from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335517300669&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manualized intervention&lt;/a&gt;, yet had to be flexible in order to address the women’s needs and questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health educators delivering the intervention always had to keep the sessions moving, … building rapport, and delivering intervention content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did this in the highly structured and simultaneously chaotic environment of a county jail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0617-x?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women%27s_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_JULY2018_intervention_fidelity&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In our article on intervention fidelity in jails&lt;/a&gt;, we highlight both the nature of women’s questions and the jail itself as challenges to fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were obligated to work with the rules of the jail facility as a condition of being granted access. Such access necessitated flexibility on our parts, working with correctional officers present in the room during private discussions about health, or stopping the intervention if events like lockdowns at the jail precluded our ability to continue. We also had to work around the loss of participants to events within the criminal justice process such as court hearings and disciplinary procedures, or in some cases real-time medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some days there was a constant movement of people in and out of the session, as we described in our fidelity fieldnotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; “At different points during the session, a male guard, a woman who looked like an administrator type, and two nurses entered. Our women were also up and moving around throughout the session—heating coffee in the microwave, getting water—all while our facilitator was talking. One woman disappeared during a bathroom break. We don’t know where she went or why she didn’t return. Two other women went to the desk and visited with the nurses in the middle of the session: one of them had her blood pressure checked. The other seemed to be having something on her foot examined.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health educators delivering the intervention always had to keep the sessions moving, while sensing the feelings of participants and others in the room, protecting confidentiality, building rapport, and delivering intervention content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jails, like many community settings, are imperfect environments for fidelity in intervention delivery.  Yet the women who move through jails have extremely high health needs, and therefore bear the burden of significant physical and mental health disparities, making intervention delivery in these settings and for these populations highly necessary.  But delivery of interventions must be considered in the context of everyday realities and therefore realistic expectations for fidelity must be set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/07/24/balancing-expectation-and-reality-intervention-fidelity-trauma-and-women-with-histories-of-incarceration/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Balancing expectation and reality: intervention fidelity, trauma, and women with histories of incarceration&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic survey in the US of people’s beliefs about their own intelligence – the first for 50 years – has shown that was true then is also the case in the modern era: a majority of people think they are smarter than average.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Patrick Heck from the Geisinger Health System and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200103&quot;&gt;published in PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, combined an online survey and phone survey, with each involving 750 people reflecting a cross-section of the US population, balanced in terms of sex, age, education levels and race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both surveys, 65 per cent of participants agreed with the statement “I am more intelligent than the average person.” Around 70 per cent of men versus 60 per cent of women made the above-average claim, and a similar pattern was found in the young and old. There were also no clear racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research accords with both the half-century old study from the Russell Sage Foundation, and more recent research that suggests there is an overconfidence bias in the general population. The trouble is that most of the work following the Foundation’s study has often come from self-selecting or convenience samples that are unlikely to be representative of the wider population, or from students, who may be special cases, struggling, for instance, to envisage what the average person is like from their campus existence.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new surveys also validate another cornerstone of overconfidence research: that the least intelligent tend to be the most overconfident. While university graduates (who are typically one standard deviation higher than average in intelligence) collectively tended to slightly underestimate their intelligence, those participants whose highest qualification was a high school diploma collectively over-shot in estimating theirs. Heck’s team conclude “that American’s self-flattering beliefs about intelligence are alive and well several decades after their discovery was first reported.”&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: How the Brain Perceives Colors?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23848</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Color vision is the ability to distinguish different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. Color vision relies on a brain perception mechanism that treats light with different wavelengths as different visual stimuli (e.g., colors). Usual color insensitive photoreceptors (the rods in human eyes) only react to the presence or absence of light and do not distinguish between specific wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can argue that colors are not real—they are “synthesized” by our brain to distinguish light with different wavelengths. While rods give us the ability to detect the presence and intensity of light (and thus allow our brain to construct the picture of the world around us), specific detection of different wavelengths through independent channels gives our view of the world additional high resolution. For instance, red and green colors look like near identical shades of grey in black and white photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An animal with black and white vision alone won’t be able to make a distinction between, let’s say, a green and red apple, and won’t know which one tastes better before trying them both based on color. Evolutionary biologists believe that human ancestors developed color vision to facilitate the identification of ripe fruits, which would obviously provide an advantage in the competitive natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why certain wavelengths are paired with certain colors remains a mystery. Technically, color is an illusion created by our brain. Therefore, it is not clear if other animals see colors the same way we see them. It is likely that, due to shared evolutionary history, other vertebrates see the world colored similarly to how we see it. But color vision is quite common across the vast animal kingdom: insects, arachnids, and cephalopods are able to distinguish colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of colors do these animals see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human color vision relies on three photoreceptors that detect primary colors—red, green, and blue. However, some people lack red photoreceptors (they are “bichromates”) or have an additional photoreceptor that detects somewhere between red and green colors (“tetrachromates”). Obviously, having only 3 photoreceptors doesn’t limit our ability to distinguish other colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each photoreceptor can absorb a rather broad range of wavelengths of light. To distinguish a specific color, the brain compares and quantitatively analyses the data from all three photoreceptors. And our brain does this remarkably successfully—some research indicates that we can distinguish colors that correspond to wavelength differences of just 1 nanometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scheme works in largely the same way in most higher vertebrate animals that have color vision. Although the ability to distinguish between specific shades varies significantly between the species, with humans having one of the best color distinguishing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, invertebrates that have developed color vision (and vision in general) completely independently from us demonstrate remarkably different approaches to color detection and processing. These animals can have a exceptionally large number of color receptors. The mantis shrimp, for instance, has 12 different types of photoreceptors. The common bluebottle butterfly has even more—15 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it mean that these animals can see additional colors unimaginable to us? Perhaps yes. Some of their photoreceptors operate in a rather narrow region of light spectrum. For instance, they can have 4-5 photoreceptors sensitive in the green region of the visual spectrum. This means that for these animals the different shades of green may appear as different as blue and red colors appear to our eyes! Again, the evolutionary advantages of such adaptations are obvious for an animal living among the trees and grasses where most objects, as we see them, are colored in various shades of green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers tried to test if a more complicated set of visual receptors provide any advantages for animals when it comes to the distinguishing between main colors. The findings show that this is not necessarily the case, at least not for the mantis shrimp. Despite the impressive array of receptors detecting light in a much broader part of the electromagnetic spectrum compared to humans, the shrimp’s ability to distinguish between colors that great in comparison to us. However, they determine the colors fast. This is probably more important for practical purposes, as mantis shrimps are predators. A large number of photoreceptors allows for their quick activation at specific wavelengths of light and thus communicate directly to the brain what specific wavelength was detected. In comparison, humans have to assess and quantify the signals from all three photoreceptors to decide on a specific color. This requires more time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from employing a different number of photoreceptors to sense light of specific wavelengths, some animals can detect light that we humans are completely unable to see. For example, many birds and insects can see in the UV part of the spectrum. Bumblebees, for instance, have three photoreceptors absorbing in the UV, blue, and green regions of the spectrum. This makes them trichromates, like humans, but with the spectral sensitivity shifted to the blue end of the spectrum. The ability to detect UV light explains why some flowers have patterns visible only in this part of the spectrum. These patterns attract pollinating insects, which have an ability to see in this spectral region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of animals can detect infrared light (the long wavelength radiation) emitted by heated objects and bodies. This ability significantly facilitates hunting for snakes that are usually looking for small warm-blooded prey. Seeing them through IR detecting receptors is, thus, a great tool for slow-moving reptiles. The photoreceptors sensitive to IR radiation in snakes are located not in their eye but in “pit organs” located between the eyes and nostrils. The result is still the same: snakes can color objects according to their surface temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this brief article shows, we humans can see and analyze only a small portion of the visual information available to other creatures. Next time you see a humble fly, think about how different it perceives the same things you are both looking at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinicians treating teenagers with gender dysphoria, the teens themselves, and their parents, are faced with a dilemma – puberty suppressing drugs and hormonal treatments will likely make it easier for the adolescent to gender transition in due course, and the earlier that process begins, the more effective it is likely to be. However, intervening earlier comes with a greater risk that the teen may later de-transition (that is, change their mind about wanting to transition to the other gender), leaving them with potentially irreversible bodily changes caused by the hormonal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/141/4/e20173742&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, adding to this clinical dilemma is a dearth of quality data on the physical and psychosocial effects of hormonal treatments on gender dysphoric teenagers and young adults. The limited evidence that is available provides only “qualified support” for these treatments, the review concludes, and while puberty suppressors have some benefits, they do not actually alleviate gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34271&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings – based on an exhaustive search of any and all relevant studies published between 1946 and 2017 – are published at a time when the medical and allied professions have shifted toward an increasingly “affirmative” approach toward gender dysphoria, one that at the extreme involves encouraging the process of transition at the very first signs of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Psychological Society’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/rep_92.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 propose offering “a series of [five] staged treatments”, to give time for the young person to consider their options, beginning with psychological exploration and escalating, if the dysphoria persists, to the use of puberty suppressing hormones and culminating in surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of the Endocrine Society (an International body based in Washington DC) are more affirmative: “We suggest that clinicians begin pubertal hormone suppression after girls and boys [diagnosed with gender dysphoria] first exhibit physical changes of puberty”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the new review reveals how this advice is based on extremely limited evidence. When it comes to teens and young adults aged under 25, we simply do not yet know much about the psychosocial effects of pubertal suppressors (including gonadotropin-releasing analogs which suppress the development of secondary sexual characteristics) and hormonal treatments (both gender-affirming hormones and cross-hormonal treatments, such as anti-androgens, which counter the effects of testosterone, and progestins, which suppress the menses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Chew at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues identified only thirteen relevant studies, and most of these involved small samples, only two featured a control group, and none involved blinding or randomisation (the gold standard approach for medical trials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited evidence available suggests that these interventions are “relatively safe” in terms of their physical side-effects, although there is no long-term data (including potential adverse effects on fertility). Where short-term side-effects occur, these can include, among others, hot flushes, fatigue, weight gain and, most concerning, changes to bone mass density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puberty suppressors appear to be effective at having their intended physical effect – that is, preventing pubertal changes associated with the person’s sex assigned at birth. They also have emotional and behavioural benefits, such as reducing depression. Crucially, however, they do not alleviate gender dysphoria (one study even found a trend in the opposite direction and increased negative body image). The researchers said this is “probably not surprising” given that puberty suppressing drugs “cannot be expected to lessen the dislike of existing physical sex characteristics associated with an individual’s birth-assigned sex nor satisfy their desire for the physical sex characteristics of their preferred gender”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, gender affirming treatments and cross-hormonal treatments are successful, to a degree, in achieving the intended physical changes in line with the desired gender. However, these often do not match the hopes of the person with gender dysphoria – for instance, oestrogen led to a degree of breast growth that most of those treated found unsatisfactory. There are some cognitive effects to consider – for instance, after taking puberty suppressing drugs, teenagers born male but seeking to transition to female, subsequently showed poorer performance on tests of executive functioning and mental rotation. Perhaps most concerning – especially given &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/17/most-children-and-teens-with-gender-dysphoria-also-have-multiple-other-psychological-issues/&quot;&gt;the psychological vulnerability of many teens with gender dysphoria&lt;/a&gt; – there is simply no data on the psychosocial effects of these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of data is in the context of a growing concern among some psychologists that the affirmative approach may have gone too far. For example, psychologist Dianne Berg, Co-Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sexualhealth.umn.edu/national-center-gender-spectrum-health&quot;&gt;National Center for Gender Spectrum Health&lt;/a&gt; in the US (which advocates an affirmative approach), told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently “Under the motivation to be supportive and to be affirming and to be nonstigmatizing, I think the pendulum has swung so far that now we’re maybe not looking as critically at the issues as we should be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One critical issue that has yet to be addressed by research at all, is what the effects are of hormonal treatments on teens who later de-transition. As of now, Chew and her team say there are “no known studies to date in which researchers have reported the rates and circumstances under which transgender youth cease their hormonal therapy in an unplanned manner or the risk of subsequent regret.” While the researchers say their review provides “qualified support” for the use of puberty suppressors and hormonal treatments, they conclude that more better quality and long-term research is essential, including data on the psychological effects of these interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

As such, the latter say, the journals they publish would be better described as “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/osi2016-25/ZNes8t0yaAM/0wNCplDZAgAJ&quot;&gt;new wave journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” or examples of “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GinnyBarbour/status/1016921343101526016&quot;&gt;innovation in publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, not predatory journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/867/1041&quot;&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that any harm predatory publishers do is small and has been significantly overblown by the enemies of open access, or that the problem is “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/spotlight-on-the-oaspa-board-lars-bjornshauge/&quot;&gt;not as big now as it once was&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet others maintain that the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/pdf/aabc/2018nahead/0001-3765-aabc-201820170959.pdf&quot;&gt;real predators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt; of scholarly publishing are legacy subscription publishers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who have been &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist&quot;&gt;robbing the research community blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for years and are now &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;corrupting open science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These complexities point to a central problem in any discussion of predatory publishing: no one is able to adequately define (or agree on a definition of) the phenomenon. And yet however one defines it, it is clearly casting the research community in a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndr.de/der_ndr/presse/More-than-5000-German-scientists-have-published-papers-in-pseudo-scientific-journals,fakescience178.html&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/07/19/la-france-fait-partie-des-gros-contributeurs-aux-revues-scientifiques-douteuses_5333431_1650684.html&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-indias-fake-research-paper-shops-pay-publish-profit-5265402/&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Hugely controversial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever the truth (and likely predatory publishing is some mix of the above) the topic is a hugely controversial one and engenders bitter disputes. For instance, the person who coined the term predatory publisher –  &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Beall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – has been the recipient of a constant stream of verbal attacks and legal threats, not least because he created the foundational blacklist of what he calls “potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers”. Beall also regularly publishes articles (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/525/514&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in which he maintains that predatory publishing is a direct consequence of open access, and that OA has as a result &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.4open-sciences.org/articles/fopen/abs/2018/01/fopen180001s/fopen180001s.html&quot;&gt;thrown scholarly publishing into “crisis mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many were not surprised, therefore, when last year Beall’s site &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/&quot;&gt;disappeared overnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And shortly afterwards he &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;left his post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the University of Colorado without explanation (that I am aware of). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;b&gt;Update 22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;nd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt; July&lt;/b&gt;: On the same day I posted this an interview with Beall was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Indian Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in which he offered &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jeffrey-beall-american-librarian-predatory-publishers-threaten-scientific-integrity-are-embarrassment-to-india-5266858/&quot;&gt;his explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; as to why he left his job.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To add to the confusion, as concern grew, and both blacklists (e.g. Beall’s list, now &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;Cabells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and whitelists (e.g. the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doaj.org/&quot;&gt;Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) began to appear, a new problem emerged: even if an OA publisher tries to be honest and straightforward and has the papers submitted to it assessed in a diligent manner, it may at any point (and for whatever reason) be deemed by the community to be predatory. As a result, all those researchers who have published with it can expect to suffer reputational damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given these complexities, I plan to use the term predatory publishing in this article in a very specific way. I will be referring to those OA publishers who clearly and deliberately trick researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;– essentially, by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;failing to provide the promised (or even a meaningful) service and/or deceiving them about the nature of that service, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;simply in order to extract money from them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will not name any publishers, or journals, but simply refer to some of the deceptive practices they engage in that I know take place. I know they take place because I am regularly contacted by the victims of such unethical behaviour, and these victims share with me the details of what has happened to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, for instance, the publishers/journals I am talking about often do not inform authors at the point of submission that they will be charged an APC if their paper is accepted. And they often tell them (or imply) that the papers they publish are properly peer-reviewed where in reality they are not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s true, there are also some dishonest researchers who deliberately seek out predatory publishers in order to bulk up their CVs. Nevertheless, I have been contacted by a sufficiently large number of scholars who have been tricked by unscrupulous OA publishers that I am confident there is a serious problem out there. And it leads me to believe that a great many of the researchers who publish in these journals are hapless victims of a scam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my view, predatory publishing (or whatever you choose to call it) is a serious problem and a solution will eventually have to be found. Here, however, I am concerned primarily with the victims of predatory publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The consequences can be serious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When authors fall victim to a predatory publisher the consequences can be serious. Not only will they be conned into handing over (usually public) money for a service that is never (or very inadequately) provided, but (more seriously for them) their reputation (and likely their career) may be negatively impacted as a result. Unsurprisingly, therefore, victims of predatory publishers experience a great deal of anguish, anger and resentment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What surprises me is that while no one can agree on what predatory publishing is, or how prevalent or damaging it is, there nevertheless appears to be a consensus that if anyone falls victim to one of these publishers they have only themselves to blame. In other words, it is viewed as an individual failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, I view predatory publishing as a community problem. And, as such, I believe the community has a responsibility to come up with a solution for those researchers who become victims. After all, as I &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/09/predatory-publishing-modest-proposal.html&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; three years ago, predatory publishing could not exist without the co-operation of the research community – e.g. by universities and funders encouraging researchers to engage in pay-to-publish gold OA, and by (often senior) researchers agreeing to join the editorial boards of journals they know little or nothing about, in which they are unlikely ever to publish themselves, and for which they will probably never do any reviewing or editorial work. (Yes, I know, some researchers say they are listed on EBs without having opted-in, but many clearly do volunteer, if only because it adds another line to their CVs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To my mind, the community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s apparent lack of concern for the victims of predatory publishing represents a moral failure on its part. Certainly, that was the conclusion I reached recently when – during the same week – I was contacted by two different researchers from two different continents (neither, by the way, were from the global South, which is commonly said to be where most victims of predatory publishing are based).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In both cases, the researchers (and their co-authors) had inadvertently submitted papers to predatory publishers. As a result, both had quickly discovered that if you mistakenly submit a paper to a predatory publisher it can be difficult to extricate yourself from what is inevitably a distressing situation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is difficult because the victims of a predatory publisher are likely to discover what has happened only after their paper has been published, or when they receive an invoice (for sometimes thousands of dollars) with a demand that they pay up ASAP. The realisation that they have been conned will, of course, make them angry. But the more distressing moment comes when they realise that their name and reputation are now forever linked to a predatory publisher – unless they can persuade the publisher to take their paper down again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first researcher who contacted me realised something had gone wrong when the manuscript that he and his co-authors had submitted was returned to them with no peer review reports attached and no suggested changes. There was, however, a note to say that it had been accepted, and could they please pay the attached invoice. They later learned that the paper had already been published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quickly realising what had happened, and desperate to recover the situation, the authors agreed to pay the publisher the journal’s full APC (over $2,000) – not for publishing their paper, but for taking it down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even then, they discovered that several copies of the paper had been posted on the publisher’s site and one was still publicly available. In addition, copies (with the publisher’s name attached) were proliferating across the Web, including on a number of paper sharing sites (Oh the joys of CC BY!). They had emailed me in the hope that I could offer some advice, and perhaps approach the publisher on their behalf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second author who contacted me had likewise realised that he and his co-authors had submitted their latest paper to a predatory journal. And even though they refused to pay the publication fee, their paper was published. In addition, they discovered that the publisher was seeking to get it indexed on &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/&quot;&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Since the journal in question is listed in PubMed, as are a number of the publisher’s other journals, this was a real possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately, after I became involved the first paper was fully removed from the publisher’s web site, and the second one had a retraction notice attached to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, I know these things go on because over the past 7 years I have had many researchers like these contact me with tales of the nefarious deeds that predatory publishers engage in. Interestingly, sometimes they turn to me only after their university’s counsel has failed to resolve the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have always been happy to try and help, but I have also always been aware that even though I am often able to resolve the situation, I cannot provide a scalable solution. It is a time-consuming process and I am just one person working on their own. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is one reason why I believe a community solution is essential, but it is certainly not the most compelling one. The more important reason is that since it is the wider research community that has created the monster that predatory publishing has become the community has a responsibility to help the victims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Aside from the fact that many members of this community are willing to sit on the editorial boards of predatory journals, the community supports and promotes the pay-to-publish business model that created the conditions for predatory publishing. And when the problem became apparent the community either denied there was a problem or simply sat on its hands and allowed the problem to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But who should organise a community solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One organisation that could surely play a useful role is the Committee on Publication Ethics (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/&quot;&gt;COPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). This is an organisation, after all, that says it is “committed to educate and support editors, publishers and those involved in publication ethics with the aim of moving the culture of publishing towards one where ethical practices becomes the norm, part of the publishing culture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As it happens I discovered last year that in 2016 COPE published a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/case/withdrawal-accepted-manuscript-predatory-journal&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; exemplifying the kind of deceptive practices predatory publishers engage in, and in which it mooted a solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The COPE case study points out that because, as a rule, predatory publishers do not ask for copyright to be assigned to them, authors are able to demand that their paper is taken down. Once they have done that, the case study adds, they can then resubmit the paper to a “legitimate journal” with an editorial note explaining what had happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPE goes on to explain how the author highlighted in the case study wrote to the predatory journal that had tricked her to say, “Immediately remove my article from your website. If you do not do so immediately, I will take legal action”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the publisher asked for the name of the article and the journal in which it had been published, the author provided the information and repeated that she would proceed with legal action if the article was not removed from the journal’s website by a given date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The case study concludes by saying that the author, “will now proceed with submission to a legitimate journal, and the editor of the legitimate journal is comfortable that duplicate publication is no longer a problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leaving aside the fact that predatory publishers are routinely robbing the public purse, this might, at first sight, seem a practical solution for victims. After all, the sole objective of a predatory publisher is to make money, not “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/career-advice-article/tips-to-avoid-predatory-journals-and-conferences/&quot;&gt;to advance knowledge and share new scientific and research findings following an established and rigorous peer review process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. Having been paid an APC, the publisher will have achieved that objective. And if an author refuses to pay up the publisher can hold the paper hostage until a withdrawal fee is paid. Ironically, the worse the publisher’s reputation the more leverage it has in demanding a high withdrawal fee since the more desperate researchers will be to dissociate themselves from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, having a predatory publisher take down a captured paper only solves half the problem for the victim; in order to recover the situation the author also needs to find an alternative journal willing to republish it. The case study might seem to imply that this is a formality. But is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Curious to find out, I suggested to one of the researchers who contacted me that he try the method proposed in the COPE case study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;“Your current submission cannot be considered further”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks later the author reported back to say that he had sent his paper to a widely recognised OA publisher, and had received the following reply: “Unfortunately, once a paper has been formally published anywhere, even in a predatory journal without the author’s agreement, it still counts as a double submission and therefore your current submission cannot be considered further by us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the problem may have been that the author contacted the legitimate journal before his paper had been removed from the predatory journal. Nevertheless, if the editor who replied had read the COPE case study (and accepted its argument) a more helpful reply would surely have gone along the lines of, “I am sorry to hear that this has happened to you. Can I suggest you ask the predatory publisher to take down your paper? Once that has been done I would be happy to consider sending it out for review.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, I emailed the editor and copied in COPE. I referred to the case study and asked whether the publisher of the journal was a member of COPE. I also asked why the editor seemed unwilling to help authors who have fallen victim to a predatory publisher (in contrast to the publisher in the COPE case study).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The editor replied that the publisher he represented was indeed a member of COPE and “follows COPE guidelines in dealing with cases of publication ethics.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added, however, “the COPE advice to which you refer was given at a COPE forum in response to a specific case submitted by a member and reflects the discussion at that forum. This advice is not necessarily applicable to other cases, as stated on COPE’s website”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, this did not seem to be a very helpful response. Sadly, however, when COPE replied it simply echoed the journal editor. “The intention behind posting Forum case discussions is to provide a guide on how to manage a similar case, but we do note that advice on a specific case may not necessarily be applicable to other, even similar, cases. COPE attempts to reflect all of the discussion of that case when we post Forum case discussions online which, quite often, present and explore opposing opinions and viewpoints. We’d advise anyone reflecting on records of cases discussed at COPE Forum to consider all the points of discussion noted to see whether it is applicable to their own case.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Personally, I could see no difference between the situation I had contacted COPE about and the situation described in the case study, but it is possible I am not privy to all the facts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I responded by asking to be pointed to COPE’s advice to editors and publishers on how to deal with situations like the one discussed in the case study. To this COPE replied, “COPE is a founding partner and active participant of the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkchecksubmit.org/&quot;&gt;Think.Check.Submit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; campaign and we actively support and promote that initiative when responding to the conversation around predatory publishing.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, that did not answer my question. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPE also sent me a copy of a report it had published and helpfully highlighted for me areas in the report that discussed predatory publishing. Again, however, this was a discussion of the issues of predatory publishing, not practical advice to editors and publishers on what to do when a victim approaches them looking for a legitimate home for their paper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What continues to puzzle me,” I replied, “is that COPE appears to have no published policy or advice for editors or journals on what to do when a researcher finds him/herself in the position outlined in your case study (which you say is not advice). I am sure the Think. Check. Submit idea is a good one, but it is of no use whatsoever for researchers who have been (for whatever reason) entrapped by a predatory publisher.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I added, “Does COPE really not intend to publish specific advice on what editors/ journals/ publishers should do in this situation, which I know is very common because many authors contact me who find themselves in it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also copied the journal editor into the email and informed him that I had been in contact with the predatory publisher, who said he was going to take down the paper from his site. Would the editor be willing to reconsider the paper once it had been taken down?, I asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Beginning the dialogue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The editor replied, “I am unable to discuss individual manuscripts with anyone who is not an author on the manuscript, therefore I cannot comment on the specifics of this case. However, in light of this information, we will be reaching out to the authors to investigate further.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shortly afterwards, the author who had asked for my help emailed me to say that the publisher had agreed to reconsider a revised submission of his paper “on a semi-urgent basis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Separately, COPE emailed me to say, “COPE recently held its biannual meeting where this issue was raised and discussed further. It has been agreed to consider what advice COPE can provide in these circumstances and we are beginning the dialogue with our members to decide how best to approach the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is hard not to feel that such a dialogue should have begun long ago, but better late than never perhaps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With luck, COPE will eventually fashion a solution, or at least &lt;i&gt;publish some advice&lt;/i&gt; for editors and journals, if only to encourage them to treat the victims of predatory publishing with more sympathy than they currently experience.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From a selfish point of view, it would certainly be useful if every time a researcher contacted me for assistance and/or advice I could point them to the COPE web site for the help they need. If nothing else this could avoid my having to spend my time emailing publishers on behalf of individuals whom (so far as I can see) no one else currently seems willing to help. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A community solution would also be timely as I am finding it increasingly difficult to get the attention of predatory publishers – I assume because they are having to put more and more effort into handling complaints from their victims!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What frustrates me is that people are happy to rail against predatory publishers, to argue over whether blacklists or whitelists are preferable, or to dismiss predatory publishing as no more than an anti-OA slur, but they continue to insist that the victims are the authors of their own fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, my view is that the wider research community should not be leaving these people hanging in the wind but helping them. After all, it is a wind that the community set in motion the day it embraced and promoted pay-to-publish gold OA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also find it somewhat high-minded and hypocritical for publishers to parrot &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;Think.Check.Submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; every time the topic of predatory publishing comes up. How many researchers know about this initiative? Of those who do, how many can say that using it prevented them from being stung, or that its advice is as useful as claimed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting, for instance, that the Think.Check.Submit site says that one sign of a journal’s legitimacy is if it is “indexed in services that you use”. As I noted, one of the journals I was approached about recently is listed in PubMed. Indeed, it would appear that other predatory journals are still listed in PubMed too, as may be the case with DOAJ (despite it having &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/open-access-index-delists-thousands-of-journals-1.19871&quot;&gt;delisted thousands of predatory journals from its service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2016). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As further evidence of how difficult it is to navigate the world of predatory publishing, we could note that the University Grants Commission (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ugc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;UGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in India has &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journosdiary.com/2017/09/05/india-ugc-white-list-predatory-journals/&quot;&gt;struggled to weed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predatory journals from its whitelist of approved journals.

As such, it is a half-solution at best. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clearly more needs to be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The COPE case study suggests one possible way forward. However, its solution requires more work than should surely be necessary. More importantly, it requires the co-operation of the scammers, making it a morally suspect solution, and a somewhat fragile one at that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surely there is a better way? I think so. Earlier this year, for instance, it was &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AJOLinfo/status/1001751743099785216?s=19&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Twitter that papers captured by predatory journals “could be published a second time in [a] legitimate journal once [a] scam [has been] proven, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crossref.org/&quot;&gt;CrossRef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could consider changing the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doi.org/&quot;&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the legit later one.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The appeal of this approach is that there would be no need to go through the time-consuming and painful process of persuading predatory publishers to take down papers, or in fact to engage with them at all. As I understand it, the idea is that an appeal would be made to, say, CrossRef or COPE, and if that appeal was successful the paper could be republished in a legitimate journal, at which point the article DOI would be re-assigned to the version published in the latter version. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Such a solution would be another timely development since both the research community and publishers are currently grappling with the issue of versioning in the online environment, particularly as the preprint movement gathers pace (see &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/biorxiv-a-postprint-server-944359ac65d4&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for instance, and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/the-preprint-dilemma-good-for-science-bad-for-the-public-a-discussion-paper-for-the-scientific-community&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The point is that there is only ever one “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;version of record&lt;/span&gt;” (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/questions/article-versions/&quot;&gt;VoR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and (as I understand it) this is signalled by means of its DOI. In the case of predatory publishing, therefore, presumably the DOI could (as suggested on Twitter) be re-assigned to the VoR and the predatory publisher’s version left to fester. Perhaps the DOI assigned to the predatory version could even be deactivated or turned off in some way, leaving it to wallow in relative obscurity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I am no expert in these matters and no doubt more thought would need to be given to the matter by wiser heads than mine. Either way, the DOI, CrossRef and COPE would seem to me to be essential partners in any solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let us hope that COPE will indeed take this forward and finally begin to offer hope to those isolated and lonely individuals who discover they have been conned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These people are the collateral damage of the pay-to-publish business model devised and promulgated by influential publishers like PLOS and BMC and subsequently endorsed and promoted by the research community. It’s time for the community to hold out a helping hand to the victims of predatory pubishing. If it cannot do this I do not think it can justifiably call itself a community any longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Brain Blogger: Is Social Media the Bad Guy? Redefining Beauty in a Digital World</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23831</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/07/20/is-social-media-the-bad-guy-redefining-beauty-in-a-digital-world/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re living in an age of hyper-connectivity where social media is being widely used by almost every age group in the world. It’s connected people from all corners of the planet and given us the opportunity to have global conversations about practically any subject, event, or news piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many mental health and behavioral experts believe that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/&quot;&gt;social media has had a negative impact on the psychological well-being&lt;/a&gt; of those who use it because it gives people the illusion of being popular based solely on how many “likes” and “friends” they have on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have also observed that social media exacerbates the tendency for frequent users to develop a skewed impression of the world which is seldom accurate or healthy. Young girls and women, for example, may develop unrealistic standards when it comes to their looks and bodies based on what they see on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of labeling social media as the bad guy, I see it as a double-edged sword. The eventual effect that it has on your life really comes down to how you use it and for what purpose. The Internet is a neutral and open platform that levels the playing field when it comes to having access to knowledge that could help us live healthier, productive, and more fulfilling lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to avoid the negative impact that social media could have on her self-image, they need to become more conscious of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/20/digital-dieting-to-prevent-life-destroying-internet-addiction/&quot;&gt;media diet&lt;/a&gt;. If they follow social media accounts and blogs run by people and institutions that are shallow and appearance-focused, such as Instagram models and celebrity fashion and gossip related profiles, it can hurt them if they aren’t mindful of its probable impact on them, especially on a subconscious level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative impact of social media can be avoided if people are guided towards adopting a more empowering and all-encompassing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/02/07/beauty-is-in-the-brain-of-the-beholder/&quot;&gt;standard of beauty&lt;/a&gt; which includes all aspects of being—intellect, aspirations, passions, talents and her morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, they will be naturally drawn towards developing an identity that isn’t solely based on outward appearances but on character—this, in turn, will influence the use of social media for noble purposes that will expand the mind and provide a platform to express creative potential and to make a difference. In other words, we need to take an inside-out approach when it comes to combating the potentially harmful effects of social media, or any other forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: Revues prédatrices : quel est le problème ?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1522</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/revues-predatrices-quel-est-le-probleme/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Un &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/07/19/alerte-mondiale-a-la-fausse-science_5333374_1650684.html&quot;&gt;récent article du Monde&lt;/a&gt; alerte sur un phénomène qui prend de l’ampleur dans l’édition scientifique : les revues prédatrices (voir aussi l’&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/07/19/la-gangrene-de-la-fausse-science_5333560_3232.html&quot;&gt;éditorial&lt;/a&gt;). Il s’agit d’éditeurs commerciaux qui publient des articles scientifiques en ligne, contre rémunération, sans aucune éthique scientifique, en particulier en acceptant tous les articles sans qu’ils soient revus par des pairs. De manière similaire, les &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/07/19/le-business-juteux-des-simili-conferences-scientifiques_5333429_1650684.html&quot;&gt;fausses conférences&lt;/a&gt; se multiplient ; des entreprises organisent des conférences scientifiques dans un but purement commercial, sans se soucier de la qualité scientifique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En réaction, certaines institutions commencent à monter des « listes blanches » de journaux à éviter. C’est compréhensible, puisque le phénomène a un coût important. Mais la réponse néglige le problème fondamental. Il faut se rendre à l’évidence : l’éthique commerciale (recherche du profit) n’est pas compatible avec l’éthique scientifique (recherche de la vérité). Les entreprises dont on parle ne sont pas illégales, à ma connaissance. Elles organisent des conférences qui sont réelles ; elles publient des journaux qui sont réels. Simplement, elles ne se soucient pas de la qualité scientifique, mais de leur profit. On considère cela comme immoral ; mais une entreprise commerciale n’a pas de dimension morale, il s’agit simplement d’une organisation dont le but est de générer du profit. On ne peut s’attendre à ce que les intérêts commerciaux correspondent comme par magie exactement aux intérêts scientifiques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; Le problème de l’édition commerciale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceci est vrai aux deux extrémités du spectre de la publication académique : pour les journaux prédateurs comme pour les journaux prestigieux. L’article parle de « fausse science » ; mais la plupart des cas de fraude scientifique ont été révélés dans des journaux prestigieux, pas dans des journaux prédateurs – qui de toutes façons ne sont pas lus par la communauté scientifique (voir par exemple &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037&quot;&gt;Brembs (2018)&lt;/a&gt; pour le lien entre qualité méthodologique et prestige du journal). Pour les journaux commerciaux prestigieux, la stratégie commerciale des éditeurs est non pas de maximiser le nombre d’articles publiés, mais de maximiser le prestige perçu de ces journaux, qui servent ensuite d’appâts pour vendre les collections de journaux de l’éditeur. Autrement dit, c’est une stratégie de marque. Cela passe notamment par une sélection drastique des articles soumis, opérée par des éditeurs professionnels, c’est-à-dire pas par des scientifiques professionnels, sur la base de l’importance perçue des résultats, poussant ainsi une génération de scientifiques à gonfler les prétentions de leurs articles. Cela passe par la promotion auprès des institutions publiques de métriques douteuses comme le facteur d’impact, et plus généralement la promotion d’une mythologie de la publication prestigieuse, à savoir l’idée fausse et dangereuse qu’un article doit être jugé par le prestige du journal dans lequel il est publié, plutôt que par sa valeur scientifique intrinsèque – qui elle est évaluée par la communauté scientifique, pas par un éditeur commercial, ni même par deux scientifiques anonymes. En proposant d’éditer des listes de mauvais journaux, on ne résout pas le problème car l’on adhère implicitement à cette logique perverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il suffit de regarder les marges dégagées par les grandes multinationales de l’édition scientifique pour comprendre que le modèle commercial n’est pas adapté. Pour Elsevier par exemple, les marges sont de l’ordre de 40%. La simple lecture de ce chiffre devrait nous convaincre immédiatement que l’édition scientifique devrait être gérée par des institutions publiques, du moins non commerciales (par exemple des sociétés savantes, comme c’est le cas d’un certain nombre de journaux). Quel est la justification pour faire appel à un opérateur commercial pour gérer un service public, ou n’importe quel service ? La motivation est que la compétition permet de diminuer les coûts et d’améliorer la qualité. Or si les marges sont de 40%, c’est que visiblement la compétition n’opère pas. Pourquoi ? Simplement parce que lorsqu’un scientifique soumet un article, il ne choisit pas le journal en fonction du prix ni même du service rendu (qui est en réalité essentiellement rendu par des scientifiques bénévoles), mais en fonction de la visibilité et du prestige du journal. Il n’y a donc pas de compétition sur les prix. Le pire qui pourrait arriver pour un éditeur commercial est que les articles scientifiques soient jugés à leur valeur intrinsèque plutôt que par le journal dans lequel ils sont publiés, parce qu’alors ce modèle commercial unique s’effondrerait et les journaux seraient en compétition sur les prix et les services qu’ils doivent fournir, comme n’importe quelle autre entreprise commerciale. C’est le pire qui puisse arriver aux éditeurs commerciaux, et le mieux qui puisse arriver à la communauté scientifique. Voilà pourquoi les intérêts commerciaux et scientifiques sont divergents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoi qu’il en soit, il faut se rendre à l’évidence : des marges aussi énormes signifient que le modèle commercial est inefficace. Il faut donc cesser immédiatement de faire appel à des journaux commerciaux. Ce n’est pas très difficile : les institutions publiques sont tout à fait capables de gérer des journaux scientifiques ; il en existe et depuis longtemps. Un exemple récent est &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/&quot;&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt;, un des journaux les plus innovants actuellement en biologie. Cela ne devrait pas être très étonnant : le cœur de l’activité des journaux, à savoir la relecture des articles, est déjà faite par des scientifiques, y compris chez les éditeurs commerciaux qui font appel à leurs services gratuitement. Cela ne veut pas dire que l’on ne peut pas faire appel à des entreprises privées pour fournir des services, par exemple héberger des serveurs, gérer les sites web, fournir de l’infrastructure. Mais les journaux ne doivent plus appartenir à des sociétés commerciales, dont l’intérêt est de gérer ces journaux comme des marques. L’éthique scientifique n’est pas compatible avec l’éthique commerciale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment faire ? En réalité c'est assez évident. Il s’agit pour les pouvoirs publics d’annuler la totalité des abonnements aux éditeurs commerciaux et de cesser de payer des droits de publication à ces éditeurs. De nos jours, il n’est pas difficile d’avoir accès à la littérature scientifique sans passer par les journaux (par les prépublications ou ‘preprints’ ou simplement en écrivant aux auteurs qui sont généralement ravis que l’on s’intéresse à leurs travaux). L’argent économisé peut être réinvesti en partie dans l’édition scientifique non commerciale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; Le mythe de la revue par les pairs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je veux maintenant en venir à une question d’épistémologie plus subtile mais fondamentale. Quel est au fond le problème des revues prédatrices ? Clairement, il y a le gaspillage d’argent public. Mais l’article du Monde pointe également des problèmes scientifiques, à savoir le fait que de fausses informations sont propagées, sans avoir été vérifiées. L’éditorial parle en effet de ‘la sacro-sainte « revue par les pairs »’, qui n’est pas effectuée par ces revues. Mais est-ce vraiment le problème fondamental ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’idée que ce qui fait la valeur d’un article scientifique est qu’il a été validé par la relecture par les pairs avant publication est un mythe tenace mais néanmoins erroné. Cela est faux d’un point de vue empirique, et d’un point de vue théorique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’un point de vue empirique, à tout instant, il existe dans la littérature des conclusions contradictoires à propos d’un grand nombre de sujets, publiées dans des revues traditionnelles. Les cas de fraude récents concernent des articles qui ont pourtant subi une relecture par les pairs. Mais c’est le cas aussi d’une quantité beaucoup plus importantes d’articles non frauduleux, mais dont les conclusions ont été contestées par la suite. L’histoire des sciences est remplie de théories scientifiques contradictoires et coexistantes, d’âpres débats entre scientifiques. Ces débats ont lieu, justement, après publication, et le consensus scientifique se forme généralement assez lentement, pratiquement jamais sur la base d’un seul article (voir par exemple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos#Research_programmes&quot;&gt;Imre Lakatos&lt;/a&gt; en philosophie des sciences, ou &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions&quot;&gt;Thomas Kuhn&lt;/a&gt;). Par ailleurs, les résultats scientifiques sont également souvent diffusés dans la communauté scientifique avant publication formelle ; c’est le cas aujourd’hui avec les prépublications (« preprints » en ligne), mais c’était déjà partiellement le cas auparavant avec les conférences. L’article publié reste la référence parce qu’il fournit des détails précis, notamment méthodologiques, mais la contribution des relecteurs sollicités par les journaux n’est dans la plupart des cas pas essentielle, d’autant que celle-ci n’est généralement pas rendue publique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’un point de vue théorique, il n’y a aucune raison que la relecture par les pairs « valide » un résultat scientifique. Il n’y a rien de magique dans la revue par les pairs : simplement deux, parfois trois scientifiques donnent leur avis éclairé sur le manuscrit. Ces scientifiques ne sont pas plus experts que ceux qui vont lire l’article lorsqu’il sera publié (je parle bien sûr de la communauté scientifique et pas du grand public). Le fait qu’un article soit publié dans un journal ne dit pas grand chose en soi de la réception des résultats par la communauté ; lorsqu’un article est rejeté d’un journal, il est resoumis ailleurs. La publication finale n’atteste absolument pas d’un consensus scientifique. Par ailleurs, lorsqu’il s’agit d’études empiriques, les relecteurs n’ont pas en réalité la possibilité de vérifier les résultats, et notamment de vérifier s’il n’y a pas eu de fraude. Tout ce qu’ils peuvent faire, c’est vérifier que les méthodes employées semblent appropriées, et que les interprétations semblent sensées (deux points souvent sujets à débat). Pour valider les résultats (mais pas les interprétations), il faudrait au minimum pouvoir refaire les expériences en question, ce qui suppose le temps et l’équipement nécessaire. Ce travail indispensable est fait (ou tenté), mais il n’est pas fait au moment de la publication, ni commissionné par le journal. Il est fait après publication par la communauté scientifique. Le travail de « vérification » (mot inapproprié car il n’y a pas de vérité absolue en science, ce qui la distingue justement de la religion) est le travail de fond de la communauté scientifique, ce n’est pas le travail ponctuel du journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’est cette idée reçue qu’il faut déconstruire : que le travail de revue interne au journal « valide » d’une certaine manière les résultats scientifiques. Ce n’est pas le cas, cela n’a jamais été le cas, et cela ne peut pas être le cas. La validation scientifique est la nature même de l’entreprise scientifique, qui est un travail collectif et de longue haleine. On ne peut pas lire un article et conclure « c’est vrai »; il faut pour cela l’intégrer dans un ensemble de connaissances scientifiques, confronter l’interprétation à des points de vue différents (car toute interprétation requiert un cadre théorique).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’est justement cette idée reçue que les journaux prestigieux tentent au contraire de consolider. Il faut y résister. L’antidote est de rendre public et transparent le débat scientifique, qui actuellement reste souvent confiné aux couloirs des laboratoires et des conférences. On prétend que la relecture par les pairs valide les résultats scientifiques, mais ces rapports ne sont la plupart du temps pas publiés ; et quid des rapports non publiés lorsque l’article est rejeté par un journal ? Comment savoir alors ce qu’en pense la communauté ? Il faut au contraire rendre public le débat scientifique. C’est par exemple l’ambition de sites comme &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, qui a mis à jour un certain nombre de fraudes, mais qui peut être utilisé simplement pour le débat scientifique de manière générale. Plutôt que de conditionner la publication à un accord confidentiel de scientifiques anonymes, il faut au contraire inverser ce système : publier l’article (c’est en fait déjà le cas par la prépublication), puis solliciter les avis de la communauté, qui seront également publiés, argumentés, discutés par les auteurs et le reste de la communauté. C’est ainsi que les scientifiques, mais également le plus grand public, pourront obtenir un vision plus juste de la valeur scientifique des articles publiés. La revue par les pairs est un principe fondamental de la science, oui, mais pas celle effectuée dans la confidence par les journaux, celle au contraire effectuée au grand jour et sans limite de temps par la communauté scientifique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What makes for a good life? Current psychological theory highlights the importance of relationships, belonging and having a sense of purpose. Gratitude, forgiveness, generosity and self-compassion often get a mention too. According to a team of psychologists at George Mason University, there is however a glaring omission. Sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In theoretical models of well-being, sex is rarely discussed and in many seminal articles, ignored,” they write in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25711-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Kashdan and his colleagues have attempted to correct this oversight with a three-week diary study, in which they looked at the associations between sex frequency and quality and not only positive mood, but also sense of meaning in life. “If an individual gains sexual access to a romantic partner, this should raise momentary affect … and increase one’s sense of self-worth or meaning in life,” they predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34303&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-hundred and fifty-two college students (116 women; average age 24; 63 per cent in a monogamous romantic relationship) completed a diary each night for three weeks, in which they recorded their positive and negative moods that day, how meaningful their life felt, and any sexual activity they’d had since the last entry (this was interpreted broadly, from passionate kissing to intercourse), including how pleasurable and intimate it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous survey research has found that people who report having more sex also report being happier, but most of this evidence is based on cross-sectional data so it’s not clear if sex really makes people happy or if being happy encourages sex. With their methodology, Kashdan and his team were able to unravel cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that having sex on one day was associated with more positive mood states the following day, and also a greater feeling that life is meaningful (the converse wasn’t true – positive moods or more meaning in life one day was not associated with more sex the next). The overall pattern of findings were the same for men and women. Explaining their findings, the researchers said that “Meaning in life often arises when an individual feels their basic need for belonging is met with someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the nature of the sexual experience, greater sexual pleasure, but not greater intimacy, was associated with better mood the next day. Kashdan’s team said this adds to growing evidence “… that often hedonic pleasures and motives are as important to cultivating a good life as deep, meaningful or virtuous activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether participants were in a relationship or not didn’t make too much difference to the findings. What mattered more was whether they described their relationship as more intimate – if they did, the association between sex and next-day well-being gains was stronger.  The researchers interpreted this as suggesting that “simply being in a committed relationship is insufficient to derive benefits from pleasurable activities”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only fly in the ointment for the well-being benefits of sex was that, specifically for participants who had only been in their current relationship for a short time, sex on one day was associated with more negative mood states the next. This could be a “regression to the mean”, the researchers suggested, because people in a new relationship are likely to show more daily reactivity – “on the day they had sex, negative affect is probably lower and the change to the next day is greater”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is limited by its reliance on college students whose relationships, sex lives and life experiences are bound to be different than for middle-aged and older people. Also, while the three-week diary design has advantages over cross-sectional surveys, it still provides only a narrow snapshot of a person’s life. Nonetheless, Kashdan and his team believe their study makes an important contribution. “To understand the full scope of human flourishing, research on well-being needs to incorporate more rigorous scientific inquiries of sexual behaviour,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25711-001&quot;&gt;Sexuality leads to boosts in mood and meaning in life with no evidence for the reverse direction: A daily diary investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXII) The problem of biological measurement (2)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1519</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxii-the-problem-of-biological-measurement-2/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxi-the-problem-of-biological-measurement-1/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I have pointed out differences between biological sensing and physical measurement. A direct consequence is that it is not so straightforward to apply the framework of control theory to biological systems. At the level of behavior, it seems clear that animal behavior involves control; it is quite documented in the case of motor control. But this is the perspective of an external observer: the target value, the actual value and the error criterion are identified with physical measurements by an external observer. But how does the organism achieve this control, from its own perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the organism does not do, at least not directly, is measure the physical dimension and compare it to a target value. Rather, the biological system is influenced by the physical signal and reacts in a way that makes the physical dimension closer to a target value. How? I do not have a definite answer to this question, but I will explore a few possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us first explore a conventional possibility. The sensory neuron encodes the sensory input (eg muscle stretch) in some way; the control system decodes it, and then compares it to a target value. So for example, let us say that the sensory neuron is an integrate-and-fire neuron. If the input is constant, then the interspike interval can be mapped back to the input value. If the input is not constant, it is more complicated but estimates are possible. There are various studies relevant to this problem (for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231204000177&quot;&gt;Lazar (2004)&lt;/a&gt;; see also the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258&quot;&gt;Sophie Denève, e.g. 2013&lt;/a&gt;). But all these solutions require knowing quite precisely how the input has been encoded. Suppose for example that the sensory neuron adapts with some time constant. Then the decoder needs somehow to de-adapt. But to do it correctly, one needs to know the time constant accurately enough, otherwise biases are introduced. If we consider that the encoder itself learns, e.g. by adapting to signal statistics (as in the efficient coding hypothesis), then the properties of the encoder must be considered unknown by the decoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can the decoder learn to decode the sensory spikes? The problem is it does not have access to the original signal. The key question then is: what could the error criterion be? If the system has no access to the original signal but only streams of spikes, then how could it evaluate an error? One idea is to make an assumption about some properties of the original signal. One could for example assume that the original signal varies slowly, in contrast with the spike train, which is a highly fluctuating signal. Thus we may look for a slow reconstruction of the signal from the spike train; this is in essence the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Slow_feature_analysis&quot;&gt;slow feature analysis&lt;/a&gt;. But the original signal might not be slowly fluctuating, as it is influenced by the actions of the controller, so it is not clear that this criterion will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it is not so easy to think of a control system which would decode the sensory neuron activity into the original signal so as to compare it to a target value. But beyond this technical issue (how to learn the decoder), there is a more fundamental question: why splitting the work into two units (encoder/decoder), if the function of the second one is essentially to undo the work of the first one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to examine the system as a whole. We consider the physical system (environment), the sensory neuron, the actuator, and the interneurons (corresponding to the control system). Instead of seeing the sensory neuron as involved in an act of measurement and communication and the interneurons as involved in an act of interpretation and command, we see the entire system as a distributed dynamical system with a number of structural parameters. In terms of dynamical systems (rather than control), the question becomes: is the target value for the physical dimension an attractive fixed point of this system, or more generally, is there such a fixed point? (as opposed to fluctuations) We can then derive complementary questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;robustness: is the fixed point robust to perturbations, for example changes in properties of the sensor, actuator or environment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimality: are there ways to adjust the structure of the system so that the firing rate is minimized (for example)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;control: can we change the fixed point by an intervention on this system? (e.g. on the interneurons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the problem becomes one of designing a spiking system that has an attractive fixed point in the physical dimension, with some desirable properties. Framing the problem in this way does not necessarily require that the physical dimension is explicitly extracted (“decoded”) from the activity of the sensory neuron. If we look at such a system, we might not be able to identify in any of the neurons a quantity that corresponds to the physical signal, or to the target value. Rather, physical signal and target value are to be found in the physical environment, and it is a property of the coupled dynamical system (neurons-environment) that the physical signal tends to approach the target value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/feature-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a global threat and it is one of the risk factors associated with diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. It is a growing problem among women in Malaysia and other Asian countries, where the prevalence of obesity among women is much higher than among men. Various methods of weight reduction are reported in the literature and these include diet modification, physical activity or exercise regime, behavioral intervention and the use of self-monitoring weight loss tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, we carried out a quasi-experimental study for weight loss intervention among 328 overweight and obese housewives who lived in low cost housing (People’s Housing Project) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The study is called My Body is Fit and Fabulous at Home (MyBFF@home) and it was conducted for 12 months. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-18-supplement-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyBFF@home&lt;/a&gt; is one of the government efforts to combat obesity problems among adults in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study aims to empower overweight and obese women to participate in the weight loss intervention and to make several changes to their current lifestyle. In this study, changes in body weight, nutrient intake, body fat, glucose level, lipid profile, health literacy, quality of life and other clinical parameters were monitored and findings of the MyBFF@home are reported in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-18-supplement-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supplement of MyBFF@home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10373&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10373 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/1-300x195.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: Image belongs to MyBFF@home as part of the research project&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MyBFF@home study, we gave women in the intervention group a modest weight loss package consisting of four individual diet counseling sessions, monthly group exercise, dumb bell exercise (at home) and three self-monitoring tools (pedometer, food diary and physical activity diary). The control group only received seven group seminars related to women’s health and two self-monitoring tools (food diary and physical activity diary). We then compared the health outcomes between the groups (before and after) in the intervention and maintenance phases. The overview of the MyBFF@home can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0589-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Introduction article of MyBFF@home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, we found the readiness among the participants to participate in the weight loss program was more than 90% and the motivation level was also good. After 6 months, we detected several changes in body composition, blood pressure level, lipid profile, health literacy level and other parameters among the participants in both groups. These changes were discussed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-18-supplement-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supplement of MyBFF@home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered some interesting findings based on the data analyses. After 6 months, there were some changes in the body weight of the participants in both groups. Weight changes among the participants in the intervention group were greater than the control group. However, these changes were not sustained during the maintenance phase (after 12 months). Although there were no significant changes in overall weight between the two groups, we found that participants in the intervention group showed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0595-z&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;significant increase in their muscle mass compared to before the intervention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found some changes in quality of life among the participants before and after the intervention. Overweight and obese housewives experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0591-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;significant improvements in the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores after the intervention phase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10374&quot; style=&quot;width: 215px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10374 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/2-205x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;205&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: Image belongs to MyBFF@home as part of the research project&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting finding regards health literacy, which is linked to an individual’s knowledge, motivation and behavior in everyday life. We measured the health literacy level among all participants using the modified Newest Vital Sign (NVS) questionnaire and we found that the health literacy level among the participants in both groups was low at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 6 months (weight loss intervention phase), the NVS score in both groups had increased compared to before intervention. However, in the maintenance phase we found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0596-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NVS score of participants in the intervention group had increased further compared to the control group&lt;/a&gt;. This finding indicated that participants in the intervention group were more likely to sustain their behavioral change in everyday life and this could be explored further in the future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, MyBFF@home is the first and largest community-based intervention study among women from low socioeconomic background. Despite some limitations, MyBFF@home has empowered overweight and obese women to combat obesity and to self-monitor their daily diet and physical activities. It is our hope that the findings of the MyBFF@home could support various stakeholders in the obesity prevention program for women in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of psychiatric diagnoses keep on growing, with perhaps ten times as many categories now as there were 50 years ago. This may in part reflect our growing knowledge, which is welcome. But the sheer density of diagnoses makes it difficult for researchers or clinicians to see the wood for the trees, and it encourages them to settle into silos. It would be advantageous for clinical research and practice if we could introduce some elegance to our understanding. A recent movement in psychology and psychiatry is seeking to do exactly this. It follows evidence that, in the words of US psychologists Robert Kruger and Nicholas Eaton in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329885/&quot;&gt;2015 review&lt;/a&gt;, “many mental disorders are manifestations of relatively few core underlying dimensions.” In the latest foray from this movement, the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/i&gt; has published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22585?c&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; outlining another potential core feature: the repetitive occurrence of negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34296&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of psychiatric diagnoses was baked in from the beginning. Modern psychiatry sought to apply the burgeoning medical model to the mind, treating madness as illness. Physical illnesses are considered as discrete categories, even if they produce overlapping symptoms like a fever, because we can point to their distinct microbial origins.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has influenced how we approach mental health, meaning someone struggling could be diagnosed with a phobia and also with an eating disorder and maybe separately with depression (and anxiety, and another eating disorder, and another phobia, and OCD…ad infinitum). We bracket these issues out as if they each originate from their own unique strain of mind bacteria. But mental disorders are rooted in dysfunctional mental processes, of which there are only so many. If we put aside the disease model and look for these processes, maybe we can get to a more solid and elegant foundation.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example would be internalising-externalising. In internalising disorders such as depression, OCD, anxiety and bulimia, the individual tends to draw problems inwards to an inappropriate degree; issues are suppressed or privately managed using ineffective or unhealthy strategies. Meanwhile, externalising disorders like pyromania, kleptomania, and conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, all involve manifesting problematic thoughts or emotions by projecting them onto the world.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According Kruger and Eaton’s landmark review, these aren’t just convenient labels: they may actually be more informative than the specific diagnoses. For instance, suicide risk may be better predicted by internalising in all its forms than a specific diagnosis like depression. Similarly, externalising behaviour of any kind is a strong predictor of other forms of externalising, suggesting that it might sometimes be useful to think of the problem &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; externalising, which can manifest in different ways depending on contextual factors.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this division is too simple to explain everything about mental health. But in interaction with some other features, perhaps we can start to arrive at a complete model that cuts across diagnostic categories while also capturing the richness of psychiatric conditions. What other relevant factors are there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/30/different-psychiatric-symptom-dimensions-have-opposite-associations-wit&quot;&gt;We recently covered work&lt;/a&gt; that suggested another potential trans-diagnostic structure: meta-cognition, the ability to judge your cognitive ability. People who were more anxious or depressed showed more accuracy, but less confidence, in how they judged their performance on a mental task, whereas those who tended towards compulsive behaviour (such as those with schizophrenia or OCD) showed overconfidence and did less well. In our piece we described how this pattern can account for patterns of behaviour found in the real world, such as pessimism and jumping to conclusions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the most recent example, Deanna Kaplan and her team at the University of Arizona suggest another trans-diagnostic feature: “maladaptive repetitive thought”. This is found across many mental health disorders, typically accompanied by a sense that the thoughts are uncontrollable, a negative flavour, and a fixation on&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;seeking rather than solving problems. Consider the ruminative thoughts that characterise depression, the worries that surge up in anxiety, and the obsessive thoughts that drive OCD. Kaplan’s team suggest that these different manifestations should be thought of as variations on a key theme, often differing simply in whether the thoughts are focused on the past, present or future.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their model helped them to draw connections to other related phenomena such as the problematic grief phenomenon of yearning, which pulls you into the past towards a desire that cannot be satisfied. They also see parallels in somatic hypervigilance, the constant monitoring of bodily sensations for any cause for alarm. Again, the same features come up: negative valence, uncontrollability, and seeking of problems, in this case in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not news that unwelcome thoughts are a frequent feature of poor mental health. But as with the internalising and externalising dimensions, it’s possible that grouping mental health problems that share repetitive thought processes could offer fresh way of looking at the root causes of people’s difficulties. It could be that the core problems driving all psychological disorders are countable on our fingers – if so, and if we can identity these core processes, then it will be easier to understand how they develop, and to apply advances from one area of treatment to another, as well as to see when doing so would be ill-advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider how the three features of internalising/externalising, meta-cognitive judgment and repetitive thought processes could be used to organise our understanding of the recently proposed diagnostic category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/25/people-with-maladaptive-daydreaming-spend-an-average-of-four-hours-a-day-lost-in-their-imagination/&quot;&gt;maladaptive daydreaming&lt;/a&gt;, whereby people are compulsively drawn to their daydreams at the cost of their psychological health. This certainly seems to involve internalising, and could involve overconfident misjudgment of whether the daydreaming is beneficial. And what is a daydream if not an extended, imagistic form of thought (much like a yearning)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we may be on the verge of a real advance in psychiatry, akin to the turn from individual symptoms to mental syndromes we made one hundred years ago. By looking past surface issues and gripping the fundamental mental processes that drive confusion and distress, we might be better placed to remedy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22585?c&quot;&gt;Maladaptive repetitive thought as a transdiagnostic phenomenon and treatment target: An integrative review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Toxilatin-2018-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://toxilatin2018.com/en/presentation/&quot;&gt;ToxiLatin&lt;/a&gt; was held at the Universidade Federal do Grande do Sul campus in Porto Alegre, Brazil.  Parallel talks in English and Portuguese were given on the toxic effects of heavy metals, nanomaterials, and pesticides. ToxiLatin aims to disseminate scientific knowledge to everyone in spite of academic wealth, a goal in which they share with BMC, with the ultimate goal to decrease noncommunicable diseases and reduce the socioeconomic disparities of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10329&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10329&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/ToxiLatin-2018-picture-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;From Left to Right: Ben Ragen (Editor BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology), Solange Cristina Garcia (Organizer), Daiana Silva Avila (Co-Organizer), Michael Aschner (Section Editor BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conference, the brilliant and charismatic organizer of the conference, Solange Cristina Garcia (Professor of Toxicology at the Federal university of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), gave a pointed and poignant introduction about ToxiLatin and toxicology research in Brazil, a country of over 207 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this opening address she discussed the 2014 founding of AstoxiLatin (Latin American Association of Environmental, Experimental and Nanomaterial Toxicology). The formation of this society was motivated, mainly, due to the lack of policy and availability of antidotes for cyanide exposure in people affected by the tragic Kiss nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dr. Garcia’s address she discussed the political, social, and financial challenges facing the fifth most populated country in the world as well as the significant cuts in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nanotoxicology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomaterials and their toxic potentials received a significant amount of attention at ToxiLatin this year. Nanomaterials include substances such as polymers, metals, carbon nanotubes, and silicas and are omnipresent. They can be found in body lotions, shampoos, toothpaste, paint, antiperspirants, sunscreen and many other substances humans constantly encounter and dispose of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When assessing the risks of nanomaterials, simply measuring the amount of nanomaterials is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When assessing the risks of nanomaterials, simply measuring the amount of nanomaterials is challenging. After disposal, nanomaterials can be found in water, sludge and soil. These different substrates create challenges in accurately measuring the presence of nanomaterials, which is necessary to determine how nanomaterials behave in the environment and if there are potential damaging effects on the environment and organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10330&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nanomaterials&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10330&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Nanomaterials-300x270.png&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Nanomaterials&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring nanomaterial levels is critical since exposure can have negative health consequences. Nanoparticles are unstable structures and have immunotoxic potential. Exposure to nanoparticles activates the immune system, and has been shown to cause release of cytokines including IL-1β.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ToxiLatin and Toxicology Publishing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I had the honor of participating in a roundtable of Editors discussing publishing in toxicology.  Also present at the roundtable was Dr. Kai Savolainen, Editor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/home/het&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human &amp;amp; Experimental Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Michael Aschner, Editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/neurotoxicology&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NeuroToxicology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and a Section Editor for the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/toxicology&quot;&gt;Toxicology&lt;/a&gt;’ section in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this roundtable, which was particularly important for students, we discussed the importance of journal selection, intriguing titles, strong hypotheses and abstracts, and journal formats.  We had an honest discussion of predatory journals, the current state of the challenges in finding reviewers, and dealing with reviewers’ split decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One critical topic discussed was the conflict researchers in financially starved scientific communities, such as Brazil, experience when deciding to publish in an open access journal or to buy necessary experimental compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One critical topic discussed was the conflict researchers in financially starved scientific communities, such as Brazil, experience when deciding to publish in an open access journal or to buy necessary experimental compounds. Of importance, I stated that when publishing in BMC, finances should not be a prohibitive factor in publishing in our journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ToxiLatin and &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt; Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year ToxiLatin and &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt; have teamed up to publish a supplement of articles related to the conference.  Attendees were encouraged to submit extended abstracts and, after careful vetting and BMC’s standard rigorous peer-review process, an exciting collection of toxicology-related articles will be published at the end of the 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s ToxiLatin was incredibly successful, and its promise of furthering the field of toxicology will continue at the next conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Brain Blogger: VIDEO: How Facebook Preys on Our Mental Health</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://brainblogger.com/?p=23788</guid>
	<link>http://brainblogger.com/2018/07/18/video-how-facebook-preys-on-our-mental-health/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In an ironic turn, the recent controversy surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica eclipsed another controversy brewing months before. As 2017 came to close, the million-dollar question surrounding the company was, &lt;em&gt;Does Facebook make us depressed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in December, even Facebook itself posted an article on its official blog, titled, &lt;em&gt;Hard Questions: Is Spending Time on Social Media Bad For Us? &lt;/em&gt;The post cites a number of studies that prove spending time on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/&quot;&gt;Facebook can threaten well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study from the University of San Diego and Yale found that people who clicked on four times as many links or liked twice as many posts as the average person reported decreased mental health in a survey. A broader study found that increases in “likes clicked,” “links clicked,” or “status updates” was associated with decreases in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though these studies might prove &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;Facebook brings us down, they don’t ask the important question of &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;Facebook brings us down. For a more thorough dive into what truly addict us to the site, ultimately leaving us feeling unsatisfied, check out this video, which explains the subject in depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video presents arguments from two former employees, Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, who claim that Facebook was designed to prey on its users’ neurochemical reward systems. Dopamine, the chemical released in the brain during certain activities, such as exercising, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/31/daytime-nap-productivity-and-brain-functions/&quot;&gt;finishing tasks&lt;/a&gt; at work, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/12/food-and-mood-how-they-influence-each-other/&quot;&gt;finding food&lt;/a&gt;, has also been found to surge during social interactions. The brain desires cooperation and connection, so it sends reward signals in the form of dopamine when this cooperation or connection occurs. It could be something as simple as carrying a couch up a flight of stairs with a friend, or as profound as telling your partner you love her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the brain cannot distinguish between, an interaction in real life and one on Facebook in terms of dopamine release, these rewards systems are integral to Facebook’s interface. Even the little red notification, or the ping sound we’ve all become accustomed to, produce a similar dopamine release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight in the video is that Facebook knows these dopamine hits are essential to their business model, the main driving force bringing people back to the site over and over and over again. Knowing this, they’ve ramped up notifications over the years, spiking our dopamine levels for something as mundane and uninteresting as someone having gone “live” a few hours ago, or a belated birthday, or even just to tell you that you haven’t posted in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens, then, is a uniquely modern phenomenon. Your brain is rewarding you with dopamine for a successful social interaction, but in reality, no genuine connection has occurred, creating a disconnect between the chemical reward system in your brain and your actual lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Facebook can depress its users in a number of ways. People often assume others’ lives are happier than theirs because of how their friends present themselves online. Teen brains are now trained to be distracted based on the interface alone. But this feeling, the dopamine hit followed by immediate disappointment with the reality of a meaningless notification, seems central to the deflating feeling Facebook can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Romain Brette: What is computational neuroscience? (XXXI) The problem of biological measurement (1)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1514</guid>
	<link>http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxi-the-problem-of-biological-measurement-1/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of sensory receptors (photoreceptors, inner hair cells) or sensory neurons (retinal ganglion cells; auditory nerve fibers) as measuring physical dimensions, for example light intensity or acoustical pressure, or some function of it. The analogy is with physical instruments of measure, like a thermometer or a microphone. This confers a representational quality to the activity of neurons, an assumption that is at the core of the neural coding metaphor. I explain at length why that metaphor is misleading in many ways in an essay (Brette (2018) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?&lt;/a&gt;). Here I want to examine more specifically the notion of biological measurement and the challenges it poses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion comes about not only in classical representationalist views, where neural activity is seen as symbols that the brain then manipulates (the perception-cognition-action model, also called sandwich model), but also in alternative views, although it is less obvious. For example, one alternative is to see the brain not as a computer system (encoding symbols, then manipulating them) but as a control system (see Paul Cisek’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisek.org/pavel/Pubs/Cis1999.pdf&quot;&gt;behavior as interaction&lt;/a&gt;, William Powers’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory&quot;&gt;perceptual control theory&lt;/a&gt;, Tim van Gelder’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/the-dynamical-hypothesis-in-cognitive-science/C121F1B65A534F3E7A27075EE489AD1E&quot;&gt;dynamical view of cognition&lt;/a&gt;). In this view, the activity of neurons does not encode stimuli. In fact there is no stimulus per se, as Dewey pointed out: “the motor response determines the stimulus, just as truly as sensory stimulus determines the movement.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple case is feedback control: the system tries to maintain some input at a target value. To do this, the system must compare the input with an internal value. We could imagine for example something like an idealized version of the stretch reflex: when the muscle is stretched, a sensory feedback triggers a contraction, and we want to maintain muscle length constant. But this apparently trivial task raises a number of deep questions, as more generally the application of control theory to biological systems. I suppose there is a sensor, a neuron that transduces some physical dimension into spike trains, for example the stretch of a muscle. There is also an actuator, which reacts to a spike by a physical action, for example contracting the muscle with a particular time course. I chose a spike-based description not just because it corresponds to the physiology of the stretch reflex, but also because it will illustrate some fundamental issues (which would exist also with graded transduction, but less obviously so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a neuron, or a set of neurons, which receive these sensory inputs and send spikes to the actuator. For this discussion, it is not critical that these are actually neurons; we can just consider that there is a system there, and we ask how this system should be designed so as to successfully achieve a control task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major issue here is that the control system does not directly deal with the physical dimension. At first sight, we could think this is a minor issue. The physical dimension gets transduced, and we could simply define the target value in the transduced dimension (eg the current). But here we see that the problem is more serious. What the control system deals with is not simply a function of the physical dimension. More accurately, transduction is a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by a physical signal. The physical signal can be constant, for example, while the transduced current decays (adaptation) and the sensory neuron outputs spike trains, i.e., a highly variable signal. This poses a much more serious problem than a simple calibration problem. When the controlled physical value is at the target value, the sensory neuron might be spiking, perhaps not even at a regular rate. The control system should react to that particular kind of signal by not acting, while it should act when the signal deviates from it. But how can the control system identify the target state, or even know whether to act in one or the opposite direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptation in neurons is often depicted as an optimization of information transmitted, in line with the metaphor of the day (coding). But the relevant question is: how does the receiver of this “information” knows how the neuron has adapted? Does it have to de-adapt, to somehow be matched to the adaptive process of the encoding neuron? (This problem has to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;dualistic structure of the neural coding metaphor&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are additional layers of difficulty. We have first recognized that transduction is not a simple mapping from a physical dimension to a biological (e.g. electrochemical) dimension, but rather a dynamical system influenced by a physical signal. Now this dynamical system depends on the structure of the sensory neuron. It depends for example on the number of ionic channels and their properties, and we know these are highly plastic and indeed quite variable both across time and across cells. This dynamical system also depends on elements of the body, or let’s say more generally the neuron’s environment. For example, the way acoustical pressure is transduced in current by an inner hair cell depends obviously on the acoustical pressure at the eardrum, but that physical signal depends on the shape the ear, which filters sounds. Properties of neurons change with time too, development and aging. Thus, we cannot assume that the dynamical transformation from physical signal to biological signal is a fixed one. Somehow, the control system has to work despite this huge plasticity and the dynamical nature of the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pause for a moment and outline a number of differences between physical measurements, as with a thermometer, and biological measurements (or “sensing”):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The physical meter is calibrated with respect to an external reference, for example 0°C is when water freezes, while 100°C is when it boils. The biological sensor cannot be calibrated with respect to an external reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The physical meter produces a fixed value for a stationary signal. The biological sensor produces a dynamical signal in response to a stationary signal. More accurately, the biological sensor is a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by the physical signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The physical meter is meant to be stable, in that the mapping from physical quantity to measurement is fixed. When it is not, this is considered an error. The biological sensor does not have fixed properties. Changes in properties occur in the normal course of life, from birth to death, and some changes in properties are interpreted as adaptations, not errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these differences, we realize that biological sensors do not provide physical measurements in the usual sense. The next question, then, is how can a biological system control a physical dimension with biological sensors that do not act as measurements of that dimension?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: feeling so grateful to a friend or colleague that we hatch the idea of sending them a thank-you message. But then we worry about how to phrase it. And then we figure it probably won’t mean much to them anyway; if anything it could all be a bit awkward. So we don’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar? According to a pair of US psychologists, a common failure of perspective means that a lot of us underestimate the positive impact on others (and ourselves) of expressing gratitude, meaning that we miss out on a simple way to improve our social relations and wellbeing. Based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618772506&quot;&gt;their series of experiments in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kumar-amit.com&quot;&gt;Amit Kumar&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas at Austin and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kumar-amit.com&quot;&gt;Nicholas Epley&lt;/a&gt; at Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago conclude that “expressing gratitude might not buy everything, but it may buy more than people seem to expect”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34283&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research involved hundreds of participants, some recruited to take part at the psych lab and others online via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. The format through some of the experiments was broadly similar. Participants were asked to write a letter of thanks via email to someone who had touched their life in a meaningful way, including expressing what the person had done and how it had affected their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these experiments, the participants were asked to make various predictions about how the recipient would feel and perceive them. Meanwhile, the researchers made contact with the recipients to find out how they actually felt and what they actually thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senders of the thank-you letters consistently underestimated how positive the recipients felt about receiving the letters and how surprised they were by the content. The senders also overestimated how awkward the recipients felt; and they underestimated how warm, and especially how competent, the recipients perceived them to be. Age and gender made no difference to the pattern of findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other experiments showed that these same misjudgments affect our willingness to write thank-you messages. For instance, participants who felt less competent about writing a message of gratitude were less willing to send one; and, logically enough, participants were least willing to send thank-you messages to recipients who they felt would benefit the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar and Epley believe that this asymmetry between the perspective of the potential expresser of gratitude and the recipient means that we often refrain from a “powerful act of civility” that would benefit both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar dynamic could also play out in other situations. “If people engaging in prosocial actions are more concerned about competence than those benefiting from them, then our experimental results should be just one example of a broader tendency,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A methodological limitation is that the researchers were unable to reach all letter recipients and it’s possible those less impressed by the thank-you note were less willing to take part in the research. However, the available data don’t back this up – for instance, the mis-predictions of the expressers of gratitude were just as great in the experiments in which more recipients took part (therefore reducing the risk that only happy recipients had participated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are intriguing findings that complement other work by Epley and colleagues showing how our fear of awkwardness can lead us to misjudge what is in our own best interests, such as underestimating &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/&quot;&gt;how much we will enjoy interacting with strangers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h4&gt;Why your brain makes bad decisions sometimes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ihSuVpUB703Yo245QA2_g.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Try and try till you succeed may not always be the best advice. (Photo credit: Raeesa Gupte)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I hated the movie but decided to suffer through it because I had paid for the ticket…in 3D!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The store was overpriced but I bought the dress because I drove all the way out there.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“His business isn’t doing well but he’s sticking with it because he’s invested so much time and money in it already!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? How many times have you persisted at a task that you know deep down is an exercise in futility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, decisions should be made based on the magnitude of future benefits for the decision-maker. However, in the real world we often make decisions based on the magnitude of past resources that have already been expended and cannot be recovered (time and money). This “sunk costs” phenomenon makes us persist with our original choices even in the face of better alternatives. If it makes you feel any better, we aren’t the only species susceptible to the sunk costs fallacy. Scientists have discovered that bad decision-making is an evolutionary glitch and exists even in animals other than humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to test if animals make bad decisions based on sunk costs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Minnesota used a clever &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/178&quot;&gt;experimental setup to test susceptibility to sunk costs&lt;/a&gt; across three species: mice, rats, and humans. For rats and mice, they exploited their natural tendency to forage for food. So they designed a “restaurant” for rodents where the menu consisted of four flavors of food pellets: plain, grape, chocolate, and banana (yum!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each flavor was served at a different table that had a decision-making area (offer zone) and a wait-for-the-food area (wait zone). While in the decision-making area, a tone was played that indicated how long the animal would have to wait before it got the food. The wait time varied randomly between 1-30 seconds. Here, they had the choice to either enter the wait area or skip that table and move to the next one. In the wait area, sound tones counted down to indicate how much time was left before the animal would get the food pellet. Here, the animal could choose to wait for the food or to leave at any time and move to the next table. If they left the wait area before the time ran out, they could not return to that particular flavor without going through all the other flavor tables in the restaurant first. Here’s a schematic to explain the experimental setup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/625/1*7eYZbfm1l8P-KiF4Zffw4g.png&quot; /&gt;Credit: Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans. Sweis BM et al., Science, 2018.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to quantify bad decision-making influenced by sunk costs in humans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Netflix-loving, instant streaming-craving Homo Sapiens, scientists modified the foraging task slightly. Knowing how we can all forego food and sleep while binge-watching our favorite shows online, they modeled a web-surfing task for human participants. To ensure that results could reliably be compared across species, they retained the overall basic premise of the rodent experiments while modifying it to sufficiently motivate our superior human brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects could view short videos in one of four galleries under the following categories: dance, accidents, landscapes, or kittens. They were shown how long they would have to wait for the video to download which varied randomly between 1–30 seconds. For each video they could opt to watch the video or skip and move on to the next viewing gallery (similar to the offer zone in the rodent test). Once they clicked on the “stay” option and decided to watch the video, the screen would show a download progression bar indicating how long they would have to wait to view the video (similar to the wait zone in the rodent test). The download could be quit during this wait phase to move on to the next viewing gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/619/1*SLRpJdZ2t63goBxElznGvg.png&quot; /&gt;Credit: Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans. Sweis BM et al., Science, 2018.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what’s the verdict?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice, rats, and humans all fell prey to the sunk cost effect. The more time that rodents spent in the wait area awaiting the food pellet, the more likely they were to persist till the end. Similarly, the longer that humans waited for the video to download, the more likely they were to stay till it finished downloading to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, it turned out that the time rodents and humans took to decide on the offer had no impact on how much they then persisted in waiting for it. Only when they had committed to a particular flavor food pellet or video did their probability of persisting till the very end increase. These experiments show that we keep track of effort invested in waiting, not deciding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the longer they waited for their chosen reward, the more likely they were to persist till the end. In short, the more resources (time/money/energy) you commit to a particular task, the stronger your resolve to stay the course even if it is to your own detriment! On the other hand, the amount of time spent waiting correlated positively with how much the reward was valued. For example, after consuming the food pellet rodents lingered longer at the table where they spent a longer time waiting and humans rated videos that took longer to download as more enjoyable. Now you know why you cherish an outcome you worked really hard for more than an easy victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would evolution want you to persist in the face of failure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists postulate that two distinct decision-making algorithms may be at play in the brain when making choices based on sunk costs. Before committing to a task, the brain has to estimate its value to an organism by predicting future outcomes. This is a complex and difficult process. Therefore, brains of different species may have evolved in a similar manner to use past effort as a measure of predicting future value. Unfortunately, in many real-life scenarios there may only be a very limited correlation between past resources spent and future value to be gained. In such cases the parts of our brain that evolved to minimize wastage of resources kicks in and urges us not to stop till we have achieved our goal. So let’s hope our brains continue to learn and evolve to make better life-choices!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning lemons into lemonade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps evolution has dealt us a raw deal. But there’s a silver lining yet. Understanding the neurological basis of decision-making can have far-reaching implications for developing better educational programs, economic policies, and interventions for psychiatric disorders. For instance, understanding the neurobiology of sunk costs can aid in the treatment of addiction by developing drugs that alter the underlying malfunctioning neuronal circuitry or by use of cognitive behavioral therapy. This is not an unattainable goal given that the one thing we excel at as scientists is persistence!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can follow this crossword-solving, travel-seeking, camera-touting scientist constantly torn between coffee and chai on Twitter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@NeuroRaeesa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;@NeuroRaeesa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;In theory, our personal traits and interests should affect the jobs we pursue and where we thrive the most. This assumption is baked into the Work Psychology theory of “person-environment fit” and it’s an idea that is foundational to services we depend on like vocational guidance and career planning. But one of its key implications has until now been untested: that people who share the same job role will also have similar job interests. Now a surprising new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879118300447&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Vocational Behavior&lt;/i&gt; suggests that for many jobs, this simply isn’t true.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34275&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan State University research team led by Christopher Nye used the Strong Interest Inventory (that measures interest in six areas: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional) to determine whether people in the same occupation were similar in terms of which was their top-ranked interest.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among their sample of 67,000 people, across 211 jobs, those in the same occupational role did sometimes show a strong tendency to share the same primary interest – the strongest example being for fine artists, auto mechanics and carpenters, where in each case, 82 per cent of role holders shared the same focus – Artistic for the first and Realistic for the latter two.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people in other occupations showed much less similarity in interests. For instance, in almost half of the occupations, only the thinnest of majorities tended to share the same interest, meaning that a lot of the time two people in the exact same job often had very different occupational interests.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the results be skewed by the sample being stacked with people trapped in jobs that they hate? This isn’t plausible, as the study only involved people who were reasonably satisfied in their role and had worked there at least three years.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible the variability was exaggerated by only focusing on the top interest. So in a second study using different occupational samples (58 datasets in total), the research team tried a more sophisticated statistical angle that looked for the degree of alignment between a person’s top three interests and the three interests conventionally considered to characterise the job. Nye’s team found that just over half the jobs showed more alignment than you would expect to see at random, but the remaining 45 per cent were the same or less. What this means is that a sizeable minority of occupations are filled by people who aren’t especially interested in the type of work their role is understood to require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders of person-environment fit could rustle up some retorts. You might find people with a poor fit in jobs with low barriers to entry, which are easy to fall into without any forethought. Perhaps if analysis were restricted to challenging vocations with higher barriers to entry, or people staying in jobs for a long time, there would be&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;far more congruence between interests and job roles? In fact, the first study showed no effect of occupational tenure – people longer in jobs did not have a better fit than newer incumbents. And the second study showed that employees in several jobs that require extensive preparation or specialist education also had diverse interests, such as secondary school teacher and even clergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests we should reconsider the assumption that people are primarily drawn to jobs because of the types of things they want to do. In some cases this is sure to be true, but exceptions abound. Some people chase a job not for what it involves but for the money, or security, or the company they get to keep. And people may find ways to shape jobs around their own interests – called job crafting – or be able to draw from it rewards that may not be obvious to everyone, such as the London Tube station assistant who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/paperback-tunnel-visions-by-christopher-ross-9183130.html&quot;&gt;wrote a book&lt;/a&gt; on how the experience delivered to his philosophical, Investigative interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work may give some careers advisors pause for thought – occupational interests are often used as the easy shorthand to determine recommendations, but a multi-level approach considering personality and broader life goals is preferable. And for ourselves, we should allow our curiosity to be roused. When you’re next at work, why not ask your colleagues what led them to the work they are doing, and what they get from it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The answer is likely to surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
