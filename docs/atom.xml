		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22944</id>
		<updated>2017-10-16T15:30:51+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The early Egyptians and Romans recognized the numbing effect of the electric properties of catfish. In fact, Romans were the first to cultivate electric fishes for pain relieving effect. But since then, not much has changed in the development of electricity based medical treatments. Things only started to change two millennia later with the discovery of electricity and a better understanding of neurophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/09/22/shock-therapy-a-thing-of-the-past-or-the-only-way-out/&quot;&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy&lt;/a&gt; was born in the middle of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. In the early days, it was primarily used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. In the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, direct electric current was used for electroconvulsive therapy. By the end of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century, the alternate current was discovered, and its use along with the use of magnetic fields became the subject of experiments not only investigating neuropsychiatric conditions but also other diseases like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/04/10/ketogenic-diet-for-epilepsy-and-other-neurological-disorders/&quot;&gt;epilepsy &lt;/a&gt;and chronic severe headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy is still used in the treatment of severe neuropsychiatric conditions like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/13/schizophrenias-strongest-genetic-link/&quot;&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; or depression, where suicidal tendencies do not respond to pharmacological agents. Unlike in the old days, now this is a non-invasive treatment usually performed under general anesthesia. The therapy non-selectively resets various centers in the brain and thus has wide-ranging side effects like loss of memory, headaches, and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the widespread side effects of electroconvulsive therapy, the need for more selective stimulation of particular brain centers specific for a particular disease was obvious. The improvements in understanding of brain physiology and surgical techniques gave rise to “&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/&quot;&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;” (DBS). This is an invasive method where electrodes are surgically placed inside the specific part of the brain that are connected to a small electrical device that generates the stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, DBS has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/07/13/multifaceted-causes-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/&quot;&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and dystonia. It is being studied for applications in treating depression, drug addiction, and other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia. As the method is invasive and involves the surgical implantation of electrodes inside the brain, it is reserved for cases that fail to respond to pharmacological therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain that plays an important role in physical movement. In Parkinson’s disease, there is a progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons resulting in motor deficiencies. Thus, the first line therapy for this disease is to give dopamine replacement therapy by prescribing a drug called &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/&quot;&gt;levodopa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, one-third of cases of Parkinson’s disease progress quickly and stop responding to the therapy with levodopa or other pharmacological agents, thus necessitating a treatment like DBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the best results, it is recommended to go for DBS well before the symptoms become debilitating. In the later stages, the effectiveness of DBM tends to be lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/15/the-gut-brain-axis-part-5-parkinsons-disease/&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; involves the application of continuous high-frequency electrical pulses through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the brain (though sometimes other locations may also be chosen). The STN is demonstrated to be over-activated in Parkinson’s disease. These electrodes are connected to the compatible pulse generating device. The pulse generator uses various pulses to achieve the optimal effect, where the right kind of settings can be chosen for a person by assessing treatment effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous DBS was shown to improve motor symptoms in more than two-thirds of patients, as compared to no stimulation or intermitted stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the clinical studies, bilateral STN DBS was performed on patients that were not responding to the maximum dose of levodopa or to a continuous infusion of apomorphine. DBS showed marked improvement in motor function in 61% of cases. After the procedure, there was a 37.1% decrease in the daily dosage of levodopa in the patients. There was an almost 70% decrease in the need for apomorphine, with some patients not requiring apomorphine at all. Thus, the effectiveness of bilateral STN DBS in advanced Parkinson’s disease is well established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the exact mechanism whereby DBS is effective is still unknown, it is believed to involve overcoming abnormal electrical patterns generated in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the devices and surgical technique being constantly refined,  the effectiveness of this treatment may improve sufficiently enough to be widely used during the early stages of the disease in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, DBS is still an experimental treatment. Lots of research with the use of various techniques has been done on animals, some with positive results. In one such study in monkeys, intermittent DBS was used with 60 pulses for 20 seconds with an interval of 40 seconds in between. The experiment demonstrated improvements in the memory of the primates. The experiment also showed deterioration of memory following continuous stimulation. The differences with results in the treatment of Parkinsonism might be explained by the differing pathological mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of intermittent stimulation, the monkeys demonstrated improvements in memory even on discontinuation of stimulation. This lasting effect has not yet been explained. It is quite possible that such intermittent stimulation results in an improved connection between neurons, or higher levels of release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS has certain benefits over drugs, as it stimulates specific areas of the brain, while anticholinergic drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s have widespread non-selective action. Thus, DBM may prove to be a safer treatment option in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be noted that apart from DBS, non-invasive neurostimulation using &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/12/11/using-magnets-on-the-brain-to-bring-back-memories/&quot;&gt;transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; has also demonstrated promising effects in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading information about the benefits of exercise – including how it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216370/dh_128210.pdf&quot;&gt;reduces the risk of chronic diseases and improves mental health and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, from sleep quality to self-esteem – hasn’t been enough to change people’s behaviour. Only 30 to 40 per cent of adults in the UK &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.digital.nhs.uk/pubs/hse08physicalactivity&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they get the recommended amount of physical activity per week, and this figure drops to just 5 per cent when using accelerometers to measure movement. It’s a similar story even for people who have made the effort to join a gym – in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brits-wasting-558m-unused-gym-9679158&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt;, a third of members reported visiting their gym three times a year or less. It seems we need to get more creative to persuade people to get active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test out some innovative psychological approaches, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804317300861&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics&lt;/i&gt; selected 181 infrequent gym-goers at the University of West Chester, who went on average less than once a week before the experiment. All students at the university have free access to the fitness centre, and their attendance is automatically recorded when they swipe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-31132&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested three types of intervention, in isolation or combined, over the course of three weeks. First was the financial incentive: everyone (except the control group) was entered into a lottery, with a chance to win an $80 Amazon voucher if they met their weekly exercise goal of three 30-minute sessions. Second, some participants were partnered up, and were only eligible for the lottery if both members of the team had met the goal. Finally, half of the participants were given information midweek about how many other individuals or teams had already reached the weekly target. In all, there were five participant groups: the control, individuals with information (about others’ attendance), individuals without information, teams with information and teams without information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lottery increased gym attendance in all groups during the study from their pre-experiment average of less than once a week. Individuals enrolled in the lottery on their own, but without information about others, more than doubled their attendance to almost 1.5 visits per week, although this effect was not statistically significant. The individuals enrolled in the lottery on their own and who also had access to information about other people’s behaviour increased their visits to almost twice per week. The most impressive result was for the participants enrolled in the lottery in a two-person team – whether they had access to information about other people’s behaviour or not, they tripled their average visit rate to more than three times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also monitored behaviour for several weeks after the experiment. All groups kept going to the gym slightly more than they had done before the experiment, particularly the individuals with information. Looking specifically at non-users, defined as those who had not used the gym at all in the four weeks before the study, the researchers found that 80 per cent went at least once during and once after the intervention. Furthermore, non gym-users who received information were more likely to keep going than other groups. However, none of the interventions had a lasting effect beyond the Thanksgiving break four weeks after the experiment finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not entirely surprising that the lottery alone was less motivating than being in a team or receiving information. Financial incentives or penalties aren’t always the best way to change behaviour; as most of us know, paying for a gym membership is no guarantee you’ll actually go. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/incentives-exercise.pdf&quot;&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; using financial rewards for exercise have found better uptake and maintenance even after they were removed. The less impressive results in the current study could be due to a number of reasons, such as the short duration of the experiment, the relatively small amount of money, or the reward being a lottery rather than a guaranteed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in teams exercised most frequently during the experiment, which is consistent with research in a range of domains that finds people are more motivated when others are also relying on them. The researchers didn’t indicate whether participants were introduced to their teammates, which can make these interventions more effective. People are less willing to disappoint people they know, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.636.5148&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;friends increase each other’s attendance when they are paired up, while an anonymous partner can be less effective than an individual incentive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind the effectiveness of the information intervention is unclear. It could simply have acted as a reminder for people to squeeze three sessions in, prompting a spike in attendance towards the end of the week. The researchers suggest that knowing what others were doing could have made the lottery prize seem more accessible, as very few had completed three sessions by midweek. This seems more likely than a social norm explanation, which would assume the low numbers would reduce motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be unwise to draw too many conclusions from this study, particularly given its short duration and limited sample size. It does however suggest that information and team dynamics, together or in isolation, can be cost-effective, easy-to-deliver ways to promote physical activity.  For example, gyms could trial providing feedback on how many members had attended that week – although they may be unwilling to do so, given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.96.3.694&quot;&gt;their business models&lt;/a&gt; often rely on people paying but not turning up.&lt;/p&gt;

 Recently I was reading a neuroscience paper and was struck by the cuteness of the two mice that formed part of Figure 1:



So I decided to look further and collect a montage of scientific mice. All of these drawings are taken from peer-reviewed scientific papers. As you can see, the styles vary greatly. Some mice are little more than circles with ears, while others look ready to leap off the page in search of cheese:

 The Journal of Neuroscience recently featured a debate over the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease is, at least in some cases, caused by prions - misfolded proteins that spread from neuron to neuron.



A prion is a protein that has taken on an abnormal shape and that can spread itself by making other, healthy molecules of the same protein adopt its abnormal configuration. The best-known prion disease is variant CJD aka &quot;mad cow disease&quot;, but some researchers believe that Parkinson's is als</content>

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/13/detrimental-effect-of-bright-screens-on-sleep-pattern/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22939</id>
		<updated>2017-10-13T15:30:30+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;We often complain about people around us constantly being glued to their phone. Mobile technology is everywhere these days. When not on the go, we still tend to stare at computer screens both in the office and back at home. For many, this addiction to high-tech devices represents a way to be connected to friends and family. Many others think that these devices isolate us from real interaction with the world around us. One way or another, we do indeed spend too much time with our computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from changing the way we communicate (for better or worse), all these devices have one more thing in common: bright screens. These light emitting screens can seriously affect our sleeping pattern. Moreover, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/15/turn-off-your-screens-before-turning-in/&quot;&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; (of a wavelength of ~470 nm) that is emitted by these devices is particularly harmful to normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, an increasingly large number of people report problems with sleeping. Many people can’t fall asleep in the evening and then do not feel refreshed the next morning when they have to go to work. Lots of people complain about disturbed shallow sleeping and frequent awakenings at night. With normal sleeping hours often affected, people sleep less at night and if they can, compensate for this lack of sleep with daytime naps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbed sleep patterns are often linked to a diminished ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/10/challenging-goal-improve-focus-by-engaging-your-brain/&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; on work, lack of motivation, and a generally low mood. This may lead to conflicts and stress at the workplace resulting, in some cases, in anxiety and depression. There are long-term negative consequences for other organs and systems of the body too. For instance, the link between chronically bad sleep and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/11/20/young-at-heart-depression-and-cardiovascular-mortality-in-young-adults/&quot;&gt;cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; is well documented. Sleeping pattern disturbances also contribute to excessive body weight. It is estimated that around half of all Americans suffer from chronic stress at moderate or severe levels. Disturbingly, this number is growing in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from many social and psychological factors, the growing level of stress in the general population can also be linked to the growing and excessive use of computers and smartphones. Exposure to bright screens in the evening hours is particularly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our circadian rhythm (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/22/older-age-dementia-and-circadian-rhythms/&quot;&gt;sleep-wake pattern&lt;/a&gt;) is regulated by our exposure to light. There are several components of this system that are particularly important. First, we have specific cells in our eye retina that function as detectors of the duration and intensity of light. These cells, called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are particularly sensitive to short wavelength blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-exposed ipRGC cells send signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain. This region is responsible for setting the body clock, achieved by regulating the production of the hormone melatonin in the pineal gland. Melatonin plays a role in the adjusting mechanism: it synchronizes the body’s circadian rhythms with the real-life cycle of day and night experienced by the body. The problem is, this system can be easily fooled by prolonged exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/22/artificial-light-and-circadian-rhythm-are-we-messing-it-up/&quot;&gt;artificial light&lt;/a&gt;. When you stare at your laptop screen late in the evening, you are also sending a signal to your brain that you are currently experiencing daytime. Your body will try to adjust accordingly to help you take advantage of daytime hours—it will reduce your desire to sleep. And once the screen is off, you don’t feel like sleeping anymore…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently published experimental data demonstrated that just two hours of evening exposure to bright computer screens emitting blue light decreases sleep duration and, more importantly, dramatically reduces its quality. People exposed to computer screens were awakening during the night much more often compared to those who did not use computers in the evening. The data also demonstrated that both the type of light emitted by the screens and its intensity is important for nighttime sleep quality. The screens with low brightness were less disturbing for sleep quality, and the screens emitting red light did not affect nighttime sleep at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to blue light-emitting bright screens in the morning is actually a positive thing: it can help to readjust the body to the correct time of the day. In fact, morning exposure to blue light is even used in a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/&quot;&gt;bright light therapy &lt;/a&gt;methods aimed at normalizing the circadian cycle, particularly in elderly people who often experience sleep-wake pattern disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite unlikely that after reading this article anyone will immediately give up the habit of late-night internet browsing or chatting with friends via social networks before going to sleep. There are, however, several simple methods to reduce evening exposure to blue light emitted by screens. First, you can reduce the brightness of your screen. You can also change the background color while reading some types of documents. Text with white letters on a black background definitely reduces light exposure. If you anticipate working with documents in the evening, it might be a good idea to print them out. Paper is certainly much friendlier to the eyes. It is also possible to cover your computer screens with special filters that block out blue light. These small changes won’t require any major changes to your habits and routine but will help you to regain a normal sleep-wake pattern and bolster feeling refreshed the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/BPG-conf-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference started with a plenary by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/scienceresearch/staff-bios/cheryl-asa-phd/&quot;&gt;Cheryl Asa&lt;/a&gt; from the AZA Reproductive Management Center at Saint Louis Zoo. Reproduction in zoos is important to maintain captive populations without importing animals from the wild. Cheryl spoke on the evolving role of reproductive biology in zoos including its challenges such as genetic health, mate incompatibility and female infertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other interesting talks on the first day focused on wolf conservation in Portugal, the restoration of the North Persian leopard population in the Russian Caucasus and snaring of spotted hyenas in the Serengeti. Annika Tiesmeyer’s research on the assessment of the conservation status through a clever monitoring technique on the example of the European wildcat was a nice example of a citizen science project where average citizens helped by collecting wildcat DNA from valerian-treated hair traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was opened with an excellent plenary talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://nature.berkeley.edu/beislab/BeissingerLab/&quot;&gt;Steven R. Beissinger&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California on the climate and land-use impacts on the metacommunity dynamics of California birds and mammals. A key aspect of Steven’s talk was the importance of linking the past to the future on the example of the pen and paper notes by Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues. Steven and his team resampled historical biodiversity surveys of Grinnell originally surveyed for birds and mammals from 1908-1939 to understand the influence of 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century environmental changes on biodiversity. In this context, Steven stressed that one day the notes we take today will be historic and highlighted the importance of data preservation. Incidentally, our sister journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt; has recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/about/introducing-data-notes&quot;&gt;data notes&lt;/a&gt; with the goal to support researchers with good data practice and to preserve valuable research data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someday your data will be historic. How will you preserve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven R. Beissinger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; poster session in one of the impressive glasshouses of the Berlin Botanical Garden, thunderstorm “Xavier” reached full strength and forced delegates to stay inside. The organizers’ talent for improvisation came to light as delegates could not come to the talks; the talks were brought to the delegates. Daniel Blumenstein opened the session with an excellent overview of his work on social relationships in marmots. An interesting take away message was that meaningful social relationships can buffer stress and enhance security in marmots – perhaps something for all of us to remember!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fantastic plenary talk was delivered on the final day by &lt;a href=&quot;https://nature.berkeley.edu/beislab/BeissingerLab/&quot;&gt;Klaus-Peter Koepfli&lt;/a&gt; from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute National Zoological Park. In his talk, Klaus-Peter Koepfli provided an overview of a program to develop and apply data derived from whole genome sequences to the management of &lt;em&gt;ex&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;situ&lt;/em&gt; population of endangered species, specifically the sable anteleope and the black-footed ferret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMC sponsored the conference and the winner and runner-up of the poster competition received a full and half-waiver of the article processing charge for a publication in a BMC series journal. Iris Tarmann won the prize for best poster with her work on the impact of global warming on hibernation of garden dormice. Jessica Svea Cornils was a close second by popular vote with her work on why edible dormice prefer areas with diverse tree species to optimize survival and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9566&quot; style=&quot;width: 1440px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9566 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1651&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/tiger-ct.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1430&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Credit: Leibniz-IZW.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the closing session, delegates were invited to a guided tour through the Leibniz-IZW. As an internationally respected research institution, the Leibniz-IZW conducts research on the evolutionary adaptation of wildlife populations and develops new concepts and measures for wildlife conservation with a focus on mammals. A highlight of the tour was the presentation of the cutting-edge CT scanner in veterinary medicine by Guido Fritsch which can be used for large cats and has even seen famous Berlin polar bear Knut following his unexpected death in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BPG conference organized every two years by the IZW and EAZA is a small but fantastic conference that researchers working on the behavior, physiology and genetics of wildlife animals will enjoy. &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt; was impressed with the line-up of high quality plenary speakers and we would be delighted to visit Berlin again in two years.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Figure_1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of an ant queen, they are likely to have an image of a monarch, tended to and protected by her daughters, the sterile workers. Unlike the workers, which carry out all the hard and dangerous tasks, the queen is kept safe, deep within a subterranean bunker that is her nest. There she will live, for perhaps as long as several decades (the current record being about 30 years), laying hundreds of eggs every day, whilst being fed and cleaned by a retinue of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, life for an ant queen does not typically start out this way. In fact, the majority of queens are likely to die before they have even raised their first batch of workers. This is because new queens, produced by mature ant colonies, must leave the parental nest to found new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that less than 1% of queens actually survive beyond their first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many founding queens fall prey to birds, spiders and the workers of other colonies during the process, as well as contracting bacterial and fungal infections from the soil that cause disease and death. Moreover, because they do not forage, they must breakdown their own body tissue in order to feed themselves and their brood until their workers emerge, making starvation a likely possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young colonies are also at risk of being raided by larger ones, which will steal their brood and kill the queen. As a consequence, it is estimated that less than 1% of queens actually survive beyond their first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A joint venture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve their chances of survival, some queens will found a colony with unrelated queens from other nests. Termed co-founding, this behaviour is thought to be beneficial as a pair of queens may raise more workers faster than a single queen, potentially giving them a competitive edge. Yet, the exact reasons behind co-founding are up for debate and it may simply be the result of overcrowding and competition for the best nest sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founding still has its drawbacks, however, since the queens fight to the death for control of the nest once it has workers. Additionally, before this, co-founding may increase a queen’s risk of infection if her co-founder falls sick and dies. In mature colonies, dead and/or infected nest mates are quickly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8251.abstract&quot;&gt;removed from the nest&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/116657&quot;&gt;destroyed by the workers&lt;/a&gt;. These “undertaking” behaviours keep the nest clean and prevent diseases from spreading. In the absence of workers, how do co-founding queens overcome this problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9561&quot; style=&quot;width: 1876px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9561 size-full&quot; height=&quot;928&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/infectious_queen-e1507800896302.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1866&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A dead queen infected with the pathogenic fungus &lt;em&gt;Metarhizium&lt;/em&gt;. The green “blocks” are dense packages of infectious fungal spores.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to answer this question in our recent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0201-4&quot;&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, using queens of the common black garden ant and a generalist fungal pathogen. In our first experiment, we carried out a choice test, to see whether queens, faced with the choice of founding a colony alone or with a queen carrying infectious fungal spores on her body, avoid the pathogen-exposed queen. As a control, another set of queens could choose to found alone or with a sham-treated queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the risk of nesting with a pathogen-exposed queen, we found co-founding to be high (about 60%) in all of our treatment groups, suggesting that the avoidance of pathogen-exposed queen is not a mechanism queens use to reduce their risk of contracting infections from co-founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second experiment, we paired queens with either a pathogen-exposed or sham-treated queen, in either closed or open nests ­­– the latter having a hole that opens to a small arena. Once the pathogen-exposed queens started dying of infections, we freeze-killed the queens in the control group to see how the surviving queens react to both infected and uninfected corpses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9562&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9562 size-full&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/IMG_9822.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Freshly collected founding queens were painted for identification in experiments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Freshly collected founding queens were painted for identification in experiments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strange undertakings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that the surviving queens performed undertaking behaviours. Namely, corpses were bitten into pieces and buried, or, in the open nests, removed from the nest entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the surviving queens performed undertaking behaviours. Namely, corpses were bitten into pieces and buried, or, in the open nests, removed from the nest entirely. Interestingly, although queens carried out these behaviours before the fungal pathogen became infectious (grew out of the corpse), it seems unlikely that the queens are responding directly to the presence of an infection, because the uninfected corpses were treated exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queens therefore seem to perform undertaking behaviour prophylactically, i.e. before there are any signs of disease on the corpse. From the perspective of the queen, it makes sense to treat all corpses as equally risky, because waiting until the pathogen grows out may be too late to prevent disease transmission. Indeed, we found that biting the corpses into pieces and burying them significantly reduced the risk of the queens contracting a lethal infection from the corpse when the fungus did grow out, presumably because burial prevents transmission of the fungal spores. In other words, performing undertaking behaviours improved founding queen survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work shows that, in contrast to the typical view of ant queens focussing solely on reproduction and avoiding all risky tasks, queens can perform complex behaviours to protect themselves when they lack workers to do so for them. In fact, there are some ant queens, considered to be more evolutionarily basal species, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/1950/072123/citations/&quot;&gt;which still forage during colony foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.038&quot;&gt;queens that fail to mate and remain in their parental nest begin behaving like workers&lt;/a&gt;, and will even forage outside of the nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding this behavioural flexibility, and its underlying genetic mechanisms, could provide an interesting insight into what makes a queen a queen, and the evolution of separate queen and worker castes in the social insects.&lt;/p&gt;

Invest in food security and rural development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – highlights the challenges brought about in a world where more and more people are on the move, seeking political stability and better circumstances.  With this putting an increased strain on available resources,  it is essential that strategies be put into place to address rural development and the creation of favorable conditions to retain populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food security is defined as ‘the state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.’ In sub-Saharan Africa, there are many examples of food insecurity and some of them have reached catastrophic levels, having also been affected  by severe floods and droughts. Since 1990, the number of stunted children in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 33% even though it has fallen in all other world regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food insecurity is not just about insufficient food production, availability, and intake, but is also about the poor quality or nutritional value of the food.  While, for example, most staple foods such as cereals, tubers and pulses are rich in Vitamin C, they have very low concentrations of iron, Vitamin A and zinc. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4576-1&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; uses the proportion of household food spending on staples to explain stunting and wasting among children aged 5 years or less in Uganda, a country with a wide variety of staple foods. The researchers find that a greater proportion of less nutritious staple foods is associated with both wasting and stunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise but food insecurity is a growing public health concern in the United States.  American Indian families are particularly vulnerable as they have limited access to healthy foods and higher levels of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that no studies to date have examined the relationship between household food insecurity and dietary intake in American Indian adults or in very young American Indian children, the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4498-y&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; sought to determine the prevalence of food insecurity in American Indian households and its correlates.  They identify an extremely high prevalence of food insecurity among the American Indian households included in their study, with the proportion of households self-reporting food insecurity significantly different between rural and urban households. Their analysis also suggests that identification as American Indian, urban households, lower educational levels, single adult households, and participation in ‘Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ‘ are factors that are associated with the increased odds for being food insecure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food insecurity and obesity: a public health paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unlikely as it may sound, food insecure children are more likely to be obese. Healthful and affordable food options in low-income neighborhoods or countries can be hard to come across, meaning that parents opt for food which is cheap but not necessarily nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9521&quot; style=&quot;width: 250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9521&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/unhealthy.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Low-income communities have greater access to energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Flickr: Mr.TinDC
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4317-5&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; measures socioeconomic correlates of household food insecurity and explores its association with dietary intake and odds of obesity among mothers in Lebanon, a middle-income country undergoing nutrition transition. It reports that a high household food insecurity prevalence exists among urban Lebanese households and that mothers from these households have a high risk of dietary inadequacy and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving low-income areas access to affordable foods would be a significant step towards healthier communities but this is challenging. Programs need to be developed at local and national levels to increase the dietary quality and diversity of foods consumed by at-risk populations through promoting the consumption of affordable nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, and protein-rich foods, and lowering the intake of added sugars and refined grains. School-related policies which provide nutritious meals to children who are otherwise not receiving these at home provides an example of a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/12/toxoplasma-gondii-common-brain-parasite-behind-brain-disorders/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22937</id>
		<updated>2017-10-12T15:30:15+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Most people have never heard of the brain parasite called &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;. We tend to think that creatures of such kind belong to the realm of exotic tropical diseases affecting people somewhere in miasmatic swamps of equatorial jungles. However, toxoplasma infection is remarkably common: it is believed that one in every three persons around the world have it. And not only in tropical regions, the prevalence of this infection in France is estimated at 84%! In fact, &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most common parasites in the developed world. The majority of people reading this article have it in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the infection is so common, why is it hardly ever mentioned? The reason is simple. As horrible as it sounds to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/21/cats-and-mental-illness-the-role-of-toxoplasma-gondii/&quot;&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt; living in your brain, the infection with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is asymptomatic and doesn’t seem to affect us in any obvious way. The initial exposure to the parasite may cause some flu-like symptoms, but very soon the infection enters latent stages and does not manifest itself. It can, however, become dangerous in people with weakened immune system, such as those with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/12/12/preventing-hiv-before-exposure/&quot;&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite has a rather curious life cycle. It can live in almost any warm-blooded animal, but its major hosts are cats and other felines. In their bodies, the parasite can sexually reproduce giving rise to new generations of offspring. In other animals, as well as in humans, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; can only reproduce asexually. Thus, feline species are the definite hosts of &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, while humans can only be intermediate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oocysts produced in cats get excreted with feces and spread in the environment. This is where they can be picked up by rats and mice. In these animals, the parasite eventually reaches the brain, and here is where something really unusual happens. The parasite modifies the behavior of the rodents, making them less afraid of the smell of cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the brain infection affects the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/11/motor-neurons-why-are-they-important-and-how-are-they-made/&quot;&gt;motor ability&lt;/a&gt; of animals, thereby making them easier prey for cats. These behavioral changes are achieved by introducing some epigenetic modifications affecting key neurons regulating the above behavioral characteristics. The behavioral modification of the host increases the chances of the parasite getting into the body of cats, and thus increases the chances of its reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important question is: does the infection with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; change human behavior as well? It appears that the answer to this question is yes. The results of psychological testing published in 2007 demonstrated gender-dependent changes in the behavior of humans affected by toxoplasmosis. Infected men had a tendency to disregard rule and were more expedient, suspicious, and jealous. Infected women, however, were more warmhearted, conscientious, and moralistic. The gender differences are related to different levels of testosterone in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motor functions also appear to be affected in infected people. One study demonstrated a 2.65 times higher chance of traffic accidents among people with latent toxoplasmosis. The antibodies to the parasite were detected more often among &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/11/happy-retirement-5-ways-to-prolong-the-golden-years/&quot;&gt;drivers&lt;/a&gt; who were involved in traffic accidents, as compared to the statistical average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a number of reports demonstrated a correlation between toxoplasmosis and the incidence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that the risk of attempted suicide is also higher among people affected by latent &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; infection. Correlation does not necessarily imply that the infection is the causative factor of neurological disorders, but it is likely to be a risk factor in the development of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to mention here that not all researchers believe that &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; infection really affects human behavior or the risk of diseases to any significant degree. Some recently published studies indicate that these risks are very small, and the previously published correlations with various behavioral changes are not as significant as we might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most recent publication on this subject sounds the alarm again. Scientists used comprehensive systems analysis to look at the range of biomarkers generated by various parasites and to assess their impact in a large cohort of subjects. The data point to a correlation between toxoplasmosis and several neurodegenerative conditions including &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;T. gandii&lt;/em&gt; infection was also positively correlated with epilepsy and a number of cancers. The scientists not only identified correlations, they also described the biochemical pathways that may actually lead to the increased risk of developing these conditions. They concluded that toxoplasmosis is a risk factor for many neurological disorders, and thus this infection has to be taken into consideration when developing strategies for preventing or delaying the onset of various brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can something be done to cure or at least prevent &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; infection? Unfortunately, not much. There are no drugs or vaccines to treat this infection. There is a number of simple strategies to decrease the risk of infection among healthy people. They include avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked meat (among humans, this is the most common way of getting infected), as well as general basic food handling safety practices.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/lpPTOx5cGa0/nature24269"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24269</id>
		<updated>2017-10-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;
 In several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies remain unknown. In the case of Barrett’s oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett’s oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63+KRT5+KRT7+) at the squamous–columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous–columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett’s metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett’s oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63+KRT5+KRT7+ basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett’s oesophagus.

 &lt;p&gt;Rebecca will be presenting the work she conducted for her master's thesis titled 'How the Olfactory Bulb processes naturalistic time-varying inputs'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb in mammals is responsible for receiving, processing and relaying olfactory
information (odours). This project investigates how naturalistic temporally fluctuating odour signals are
processed and which neurons or neural mechanisms are able to extract information from these signals.
Multiple computation models were created to represent different OB circuits between periglomerular
cells and mitral cells using NEURON (Hines and Carnevale, 2006, 2001). The results show that the
strength and frequency of these odour signals can be determined by looking at a combination of the
latency and the firing rates of the output from the mitral cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation highlights the results obtained in a four-years project aiming at analyzing the development process of software artifacts from two points of view: Effectiveness and Affectiveness. The first attribute is meant to analyze the productivity of the Open Source Communities by measuring the time required to resolve an issue, while the latter provides a novel approach for studying the development process by analyzing the affectiveness expressed by developers in their comments posted during the issue resolution.
Affectivenes is obtained by measuring Sentiment, Politeness and Emotions and other emotional state indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At least one disgruntled co-author has triggered the retraction of a paper presenting a novel approach to treating a rare, genetically inherited condition. The paper concerned research on Fragile X syndrome (FXS), characterized by both intellectual and physical abnormalities, which is linked autism. A compound that passed through phase 2 clinical trials in October 2015 […]&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2016, researchers published a paper showing that an RNA molecule may be overactive in breast tumor tissue. But after reading the paper, three biologists believed the data supported the opposite conclusion. What happened after that is a tale of misunderstandings and unnecessarily bruised feelings.

The targeted brain region was bilateral &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;aka Brodmann area 25&quot;&gt;subcallosal cingulate&lt;/a&gt; white matter, which had been called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/26408865/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Literally.

These disappointing results were not surprising, since they were covered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neurotechreports.com/pages/publishersletterDec13.html&quot;&gt;Neurotech Business Report&lt;/a&gt; in December 2013 and then in depth by my posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/01/broaden-trial-of-dbs-for-treatment.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;BROADEN Trial of DBS for Treatment-Resistant Depression Halted by the FDA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/03/update-on-broaden-trial-of-dbs-for.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2015/03/update-on-broaden-trial-of-dbs-for.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The new paper followed the patients for a longer period of time, up to 24 months for some in the cohort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main portion of the trial was six months in length. All patients received implantation surgery. Two weeks later, they were randomized to either the treatment group (n=60), who received stimulation right away, or the “sham” control group (n=30), who did not. After six months, the blinding was uncovered and both sham and treatment groups were offered open label DBS for another six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the figure below, Control (red line) and Stimulation (blue line) groups both showed slight improvements over time, with no significant difference in depression severity measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). This was the primary endpoint. We don't see a difference between groups at six months or any other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BDd7kIGbqMk/WdyvKRgJHeI/AAAAAAAAMRw/hmd2FcTmo6o1_NRbJGHgS1jGg2YW_m1mQCLcBGAs/s1600/Mean%2BMADRS%2Bscore%2Bby%2Bstudy%2Bvisit.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;772&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1247&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BDd7kIGbqMk/WdyvKRgJHeI/AAAAAAAAMRw/hmd2FcTmo6o1_NRbJGHgS1jGg2YW_m1mQCLcBGAs/s400/Mean%2BMADRS%2Bscore%2Bby%2Bstudy%2Bvisit.png&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fig. 2.

I had erroneously stated in January 2014 that the trial was &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2014/01/broaden-trial-of-dbs-for-treatment.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;halted by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't. It was stopped by the sponsor, St. Jude Medical (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30371-1/fulltext&quot;&gt;Holtzheimer et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;For the futility analysis, based on the first 6 months' data, the  proportion of patients with response for the stimulation group was  predicted to be 40%, and for the control group was predicted to be  18·5%. In the actual futility analysis, these figures were 20% for the  stimulation group and 17% for the control group. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was concluded that the study had a 17% chance of success if continued. Although this did not meet the prespecified definition for futility (&amp;lt;10% chance of success), the sponsor chose to end study enrolment following the futility analysis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although “These findings are disappointing given the encouraging data from earlier open-label studies of subcallosal cingulate DBS,” all was not lost, according to the authors. They offered a number of possible explanations (which can be summarized as long duration of illness, suboptimal stimulation parameters, and lack of tractography):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“participants in this study had an average current episode duration of about 12 years, which is much longer than the average duration of current episode in previous studies of subcallosal cingulate DBS (approximately 5 years) and might have contributed to the low overall proportion of patients achieving a response.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“possible that stimulation contacts and parameters were suboptimal during the first 12 months of this study, given the somewhat restrictive programming algorithm used. Greater improvement in depression occurred after the 12-month endpoint when more flexibility in stimulation contacts and parameters was allowed.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Neurosurgical placement of the DBS electrodes, based on this algorithm, was highly accurate and did not differ between eventual responders and non-responders.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;[&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;placement was verified by at least two of three experts: HSM, CH, PEH. Nonetheless, the authors argue that placement could improve with more detailed tractography, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201759a.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Riva-Posse et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This refinement of protocol has been discussed for the last 10 years; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928332&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Johansen-Berg 2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2007/10/but-my-subgenual-cingulate-is-sad.html&quot;&gt;...But My Subgenual Cingulate Is Sad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“for maximal efficacy, the active electrode for subcallosal cingulate DBS must be placed such that it affects a crucial network of white matter tracts connecting key brain regions, including the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Therefore, it is possible that prospective targeting on the basis of individual diffusion tensor imaging tractography could optimise electrode placement in subcallosal cingulate DBS.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an earlier paper, a group of DBS investigators and ethics experts advised other researchers, industry mavens, and even bloggers on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159536&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Being open minded about neuromodulation trials: Finding success in our 'failures'&lt;/a&gt;.” (Finns et al., 2017)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Similarly, another randomized double blind clinical trial comparing active versus sham stimulation for the treatment of severe depression targeting Brodmann Area 25 was also halted for futility prior to completion of the planned study (St Jude Medical sponsored BROADEN trial). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;While there are neither publications nor official industry statements, uninformed speculations as to causes of the failure are in the public domain [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neurotechreports.com/pages/publishersletterDec13html&quot;&gt;28,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogsscientificamerican.com/cross-check/2014/03/11/much-hyped-brain-implant-treatment-for-depression-suffers-setback/&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;] to the detriment of the scientific process and progress.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each of these instances, different combinations of variables can lead to disappointing results. For example, patient characteristics, surgical variability, stimulation algorithms, outcome metrics, and institutional variance, can all contribute to negative outcomes in complex trials that initially seem promising. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;Further, once a negative report is published, the work can become ‘toxic’, and there is little incentive to engage in small subset analyses that have a limited market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Finally,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“We believe that investigators, industry, regulators and society need to fully understand what is casually described as success and failure in order to maximize return on investment, all the more so when opportunities for additional knowledge generation remain in place. To do otherwise, would be irresponsible.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to call the BROADEN trial a failure is “irresponsible”? Personally, I am aware that a multi-site trial using invasive new technology to treat intractable psychiatric patients with a terrible and (ultimately) ill-defined syndrome is a massive undertaking. And very, very, very expensive. I have no problem with the investigators trying to glean what they can  from individual differences to move forward with better  targets/parameters/etc. I wanted to see this procedure help a majority of patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is that the primary preregistered endpoint was as follows: 12/60 (20%) improved with stimulation, 5/30 (17%) improved with no stimulation, 8/60 (12%) patients with stimulation reported an &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in depressive symptoms (this was not defined or quantified), and 1/30 (3%) patients with no stimulation reported an &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in depressive symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's take a look at the registered clinical trial. Oh we can't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00617162&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Trial of device that is not approved or cleared by the U.S. FDA] -- Wow!

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/gd-4Tv5Y5dM/nature24467"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24467</id>
		<updated>2017-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;
 Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate cell-autonomous antimicrobial defenses1,2. Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative cytoplasmic free-living bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery3, encodes a repertoire of highly similar type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors called IpaHs4. IpaHs represent a large bacterial ubiquitin-ligase family5–8, but their function is poorly understood. Here we find that S. flexneri infection induced rapid proteasomal degradation of human GBP1 (hGBP1). A transposon screen identified ipaH9.8 as being responsible for the degradation. IpaH9.8 directly targeted hGBP1 for Lys48-linked ubiquitination. IpaH9.8 targeted multiple GBPs, which occurred in the cytoplasm independently of GBPs nucleotide-bound states as well as their differential function in antibacterial defence. When IpaH9.8 was absent or its binding to GBPs was disrupted, GBPs such as hGBP1 and mGBP2 translocated to intracellular S. flexneri to limit bacterial growth. IpaH9.8 targeting of GBPs promoted S. flexneri replication and caused lethality in mice. Gbpchr3-/- mice lacking several IpaH9.8-targeted GBPs succumbed to S. flexneri infection similarly to wild-type mice, but remained susceptible to ΔipaH9.8. The mode of IpaH9.8 action highlights the functional importance of GBPs in antibacterial defences. IpaH9.8 and S. flexneri provide a unique system for dissecting GBP-mediated immunity.

 This review commemorates the 40th anniversary of DNA sequencing, a period in which we have already witnessed multiple technological revolutions and a growth in scale from a few kilobases to the first human genome, and now to millions of human and a myriad of other genomes. DNA sequencing has been extensively and creatively repurposed, including as a ‘counter’ for a vast range of molecular phenomena. We predict that in the long view of history, the impact of DNA sequencing will be on a par with that of the microscope.

 Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans and are expected to contribute to individual disease risk. While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants. Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles, but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues, but their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44 human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p release. We find that 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8% of non-outliers. Additionally, we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes.

 &lt;p&gt;
 X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences transcription from one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is, however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of ‘escape’ from inactivation varying between genes and individuals. The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree to which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic survey of XCI, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues from GTEx (v6p release) and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic sequence data. We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape XCI with support from multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity. Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.

 Malaria transmission is influenced by climate, land use and deliberate interventions. Recent declines have been observed in malaria transmission. Here we show that the African continent has witnessed a long-term decline in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum from 40% prevalence in the period 1900–1929 to 24% prevalence in the period 2010–2015, a trend that has been interrupted by periods of rapidly increasing or decreasing transmission. The cycles and trend over the past 115 years are inconsistent with explanations in terms of climate or deliberate intervention alone. Previous global initiatives have had minor impacts on malaria transmission, and a historically unprecedented decline has been observed since 2000. However, there has been little change in the high transmission belt that covers large parts of West and Central Africa. Previous efforts to model the changing patterns of P. falciparum transmission intensity in Africa have been limited to the past 15 years or have used maps drawn from historical expert opinions. We provide quantitative data, from 50,424 surveys at 36,966 geocoded locations, that covers 115 years of malaria history in sub-Saharan Africa; inferring from these data to future trends, we would expect continued reductions in malaria transmission, punctuated with resurgences.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed of three members: TRPML1–TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3 gives rise to the varitint–waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes, inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel activation, and that it acts as a ‘gating pulley’ for lipid-dependent TRPML gating.

 Mouse embryonic stem cells derived from the epiblast contribute to the somatic lineages and the germline but are excluded from the extra-embryonic tissues that are derived from the trophectoderm and the primitive endoderm upon reintroduction to the blastocyst. Here we report that cultures of expanded potential stem cells can be established from individual eight-cell blastomeres, and by direct conversion of mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Remarkably, a single expanded potential stem cell can contribute both to the embryo proper and to the trophectoderm lineages in a chimaera assay. Bona fide trophoblast stem cell lines and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells can be directly derived from expanded potential stem cells in vitro. Molecular analyses of the epigenome and single-cell transcriptome reveal enrichment for blastomere-specific signature and a dynamic DNA methylome in expanded potential stem cells. The generation of mouse expanded potential stem cells highlights the feasibility of establishing expanded potential stem cells for other mammalian species.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Chromatin-remodelling factors change nucleosome positioning and facilitate DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The conserved remodelling factor chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 1(Chd1) can shift nucleosomes and induce regular nucleosome spacing. Chd1 is required for the passage of RNA polymerase IIthrough nucleosomes and for cellular pluripotency. Chd1 contains the DNA-binding domains SANT and SLIDE, a bilobal motor domain that hydrolyses ATP, and a regulatory double chromodomain. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Chd1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to a nucleosome at a resolution of 4.8 Å. Chd1 detaches two turns of DNA from the histone octamer and binds between the two DNA gyres in a state poised for catalysis. The SANT and SLIDE domains contact detached DNA around superhelical location (SHL) −7 of the first DNA gyre. The ATPase motor binds the second DNA gyre at SHL +2 and is anchored to the N-terminal tail of histone H4, as seen in a recent nucleosome–Snf2 ATPase structure. Comparisons with published results reveal that the double chromodomain swings towards nucleosomal DNA at SHL +1, resulting in ATPase closure. The ATPase can then promote translocation of DNA towards the nucleosome dyad, thereby loosening the first DNA gyre and remodelling the nucleosome. Translocation may involve ratcheting of the two lobes of the ATPase, which is trapped in a pre- or post-translocation state in the absence or presence, respectively, of transition state-mimicking compounds.

 Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in RNA molecules. Although many editing sites have recently been discovered, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the ADAR proteins. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex cis- and trans-regulation of A-to-I editing.

 Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a Ca2+-releasing cation channel that mediates the calcium signalling and homeostasis of lysosomes. Mutations in TRPML1 lead to mucolipidosis type IV, a severe lysosomal storage disorder. Here we report two electron cryo-microscopy structures of full-length human TRPML1: a 3.72-Å apo structure at pH 7.0 in the closed state, and a 3.49-Å agonist-bound structure at pH 6.0 in an open state. Several aromatic and hydrophobic residues in pore helix 1, helices S5 and S6, and helix S6 of a neighbouring subunit, form a hydrophobic cavity to house the agonist, suggesting a distinct agonist-binding site from that found in TRPV1, a TRP channel from a different subfamily. The opening of TRPML1 is associated with distinct dilations of its lower gate together with a slight structural movement of pore helix 1. Our work reveals the regulatory mechanism of TRPML channels, facilitates better understanding of TRP channel activation, and provides insights into the molecular basis of mucolipidosis type IV pathogenesis.

 Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a cation channel located within endosomal and lysosomal membranes. Ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, its loss-of-function mutations are the direct cause of type IV mucolipidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. Here we present the single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of the mouse TRPML1 channel embedded in nanodiscs. Combined with mutagenesis analysis, the TRPML1 structure reveals that phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) binds to the N terminus of the channel—distal from the pore—and the helix–turn–helix extension between segments S2 and S3 probably couples ligand binding to pore opening. The tightly packed selectivity filter contains multiple ion-binding sites, and the conserved acidic residues form the luminal Ca2+-blocking site that confers luminal pH and Ca2+ modulation on channel conductance. A luminal linker domain forms a fenestrated canopy atop the channel, providing several luminal ion passages to the pore and creating a negative electrostatic trap, with a preference for divalent cations, at the luminal entrance. The structure also reveals two equally distributed S4–S5 linker conformations in the closed channel, suggesting an S4–S5 linker-mediated PtdInsP2 gating mechanism among TRPML channels.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience show that location matters when it comes to brain cells’ gene expression, connections, and innervation area&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is composed of distinct regions that differ in their functional roles and cellular architecture. For example, the hippocampus is an area well-known for its involvement in memory and its dysfunction in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, while the neocortex is involved in functions such as perception, consciousness, and language. The hippocampus has a single, curved cell layer, while the neocortex has six, stacked layers. At the cellular level, although they share canonical types of inhibitory interneurons (INs) and excitatory principal neurons (PNs), it remains largely unknown to what extent a single type in different brain regions displays similarity in gene expression, axonal shape, connectivity, and developmental origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To approach this problem, researchers in the laboratory of Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), took advantage of a unique class of INs called chandelier cells. As their name suggests, these neurons have a distinctive, chandelier-like shape. Most importantly, when their axonal processes stretch out and connect to neighboring cells, they almost always do so at the same location on that neuron – the axon initial segment – and nowhere else. These powerful inhibitory connections control the output of hundreds of neighboring excitatory PNs. These stereotypical features and the fact that chandelier cells are present in both the hippocampus and the neocortex make them an ideal model to study regional differences in a single canonical neuronal type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize different cell types in the brain, researchers often need genetic access to that cell – the ability to express a gene of interest only in, say, chandelier cells, but not neighboring neurons. Years ago, Taniguchi developed a method for studying chandelier cells in the neocortex, but access to those in the hippocampus has remained elusive. Two postdoctoral researchers in Taniguchi’s lab, Yugo Ishino, Ph.D. and Michael Yetman, Ph.D., followed in his footsteps, painstakingly screening molecules until they found one that was reliably expressed in hippocampal chandelier cells – cadherin 6. Luckily, a mouse model already existed that allowed the team to take advantage of this gene expression and use it to compare the two cell populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the ability to compare these two populations, the team found that chandelier cells in the hippocampus expand twice the size of axonal arbors in the neocortex and made twice as many connections as their counterparts. Additionally, the hippocampal chandelier cells were born several days earlier during embryonic development than the neocortical ones. Lastly, the team identified a gene, calretinin, in the hippocampal cells which was not expressed in the neocortical cells – suggesting the possibility that these cells exhibit different functional properties as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists wondered what factors determined regional differences in these cells’ characteristics. Were the traits predetermined by genes that were set at the start of the cell’s life? Or did the environment in which they ‘grew up’ have a stronger influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question of nature versus nurture, the researchers took cells that would grow to become chandelier cells in the hippocampus and transplanted them into the neocortex, and took cells that would grow to become neocortical chandelier cells and transplanted them to the hippocampus. Each ended up taking on the characteristics of its new neighbors, implying that the environment that they grew up in strongly influenced the fate of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, Taniguchi explained, show that exquisite modifications of canonical neuronal types in different brain regions may contribute to their functional diversification. Future studies should elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which regional environment controls phenotypic variations of neuronal types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the novel genetic access to hippocampal chandelier cells developed in the Taniguchi Lab at MPFI, neuroscientists can begin asking questions about the function of these cells within learning and memory circuits. The ability to manipulate specific genes within these hippocampal chandelier cells may allow for more meticulous studies of several diseases, including epilepsy and schizophrenia, in which these neurons have been implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Not long ago, Zika virus was dominating headlines. A new infection was hardly ever heard about before then, yet is now affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Latin America, causing disfiguration and microcephalia in new-born babies. Microcephalia is caused by severe delayed and abnormal development of the brain, resulting in the range of intellectual disability, dwarfism, poor motor functions and speech. With no cure or even preventive vaccination available, many women in the most affected regions were reportedly considering postponing any planned pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was actually discovered back in 1947 in Zika forest in Uganda (and this is where its name comes from). The pathogen is related to better known viruses causing dengue and yellow fever. The disease is spread predominantly by one type of mosquito and was a rare occurrence until the epidemics of 2015–2016, when in Brazil alone well over 100,000 cases were reported. The disease caused particular concern as it coincided with the run-up to the 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from mosquitoes, the virus can be spread through sexual contact and from mother to child during &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/12/top-pregnancy-and-labor-apps/&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; or at delivery. The latter way of transmission is a particular concern: while adults suffer only very mild symptoms (fever and rush), children infected during pregnancy suffer major &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/&quot;&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that viral infection delays brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research identified a more specific reason: Zika virus specifically targets neural progenitor cells, the cells responsible for production of other neurons. This is what makes the virus very dangerous for the developing fetus. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/&quot;&gt;Neuron progenitor cells&lt;/a&gt; are abundant in the developing fetal brain. However, only a few are left in the brain of adults. In adults with completely formed brain, Zika virus infection causes only mild symptoms, if any (Zika fever). But the specificity with which the virus targets neural progenitor cells gave researchers an idea that might revolutionize the treatment of one of the deadliest types of brain cancer—glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat, with patients rarely surviving even one year after diagnosis. Unfortunately, this is also one of the most common types of brain cancer. Approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with glioblastoma in the US alone. The quick return of the disease even after aggressive surgery is caused by the survival of a few glioblastoma stem cells. Many  types of cancer like glioblastoma grow due to the existence of cancer stem cells that give rise to other tumor cells. The glioblastoma stem cells remain almost unaffected by all radio- and chemotherapy regiments currently used to treat this malignancy, even though these therapeutic approaches do kill other cells in the tumor. They also successfully avoid detection and elimination by the immune system, allowing the regrowth of cancer in a short period of time after surgery, replenishing the cancer cells eliminated by therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that glioblastoma stem cells are, in many ways, very similar to normal neural progenitor cells. Therefore, infecting a person with glioblastoma with Zika virus might help in treating the disease by eliminating the stem cells. This was a core idea that researchers initially tested on cancer cells from tumors obtained from surgeries. It turned out that the virus does indeed kill cancer stem cells, leaving other cancer cells almost unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further make sure that the virus doesn’t affect the normal cells of the brain, scientists have performed experiments on brain tissues from patients with epilepsy. The tests did not detect any damage to these cells due to viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that combining traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/&quot;&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; with treatment with Zika virus may help to eliminate stem and non-stem cancer cells. Such an outcome will most certainly be beneficial for the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the idea further, scientists injected Zika virus directly into the brain of mice with brain tumors. In all animals infected with the disease, tumor growth slowed down significantly and the animals survived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that Zika virus can be injected into the brain of a glioblastoma patient at the time of surgery. The subsequent chemotherapy will remove any remaining cancer cells that survived surgery, and Zika virus will kill the residual glioblastoma stem cells. The published findings also suggest that the virus can be further engineered to be more easily eliminated from normal healthy brain cells using the patient’s immune system. Less harmful strains of the virus have already been developed to this end and have demonstrated some success in animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if a successful therapeutic approach to treat deadly glioblastoma can be developed using Zika virus. The path to future use of Zika-based treatment in hospitals will likely be long. The original results, however, are very encouraging. This new approach is another fascinating example of a growing number of new innovative tools that are currently being developed to treat a variety of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2017-10-07T13:19:10+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;I taught another &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom&quot;&gt;Fedora Classroom&lt;/a&gt; this week, on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2017-10-05/fedora-classroom.2017-10-05-14.17.log.html&quot;&gt;Git 101&lt;/a&gt;. I used the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;
again since this session was to be another hands-on walkthrough. I reckon I've
now learned that hands-on sessions go on longer than initially planned. This
one lasted about three hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;some-metrics&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: 3 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees: ~25 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentences spoken: LOTS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't go much into the theory, and there's a lot of it in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I
had made it my goal to walk the attendees through the usual &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; workflow.
So, that's exactly what we did. We started by setting up an empty repository,
then added files to it, learned how to see changes and so on. Then, we moved
on to branching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd explored the advantages of using branches we started working with
remotes. Everyone set up repositories on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. To end with, I
got everyone to fork my repository and submit pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone got the hang of it. There were some good questions, a bit of
discussion too. I do hope it'll get more people to use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to
different projects on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io&quot;&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;feedback-is-always-welcome&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback is always welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some
feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#fedora-classroom on Freenode &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23fedora-classroom&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback
privately. I'm FranciscoD on quite a few Fedora IRC channels, and I can be
reached via e-mail on my Fedora address at ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org.
All suggestions, comments, criticism is most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;more-instructors-needed&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More instructors needed!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classroom sessions are going rather well, but &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Help_wanted&quot;&gt;we still need more help&lt;/a&gt;. We'd like to cover
more topics from different areas, not just tech related- everything from
design, to free software philosophy and community building! If there's anything
at all you think is worth a classroom session, please get in touch with the
team on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Fedora classroom mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. A log of all past sessions -
whether on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; or on a video platform are maintained on the wiki page &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Previous_Sessions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for everyone to
peruse at their convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s a growing trend of healthy young men using medications like Viagra and Cialis, drugs intended for older men and those with health-related erectile dysfunction (ED).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these young men (unknowingly?) use these drugs to treat a condition that is psychological rather than physiological: porn-induced &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/07/30/vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-its-neurological-consequences/&quot;&gt;erectile dysfunction &lt;/a&gt;(PEID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online social groups and websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainonporn.com/&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Porn&lt;/a&gt; and Reddit’s “no fap” group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/&lt;/a&gt;) were founded to help men with PIED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, studies that checked for a connection between watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;porn&lt;/a&gt; and erectile dysfunction found no evidence associating the two. If that’s the case, what explains the sharp rise in ED cases in young men in recent years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B8-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;Swiss researchers&lt;/a&gt; used the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), finding an ED rate of 30% in a cross-section of Swiss men aged 18 to 24. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039517/#B9-behavsci-06-00017&quot;&gt;2013 Italian study&lt;/a&gt; reported that one in four patients who sought help for new-onset ED were younger than 40, with rates of severe ED nearly 10% higher than in men over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Takeesha Roland-Jenkins (MS in psychology and MS in neurology) a professional consultant for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betweenusclinic.com&quot;&gt;Between Us Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, to weigh in. Takeesha is an expert in both psychology and neurology, and she has a unique insight into both the psyche and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your opinion, can excessive porn consumption really cause a man to experience erectile dysfunction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, watching hardcore porn excessively, especially pornography with deviant and violent behavior can cause mental changes that may result in erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in a man’s brain when he is exposed to extreme sexual stimuli (such as hardcore pornography) and how does this relate to ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardcore pornography is often graphic and generally displays deviant, violent, and abnormally kinky behavior. This is not typical for the average sexual encounter and it can create unrealistic mental perceptions of how a man should engage in sexual activity. Furthermore, a man may initially get a thrill from watching what he believes is an exotic encounter, but over time excessive porn watching desensitizes men to intense sexual stimuli and even sexual violence which sometimes occurs in the porn that is being viewed, thereby lowering the ability to engage in true intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornography, in general, causes intense mental stimulation that changes the way the brain views sexual activity and sexual violence in pornography exaggerates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/03/the-truth-about-porn-shrinking-your-brain/&quot;&gt;alterations in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is similar to becoming more tolerant to a certain drug after prolonged use; meaning you eventually need higher and higher doses to experience the same feelings of euphoria. Repeatedly watching hard-core porn can have a similar effect on sexual performance. In other words, watching excessive porn changes the way the brain processes sexual arousal and activity, often leading to desensitization that lowers libido and causes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betweenusclinic.com/mental-impotence/psychological-impotence-diagnosis-causes-and-treatments/&quot;&gt;psychological erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some say that men who watch too much porn can develop performance anxiety. Why does anxiety affect the ability to get and maintain an erection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because a man’s brain has now become accustomed to getting stimulated at the sight of intense pornographic images, an ordinary encounter will cause the man to wonder if he will be able to perform at a similar level (e.g., for extended periods) as what has been observed in a pornographic video. Therefore, the performance anxiety is still related to the changes that occur in the brain and wondering if he can satisfy his partner in the manner that the brain has become used to. In other words, the anxiety is a direct result of worrying about being able to re-enact the sexual scenes in porn; this unrealistic goal can lead to performance anxiety. Subsequently, a man may get an erection, but after beginning to worry about whether he can perform like the actors in porn, the erection may soften or stop altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, other than performance anxiety, is there another reason why porn could cause men to experience ED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes that occur in the brain’s ability to lead to an erection contributes more to PIED than performance anxiety. Over time the brain needs increasing levels of stimulation from the pornography in order to initiate an erection. Performance anxiety can unfortunately worsen erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does porn-induced erectile dysfunction cure itself if the man stops watching porn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discontinuing pornographic viewing does not automatically cure PIED. Furthermore, drugs such as Viagra or Cialis target the physical aspect of erectile dysfunction, not the psychological aspect. This means that a man will become completely dependent upon such drugs until the brain restores its ability to initiate an erection under ordinary sexual circumstances. A healthy relationship (e.g., marriage) with a patient partner can help a man overcome PIED over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What form of treatment would you recommend a man who suffers from PIED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneficial treatment would be in the form of individualized therapy, which may vary in time (e.g., weeks, months) depending on the individual and the degree of PIED. As PIED is often the result of an addiction to pornography, this form of treatment should be viewed as the first step to addiction recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of therapy is to begin to desensitize the brain to the pornographic images and to address some of the reasons that the addiction to porn more than likely started. Men are also encouraged to reconnect intimately with their partners in order to help the brain restore its ability to initiate sexual arousal during ordinary sexual encounters. Overall, a man must be willing to give himself time to gradually overcome PIED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
