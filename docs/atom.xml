&lt;p&gt;What if you could take a psychedelic drug regularly in such tiny quantities that the immediate effects were not discernible, yet over time it led to a range of psychological benefits, especially enhanced focus and heightened creativity? That’s the principle behind “microdosing” – a controversial technique that’s exploded in popularity ever since the publication of a 2011 book &lt;em&gt;The Psychedelic Explorers Guide&lt;/em&gt; and a 2015 Rolling Stone article titled &lt;em&gt;How LSD Microdosing Became The Hot New Business Trip&lt;/em&gt;. Large online communities of microdosing enthusiasts have since emerged on sites like Reddit, where dosing tips are shared and the supposed manifold benefits of the practice are espoused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, actual scientific investigations into the effects of microdosing can be counted on one hand. Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211023#sec003&quot;&gt;one of the few systematic investigations ever conducted into the practice&lt;/a&gt;, by Vince Polito and Richard Stevenson at Macquarie University. Though exploratory and tentative due to “legal and bureaucratic” obstacles (meaning there was no placebo control or randomisation in this research), the results suggest that microdosing can be beneficial, although not in the ways that users most expect, and not necessarily for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37159&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited hundreds of volunteers from Reddit.com/r/microdosing and other online psychedelic groups (people with mental health problems were asked not to take part). The participants completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires at baseline tapping nine domains of functioning including personality, mental health and wellbeing; then for six weeks they reported daily any microdosing they’d engaged in the previous day, and provided brief daily ratings (of how they’d felt the previous day) regarding various psychological measures. Finally, at the study end, they completed the same battery of tests as at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufficiently complete data was obtained from 63 mentally well participants who, during the study, engaged in microdosing of a serotonergic psychedelic (a substance, most commonly LSD or magic mushrooms/psilocybin, that acts on the functioning of the brain chemical serotonin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the daily ratings, on days that participants had microdosed, they scored higher than usual across all the measures: connectedness, contemplation, creativity, focus, happiness, productiveness, and wellbeing. However, only focus and productivity showed slight, sustained increases on the drug-free days that followed microdosing. “The pattern of results here is somewhat inconsistent with narrative accounts that claim that the effects of microdosing linger for multiple days,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most of the more in-depth battery of measures taken at the study start and end, participants did not show any change. However, they did display reductions in stress, depression and mind-wandering, alongside greater absorption (experiencing intense imaginative experiences and “peak-like altered states of consciousness”). A final change that surprised the researchers was a slight increase in trait neuroticism (i.e. greater emotional instability), which they speculated may have been due to an overall increase in emotional intensity, positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last finding regarding increased neuroticism was reflected in some of the participants’ open-ended descriptions at the study debrief: “&lt;em&gt;…another negative is that all emotions get amplified. So whenever I feel down or not loved the microdose makes it even harder,&lt;/em&gt;” wrote one volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major drawback of a study such as this, in which participants knew which substance they had taken and there was no placebo group, is that the reported effects may simply have been a result of participants’ expectations or their imagination. To gain insight into this possibility, the researchers conducted a second study with hundreds more participants from online microdosing communities, and this time asked them to say how they thought they would change on the same various psychological measures used in the first study, if they were to microdose for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast with the first study’s results, these participants predicted that after six weeks microdosing they would change on all the psychological measures. Although most of their predictions were for change in the same direction as the limited changes that were actually observed in the first study, these participants’ strongest predictions were for increases in creativity, wellbeing and mindfulness (in line with the positive media coverage of microdosing and generally positive chat in online forums), but in fact none of these variables increased over the course of the first study. Also, these participants predicted that neuroticism would decrease, when it actually increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the predictions of participants in the second study did not match the actual reported experiences of those in the first, argues against the experiences of the first group of participants being driven purely by their expectations and hopes. The mostly positive effects reported also chime with the findings from more controlled research of larger doses of psychedelics, which have mostly been positive. However, the researchers also noted that they did not observe a dose-response effect in the first study (there was no correlation between the doses the participants reported taking and the psychological effects), which is surprising, and “is a reason to interpret these findings cautiously,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Polito and Stevenson said their tentative findings suggested several “disconnects” between media coverage and anecdotal chat around the effects of microdosing and actual experiences of microdosers as recorded systematically in this research. In particular, effects mostly did not seem to linger on non-dosing days, and the main changes over the course of the study were not in productivity and creativity as is commonly claimed, but “mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that their “most surprising” finding was the observed increase in neuroticism, especially considered in light of the handful of open-ended descriptions of negative experiences. “In a context of considerable hype around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to its potential as a business tool, it is important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211023#sec003&quot;&gt;A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 119&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5929&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-4.34.07-pm-300x160.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 120&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grey matter thins as connections are refined&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 121&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More white matter enables faster communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 122&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their &lt;em&gt;‘rational PFC’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;‘emotional limbic brain’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 127&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, &lt;em&gt;‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’&lt;/em&gt; That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, &lt;em&gt;‘They hate me. I’m going home!’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, &lt;em&gt;‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’&lt;/em&gt; The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, &lt;em&gt;‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,&lt;/em&gt; or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, &lt;em&gt;‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Many emotions girls experience are novel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 129&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran's journal club session, where he will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650214000509&quot;&gt;Magnetic-inspired optimization algorithms Operators and structures (M.-H. Tayarani-N., M.-R. Akbarzadeh-T, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel optimization algorithm, called the Magnetic Optimization Algorithms (MOAs), is proposed in this paper which is inspired by the principles of magnetic field theory. In MOA, the possible solutions are some magnetic particles scattered in the search space. In this respect, each magnetic particle has a measure of mass and magnetic field according to its fitness. In this scheme, the fitter magnetic particles are more massive, with stronger magnetic field. In terms of interaction, these particles are located in a structured population and apply a long range force of attraction to their neighbors. Ten different structures are proposed for the algorithm and the structure that offers the best performance is found. Also, to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm, several operators are proposed: a repulsive short-range force, an explosion operator, a combination of short-range force and explosion operator and a crossover interaction between the neighboring particles. In order to test the proposed algorithm and the proposed operators, the algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms on 21 numerical benchmark functions. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the existing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yi Sun's journal club session, where she will present the paper &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=WE3SzeVEvDkC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR5&amp;amp;dq=%5B1%5D+Ramsay,+J.+O.+and+Silverman+B.W.:+Applied+Functional+Data+Analysis:+Methods+and+Case+Studies,+New+York:+Springer-Verlag,+2002.+Chapter+6+and+Chapter+7&amp;amp;ots=WPBFyEy6Io&amp;amp;sig=Emt7blkjWVVXl57sS2qzg3TxDV8#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Applied Functional Data Analysis Methods and Case Studies (Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman B.W, 2002)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has seen rapid development over the last two decades. FDA refers to a collection of methods for analysing data over a curve, surface or continuum. It is very much involved with computational statistics. FDA has been applied to quite broadly in medicine, business and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Yi will introduce the basic idea of FDA using a case study presented in the paper: zooming in on human growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human growth is not at all the simple process that one might imagine at first sight… Collecting records is time-consuming and expensive, because children have to be measured accurately and tracked for a long period of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We] consider how to make this sort of record into a useful functional datum to incorporate into further analyses. A smooth curve drawn through the points is commonly called a growth curve, but growth is actually the rate of increase of the height of the child. In children this is necessarily positive… [We] develop a monotone smoothing method that takes this sort of consideration into account and yields a functional datum that picks out important stages in a child’s growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that science has a diversity problem, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/women-science&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/blacks-in-stem-jobs-are-especially-concerned-about-diversity-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/&quot;&gt;members of minority groups&lt;/a&gt; being underrepresented. A new study suggests a solution aimed at children – reframing science as something that people do, rather than something that defines their identity, can reduce the potentially off-putting impact of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.21231&quot;&gt;“white male” scientist stereotype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12837&quot;&gt;published recently in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thoughtful use of language encourages greater interest in science among young children – and makes them less likely to lose confidence in their scientific abilities as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37148&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Lei and colleagues recruited 212 children in 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; grade (about 7-9 years old) at two diverse publicly funded schools in New York City. The kids were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group always received “identity-focused” language about science (that implied that&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;scientists are a specific category of people), while the other always received “action-focused” language (that implied science is an activity that anyone can do).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the beginning of the study the kids saw a video that introduced them to the scientific process. For the identity-focused group, the narrator of the video used phrases like “scientists make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”. The action-focused group, on the other hand, heard language like “when people do science, they make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At three points across the academic year, the children answered questions measuring their attitudes towards science, including their levels of interest (either how much they wanted to “be a scientist” or “do science”, depending on the group they were in), and how good they thought they’d be (either at “being a scientist” or “doing science”). At the second and third testing points, they were also asked to judge how many parents of other children at school “were scientists” or “did science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the children in the action-focused group had a greater interest in “doing science” than those in the identity-focussed group had in “being a scientist”. The action-focused group also rated themselves higher in their scientific abilities, and they thought that more adults “did science” compared with how many people the identity group thought “were scientists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the year, as the children got older, their interest in science and belief in their own abilities decreased. But the kind of language they had received was important: children in the action-focused group didn’t show a decrease in self-belief, unlike the children in the identity-focused group. In part, this effect seemed to be because the action group believed more adults in their community were doing science. “The benefit of action‐focused language partly occurred because children have more inclusive representations of who they think can ‘do science’ than of who can ‘be a scientist’”, write the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that language can have a big impact on how kids’ views of science develop through childhood. This is important, say the authors, because in schools and the media labels like “scientist” are common. The study suggests that teachers should reframe discussions to talk about “doing science” instead.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This careful use of language could be particularly useful to encourage interest in science amongst those who might not see themselves as fitting the stereotype of a scientist – although interestingly, a supplementary analysis didn’t actually find any differences in the effect of the action/identity framing between boys and girls, or those of different ethnic backgrounds. The authors suggest the study may have too few participants to detect those kinds of differences – this is an important area for future, larger studies to consider.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12837&quot;&gt;Children lose confidence in their potential to “be scientists”, but not in their capacity to “do science”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AR is the overlaying of virtual content on a user’s view of the real world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mkwi2018.leuphana.de/wp-content/uploads/MKWI_219.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cases&lt;/a&gt; supporting the use of AR smart glasses exist if an application is needed to be timely, mobile, and hands-free and continuous attention on the task is necessary. For example, in maintenance a worker could use a smart glass with a live-streaming feature to get advice of technicians, including watching demonstrations, while doing the work. Because of the novelty of AR applications, we find ourselves at an interesting waypoint in the process of finding further use cases for AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why think about Augmented Reality in nursing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nursing is an interesting field in which to apply AR, as nurses often have to work quickly, stay mobile, and have both their hands available for their work. Furthermore, new challenges in the nursing field, such as demographical change and rising multimorbidity, invite the use of new technologies. Technical solutions and social innovation may improve healthcare; however, it is important to take the special circumstances of care workers into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overviews regarding use cases of AR have been published for various fields. As there was no systematic review about AR in nursing, it was the logical step to conduct this work ourselves. With the review we aimed to gain insights to the following research question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To date, what research has been performed regarding the use of AR in nursing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodical challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we had a broad research question without concrete output categories, in the beginning we were not able to conduct a systematic review. Thus, we started looking for a type of review which allowed identifying relevant result categories during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New use cases for AR in nursing … will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, addressing the study quality was a challenging task. To date only a few studies on AR in nursing exist. Therefore, we decided to include studies of varying quality. Finally, we decided to conduct a scoping review. This review type allows the kinds of freedom we needed to identify relevant topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we followed the guidelines for scoping reviews, we still faced the task of identifying relevant topics inductively. To get an overview about topics mentioned in the studies we used a mindmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-019-0342-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We found&lt;/a&gt; 23 studies identifying use cases for AR in nursing. Use cases for AR in nursing focus on specific fields of use, and use case identification and requirements elicitation were often not described in detail. In addition, we identified that the results of studies evaluating AR in nursing were predominantly positive; however, several technical challenges were described for most of these devices. Moreover, most applications could be identified as prototypes in an early stage of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings in which the studies operated are noteworthy. While twelve studies could be grouped into a broad clinical setting with variation in use cases, eleven studies were set in the field of nursing education. We found that many studies focused on obtaining knowledge on the applications developed instead of the effects of technology inclusion on nursing. No studies questioned the clinical relevance of their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering context while evaluating applications would be an important goal for future research. This could be achieved through performing field trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future development trends, we infer that further technological advances will lead to new use cases for AR in nursing. These may be developed rapidly and will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we use the findings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arinflex.de&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consortium project&lt;/a&gt;, we had the aim to develop applications of AR in nursing. Thus, we needed an overview regarding existing developments. We have already used the results of our review, along with additional &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/48266&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;, to design and evaluate prototypes for applications in the fields of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/50054&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wound care management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/4438&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hand hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve been transported deep beneath the earth into a labyrinth of tunnels. You have a sword and a communications device, and your objective is to return to the surface. A figure appears in the dark ahead of you. Do you: (a) Use your communication device to say hello; (b) Formulate a contingency plan for escape and then approach the figure; or (c) Pause a moment to try to read its body language before stepping forward to approach the figure? &lt;/em&gt;[to interpret your preference, see end of post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personality traits are traits are traditionally assessed by asking people to rate how much various descriptive statements match their own personality, like “I enjoy talking to strangers”. This cheap and easy approach has enjoyed great success – people’s scores on such tests tend to be impressively consistent over time, and they predict important outcomes from health to career success. However, the questionnaires are far from perfect. Research volunteers might not properly engage out of boredom, for instance. Job candidates might deliberately fake their scores to give a favourable impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting possibility for overcoming these issues, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886919301266?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; is to use a “gamification” approach – present people with behavioural options in engaging game-like scenarios and deduce their personality traits from their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37137&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the gamification approach to personality testing, John-Luke McCord at Louisiana State University and his colleagues consulted 11 personality psychology experts to help develop their tunnel-based game scenario. They ended up with 27 choice situations with the various options carefully worded to reflect the likely preferences of high scorers in the main “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then recruited 77 volunteers on Reddit (r/SampleSize) and had them work their way through the game and also complete an established questionnaire based method of assessing the Big Five traits, the IPIP-50. Based on the results, they tweaked the game and in a follow-up study gave the revised version to 98 undergrads, who also took the IPIP-50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining results from these two studies showed that participants’ trait scores based on their game choices correlated moderately with their trait scores as ascertained from the established personality questionnaire. This was true for all five main traits, with the correlation being weakest for openness (correlation was 0.14) and highest for extraversion (0.41).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team tried to obtain higher correlations between the game scores and questionnaire scores by trying out a new version of the game with more Reddit volunteers, this time with the choice options in each scenario worded to reflect different levels of one specific trait (more or less extraversion, for instance, rather than interpreting the choices as reflecting the influence of different traits). The game scores correlated with the questionnaire scores for all traits, except conscientiousness, perhaps because all players, regardless of their own personality, recognised the most conscientious option as optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection, however, McCord and his team said that perhaps they were barking up the wrong tree by trying to make the game and questionnaire results correlate as highly as possible, “as the ultimate goal is to accurately measure personality, not perfectly reflect an existing measure.” As their core motivation is to create a more realistic measure of personality (and especially personality-driven decision making), they added that it might be better to evaluate their game “with field studies or naturalistic observations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper was intended as a proof of concept, which the researchers believe they’ve achieved. Further refinement and a more technologically complex game could provide an even more accurate and realistic way to measure personality. “We believe that the future of game-like personality testing has promising potential for both research and practice,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886919301266?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Game-like personality testing: An emerging mode of personality assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting the scenario options&lt;/strong&gt;: The researchers say that choosing (a) would indicate higher trait extraversion; choosing (b) would indicate higher trait conscientiousness; and (c) would be taken as a sign of openness. My own preference – to immediately leg it in the opposite direction – is not given as an option, but would presumably reflect high trait neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses plays a principal role in learning in the cerebellum, which acts as a supervised learning machine. Recent experiments demonstrate various forms of synaptic plasticity at different sites within the cerebellum. In this article, we take into consideration synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses as well as at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and propose that the cerebellar cortex performs reinforcement learning, another form of learning that is more capable than supervised learning. We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You spend about 10 per cent of your waking hours with your eyes shut, simply because of blinking. Every few seconds, each time you blink, your retinas are deprived of visual input for a period lasting anywhere between tens to hundreds of milliseconds (500 milliseconds is equivalent to half a second). You don’t usually notice this, because your brain suppresses the dark spells and stitches together the bursts of visual information seamlessly. But these dips in visual processing in the brain do have an impact: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619842198&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; finds that, in an important way, they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37130&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how we perceive the passing of time has not been established, and just how important ongoing sensory processing might be is debated. The new work confirms that visual processing has an influence. “In finding that we lose time when we blink, we essentially can draw a link between early ongoing visual processing and the sense of time,” says Ayelet Landau at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, senior author on the study.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laundau and her colleagues, including first author Shany Grossman at the Weizmann Institute of Science, recruited 22 participant to complete a visual challenge, while 23 others completed an auditory task.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the visual challenge started, the participants were first shown a white circle for either a “short” period (0.6 seconds) or a “long” period (2.8 seconds). Then came the actual challenge – they were shown a white circle on a screen for varying periods of time, and asked to judge whether the duration of each appearance was closer to the “short” or “long” period. The participants in the auditory group took part in a similar challenge, except that they had to judge the durations of bursts of white noise. For both groups, a video-based eye tracker continuously measured their eye position and pupil diameter throughout the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ judgments during the visual task showed how blinks affect our sense of time. Specifically, participants underestimated the duration of the white circle’s appearance if they blinked while they were watching it. What’s more, for each individual, the duration of this blink correlated with their degree of time under-estimation. There was, as the researchers write, “a proportional relation between the objective duration of sensory-input loss and the loss of subjective time.” These results, they go on, can be interpreted as “supporting a central role for ongoing sensory encoding in the subjective sense of time.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the auditory group, in contrast, blinking had no impact on their judgements of noise durations.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, we often use many senses to process what’s going on. If we’re watching someone talking while listening to them, for example, would blinking have any effect on our perception of how long they spoke for? This kind of work has yet to be done. “One possibility is that during periods of missing information from one sense, only information flow in the other sense will take over our sense of time,” Landau suggests. “Another option is that if one sense is more highly weighted by the brain — as is the case for vision in watching a person speak — subjective time will rely primarily on this sense and will therefore be distorted by information loss in this sense.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study raises all kinds of fascinating questions for future research to investigate. Right now, I’m sitting at my desk, focusing on my computer screen — relying heavily on vision. Yes, I’m absorbed in what I’m doing. But is one reason why time seems to go more quickly when I’m working because my blinks are affecting my judgements of time passing, but when I’m outside, hanging out with my kids, other types of sensory input are preventing or counteracting the time-compressing blink-effect?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team is currently planning studies to investigate how multi-sensory processing impacts subjective time — so watch this space. But, “we would expect subjective time to be primarily informed by the sense we are [currently] focusing on,” Landau says.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: other ingenious studies have shown that it’s not the lack of stimulation of the retina, per se, that will alter time perception, but rather the dampening of activity in the visual cortex – a process triggered automatically by involuntary blinking (and which contributes to our seamless visual experience). This means that, should you wish to suspend time deliberately, opening and closing your eyes on purpose will not have the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619842198&quot;&gt;Where Does Time Go When You Blink?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Tomasz Witkowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the latest epidemiological data, it could be argued that we are in the midst of a pandemic of mental illness, of dimensions never before seen in human history. The WHO estimates that over 350 million people around the world are presently suffering from depression, which constitutes almost 5-6 per cent of the population. At its extreme, depression may lead to suicide, by which it is estimated that around 1 million people die every year. And the numbers continue growing. Faced with this rising tide of illness, it is impossible to overestimate the importance of hard facts and data indicating the paths researchers and clinicians may follow in search of ways to help. Sometimes, as suggested by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/23/after-half-a-century-of-research-psychology-cant-predict-suicidal-behaviours-better-than-by-coin-flip/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis of 50 years of studies on indicators that help predict suicide attempts&lt;/a&gt;, we are entirely helpless. In other cases, like with the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/06/this-is-how-psychotherapy-for-depression-changes-the-brain/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis of the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy in depressed brains&lt;/a&gt;, study results do bring us hope.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300247&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis of biological markers evaluated in randomized trials of psychological treatments for depression&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/i&gt; are another attempt at understanding methods of treating this terrifying illness. The authors – Ioana A. Cristea, Eirini Karyotaki, Steven D. Hollon, Pim Cuijpers and Claudio Gentili – quite rightly point out that understanding how psychological interventions impact or are impacted by biological variables has important implications. For many people, their depression co-occurs with a bodily illness, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and immune system and neurological disorders, and at times is a consequence of that illness. Although we still know little about the reciprocal cause-and-effect mechanisms between psychic and somatic symptoms, some studies have suggested that psychological interventions not only change mood, but also normalise the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, with a therapeutic effect on physical conditions, such as heart disease. But is this really true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37124&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors analysed fifty-one trials (5,123 adult participants; over half with a somatic disorder alongside depression) where biological markers such as glycemic control, cortisol concentration after-wake, immunological, neurobiological, inflammatory, weight and blood pressure were outcomes (in 43 studies) and/or predictors of treatment response (9 studies). In fact, only one-fifth of the trials reported statistically significant physiological benefits of a psychological intervention over control, and where present, such benefits were restricted to a tiny fraction of the total variables assessed. Although statistically significant, these limited positive effects were very weak. For measures related to glycemic control and cortisol concentration, psychotherapy did not outperform the controls at all.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results contradict the broadly held belief that psychotherapy impacts biology. There may be many reasons for this contradiction, but a likely one is that the belief came about on the basis of purely observational evidence (the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is measured almost exclusively with patients’ self-reports or clinician-rated scales, assessing symptoms or other subjective outcomes, and it’s possible these subjective ratings have given an exaggerated impression of the biological impact of psychotherapy).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors believe their failure to uncover evidence for psychotherapy having biological effects is most likely due primarily to methodological inconsistencies between studies (there was large variability across the biological domains and markers explored and overall findings were mixed), or to the confounding factors, such as placebo effects, that are so characteristic of studies on the biology of psychological illness. If they are correct, then in time, once researchers solidify their methodology, this will deliver new results that confirm the general belief in the beneficial effect of psychotherapy on disruptions to human biological functioning. However, if the researchers’ explanation is untrue, then the results of their new meta-analysis give rise to very fundamental doubts and questions: Is the dogma of psychophysical unity, presently accepted in contemporary psychology and medicine, correct? Is it possible that any associations which occur are of a solely unidirectional nature (biology modifies our mental states, but not the reverse)? And finally, perhaps the most banal question that would render the others meaningless: is it possible that the belief in psychotherapy’s capacity to alter biological functions in our bodies is nothing more than the product of marketing and hype?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking the answers to these questions, it is worth examining the manner in which particular types of psychotherapy came about. Were they created and modified on the basis of analysis of feedback (such as biomarkers) supplied by patients’ bodies? And if not, perhaps the issue is not with the methodological imperfections of studies looking for biological effects, but rather in the ways that psychotherapies are developed? To find answers to these questions, we have to analyse the methods that are used to shape psychotherapeutic interventions in the first place.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To many, the statement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Religion causes violence” seems intuitively true. After all, one can easily summon to mind a huge number of examples, from the Crusades to warfare connected with early Islam, to the September 11th attacks and sectarian warfare in the Middle East, and on and on and on. Some liberal-minded people, particularly those of an atheist bent, will rattle off these examples as clear proof that religion is a force for evil in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But what if it’s more complicated than that? What if there’s less evidence than one might think that religion causes violence? That’s the provocative thesis of an upcoming new article in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cvir.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;a journal launched in April of 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;available &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/gzspe/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as a preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;), authored by Joshua Wright and Yuelee Khoo at Simon Fraser University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37106&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The paper is mostly dedicated to a literature review which summarises a wide array of findings about the supposed link between religion and violence. Overall, Wright and Khoo argue that the literature points in both directions, and that there’s little reason, at this relatively early juncture in understanding the connection between religion and behaviour, to believe that there’s something unique to religious ideologies that cause them to foster violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That said, there are certainly plenty of studies on the side of the ledger that suggest religion does cause violence. For example, the authors cite research showing that the more that people felt the September 11th attacks to be a violation of their sacred values, the more likely they were to “endorse … the use of nuclear and biological weapons in response.” Similarly, “The more Christians perceive Jews as desecrators of Christianity, the more prejudice they exhibit toward [them].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the authors also highlight complexities that fog up the picture. For example, they cite one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00264.x&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; by US psychologist Tammy Greer that found (in Wright’s and Khoo’s words) “greater frequency of church attendance and greater frequency of engagement in church activities was associated with less self-reported vengeance,” but at the same time that “a more consistent donation pattern was related to greater self-reported vengeance.” This suggests that, in some circumstances at least, asking slightly different questions about religiosity can yield answers pointing opposite directions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other studies, meanwhile, provide apparently unequivocal evidence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;against&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the “religion causes violence” argument, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000647&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of “600 men in the Arkansas correctional system” for whom religiosity was correlated with “lower self-reported acts of actual violent behavior over one’s lifetime,” which lined up with the results of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386973&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; showing an inverse link between church attendance and crime in Sweden. And “Longitudinal work confirms the relationship between greater involvement in religious activities and less aggressive behavior across the lifespan,” say Wright and Khoo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;So the literature is clearly a hodgepodge. And even if religion can be linked to an increased susceptibility to violence, the authors point out that this is not unique to religion. “While threat perceptions toward individuals’ religious identities may institute aggressive or violent responses, these effects are a product of a general social psychological process of group behavior, rather than anything inherent to religion,” they write. That is, when ardent adherents of secular ideologies sense threat, they, too, often lash out at outsiders – what’s going on is a fairly universal aspect of social psychology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There could have been many situations in which researchers, by only asking questions about religion, missed this bigger picture. For example, while attendance at religious services has been associated with increased hostility toward, and intentions to harm, outgroups, it could be that religious attendance is simply a proxy for people having strong in-group identification. It’s plausible that greater attendance at national, sporting or other secular ceremonies, might similarly correlate with hostility towards relevant outgroups – but if the only questions you ask are about religion, the only answers you get will be about religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In their conclusion, Wright and Khoo make a final point that should give pause to anyone who thinks the research literature, at present, offers a comprehensive look at the link between religion and violence. As they explain, “What makes religion unique … is a belief in the supernatural, the meaning of this belief to the individual and the group, and the internalization and integration of religious identity to the individual.” And yet “Direct study of supernaturalism is noticeably absent in the literature.” If the authors are correct, this means researchers have so far left out the single most important aspect of religious identity – leaving an incomplete picture as to whether it really does have a unique effect on the likelihood of violence or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attachment theory, which was first proposed in the 1950s by the British psychoanalyst John Bowlby, is one of the most influential in psychology. It argues for the importance of our earliest relationships with our caregivers, and predicts that these formative bonds will shape the nature of our connections with other people for the rest of our lives. Remarkably, however, psychologists still know relatively little about how people’s attachment style – essentially their characteristic style of relating to other people – typically varies through life. “How do attachment orientations change across the life span? Unfortunately … this critical question has eluded researchers,” write William Chopik and colleagues in their recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33544-001&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research is the first to document how attachment style varies, on average, through decades of the lifespan, from age 13 to 72. The results suggest that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/09/new-insights-into-lifetime-personality-change-from-meta-study-featuring-50000-participants/&quot;&gt;like other aspects of personality&lt;/a&gt;, attachment style is relatively stable through life, but that it is not entirely fixed, and in particular that it may be shaped by our relationship experiences, as well as the varied social demands of different life stages. “The current study is one of the first truly longitudinal investigations into life span changes in attachment orientation and the antecedents of these changes,” write Chopik and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37096&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from five historic projects, involving personality surveys of 628 US citizens born between 1920 and 1967. The shortest of these was 9 years and the longest was 47 years. They all involved participants being assessed repeatedly over many years using the California Adult Q-sort – a measure that includes 100 personality items. Chopik and his team focused on 14 key items from this measure, allowing them to compile scores for “anxious attachment” and “avoidant attachment” for each participant. People who score highly on “anxious attachment” fear rejection and constantly seek reassurance. People who score highly on “avoidant attachment” find intimacy uncomfortable and find it difficult to provide emotional support to others. Low scores on both anxiety and avoidance is a sign of having a secure attachment style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stitched the data from the five historic samples together, so that they had scores for anxious and avoidant attachment spanning 59 years. Past research has already looked at how people of different ages vary in their attachment scores, but one problem with that kind of cross-sectional research is that any differences between people of different ages could be due to generational differences, rather than due to developmental trends. The new research largely overcome that problem, with Chopik and his team able to identify clear age-related trends in the same individuals over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team found that people’s anxious attachment tended to be high in adolescence, increasing into their young adulthood, before then declining through life into their middle and old age. Avoidant attachment showed less change with age, but started higher in adolescence and then declined in linear fashion through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers surmised that attachment anxiety and avoidance may be high in adolescence due to the stressful transition from having primarily close bonds with parents to having meaningful relationships with peers and first romantic relationships. They also pointed out that mid-life – when anxiety and avoidance tend to decline – is arguably the time when we are most invested in various social roles and relationships and that “…increases in security often result from people becoming more comfortable in their relationships, gaining more evidence that the relationship will last, and having spouses who serve attachment needs and functions that promote close relations.” Meanwhile, in later life, when attachment anxiety and avoidance are typically lowest, they said people tend to be very focused on the here and now – “declines in anxiety and avoidance may reflect the efforts of older adults to become closer to their close friends and family,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding from the study was that at all times of life, being in a close romantic relationship tended to go hand in hand with scoring lower on attachment anxiety and avoidance. “Romantic partners reward appropriate behaviour and admonish inappropriate behaviour … ,” the researchers said. “By investing in these social roles, individuals adhere to the rules and appropriate behaviour of close relationships and may change how they approach relationships accordingly, perhaps becoming more secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that this research looked at group averages, which inevitably masks the idiosyncratic ways that some people may change in their attachment style through life. The study is also limited by only involving participants from the US, the fact that it relied on extracting attachment scores from a measure not designed for that purpose, and that data was stitched together from multiple samples so as to cover the period from adolescence to later life. In a way, however, that last point is also a positive: “given the many ways in which these samples differed, the amount of consistency across the samples in estimating changes over time in attachment is even more remarkable. The converging evidence is a testament to the robustness of these results, such that they were found under different conditions in samples collected between 1936 and 2016,” the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty for future research to build on, including looking at how the consequences of different attachment styles might vary at different stages of life, and whether and how early life experiences might interact with the developmental trends identified in this study.  The researchers concluded that “By examining these future directions and identifying the conditions under which attachment orientations change, we can finally start taking seriously Bowlby’s claim that attachment experiences are important from the cradle to the grave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33544-001&quot;&gt;Longitudinal changes in attachment orientation over a 59-year period&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 How does retraction change publishing behavior? Mark Bolland and Andrew Grey, who were two members of a team whose work led to dozens of retractions for Yoshihiro Sato, now third on the Retraction Watch leaderboard, joined forces with Vyoma Mistry to find out. We asked Bolland to answer several questions about the new University of … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;http://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/08/how-often-do-authors-with-retractions-for-misconduct-continue-to-publish/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;How often do authors with retractions for misconduct continue to publish?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of ways to calm ourselves via our senses, the obvious is to listen to relaxing music, have a massage, or perhaps to gaze upon a rustic scene. However, evidence is growing for a far less obvious option involving the vestibular system (located in the inner ear), which detects the position and movement of the head. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/01/rock-a-bye-adult-study-shows-grown-ups-enjoy-better-sleep-and-memory-consolidation-in-a-rocking-bed/&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, gentle rocking helps adults to fall asleep for a nap, and to sleep more soundly during an entire night, with the researchers who conducted that research hypothesising that the effect is driven by the vestibular system. Now new exploratory work by a different team provides further hints that stimulating the vestibular system can help to calm the brain — in this case, apparently reducing anxiety.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00014/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MRK_973135_55_Neuros_20190425_arts_A&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, led by Florane Pasquier at the University of Caen Normandy, the 22 healthy young adult participants weren’t physically rocked. Rather, electrodes, placed behind their ears, delivered a very mild, 1mA current to stimulate the nerves that carry signals from the individual components of the vestibular system to the brain. This technique is called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37077&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student participants took part in three sessions, each one held at the same time on the same day each week for three weeks. One was a 38-minute sham session during which no current was used; another involved 38 minutes of GVS, while the last involved 76-minutes of the stimulation (participants completed the different sessions in a randomised order). Before and after each session, the participants indicated on a visual scale how relaxed or tense they felt (as a simple measure of their anxiety levels), and also reported any feelings of motion sickness (a conflict between signals from the vestibular system versus the eyes and other sensory receptors in the body is thought to cause motion sickness.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one session was associated with a significant decrease in the anxiety measure the researchers reported: the shorter, 38-minute period of stimulation. This was associated with a drop of about one quarter in the anxiety measure, post- vs pre-test, whereas there was no drop after the sham treatment, and only a hint of a much smaller drop after the double-duration stimulation. Pasquier’s team suspect that the electrical stimulation of neurons from the vestibular system may simulate the effects of gentle rocking, as in a train or car&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;— something that can make many of us, whether adults or children, feel drowsy. “A possible hypothesis is the sedative effect of GVS on arousal state,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are consistent with other studies that have also found vestibular stimulation can affect mood. For example, one that found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800522/&quot;&gt;swinging on a swing improved the anxiety&lt;/a&gt; levels of university students.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t the longer session of GVS work? It’s not clear. Perhaps a clue comes from the fact that after a 76-minute session — but not the shorter 38-minute session— some participants reported feeling motion sickness.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is preliminary research. The anxiety measure was simple, and the study was conducted on a small number of young adults who didn’t report having any anxiety problems. Might a shorter session reduce anxiety scores, too? Is the apparent anxiety effect sustained, and if so, for how long? Could GVS make any real-world difference to people suffering from an anxiety disorder, or who are about to go into an anxiety-provoking situation, and is it 100 per cent safe? Only future research will tell. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the movie scene: a nervous aide has to deliver bad news to his villainous boss, stumbling over his words and incessantly apologising. For a second, it looks like he will be OK – until the boss turns around and summarily executes him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out this phenomenon of “shooting the messenger” is not just restricted to fiction. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-19962-004&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt; has demonstrated that we do tend to take a dim view of the bearers of bad news – even when these people are simply innocent messengers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37074&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work had already shown that we often form unfavourable opinions of people who give us negative feedback. But this could be justified: the reviewer could have been unfairly biased against us, for example. Leslie John and colleagues at Harvard University wanted to take things further and find out how we view others who are simply a conduit for bad news, and who clearly have no control over the content of the message they’re sharing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of 11 experiments, the team looked at how people responded when taking part in, or imagining, a situation where someone delivered them bad or good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study confirmed that bearers of bad news are not well-liked. Participants had the chance to win an extra $2 when a research assistant picked a number from a hat, depending on whether it was odd or even. After picking the number, the research assistant handed it to a colleague – the “messenger” – to read out. Participants who received bad news – that they had not won the extra $2 – later rated this innocent messenger as less likeable than those who received good news.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent studies, the team tried to figure out exactly what was driving people to shoot the messenger. The effect seemed to be specific to those who deliver the news, with others present at the same time remaining unaffected. In one scenario, for example, participants imagined a hospital appointment where they received either good or bad news about whether a skin biopsy was cancerous. There were two nurses in the scenario, one who delivered the news and the other who was there to schedule a follow-up appointment – but only the “messenger” nurse was rated as less likeable when the news was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the effect was stronger in situations in which bad news was unexpected or made less sense. In another scenario, participants imagined that while waiting at the airport, a staff member announced that their flight was delayed by three hours. Half of the participants were told that flights would still be departing in the scheduled order, while the rest were told that another plane had been given their flight’s departure slot. In the latter situation (which, the authors write, “violate[s] the commonly held beliefs that the world is just, predictable, and comprehensible”), the participants gave the staff member a particularly low likeability rating.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a handful of experiments revealed that people may shoot the messenger because they believe the messenger has nefarious motives – even when this doesn’t make logical sense. One group had the chance to win 50 cents if they predicted correctly whether the number of words in the main headline of the next day’s &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; was even or odd. The next day, those who heard from a research assistant that they had guessed wrong didn’t just rate this researcher as less likable – they also said they thought that the researcher had been hoping they’d get it wrong, even though she clearly had no control over the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the research suggests that “shooting the messenger” has a real basis in the way people act in everyday situations. It seems to stem from a number of sources, including a desire to make sense of negative or unexpected situations, and a tendency to misattribute malicious motives to messengers. While the researchers concentrated on the “likability” of the messenger, they add that participants could be making other negative judgements as well: for example, one of the studies found that people also judge bringers of bad news as less competent.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tendencies make life harder for both messenger and receiver, the authors say. Delivering bad news is already a difficult task, and being seen as unlikable only adds to that struggle. And because people aren’t keen on accepting advice from those they dislike, they might miss out on important help. “Especially when the messenger is integral to the solution, as is often the case in medical contexts, ‘shooting the messenger’ may impede people from taking steps to make their own futures brighter,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five tiny new frog species found in Madagascar–meet the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mini &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;frogs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Three of these five new species, all of which range from 7.7-15 mm in length, belong to an entirely new genus: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Mini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These Madagascan frogs’ miniscule scale enriches the picture of convergent evolution towards tininess in frog species (in addition to being extremely cute). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Lead author Mark Scherz says: ‘When frogs evolve small body size, they start to look remarkably similar, so it is easy to underestimate how diverse they really are. Our new genus name, , says it all: adults of the two smallest species &lt;em&gt;Mini mum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mini scule&lt;/em&gt;, are 8–11 mm, and even the largest member of the genus, &lt;em&gt;Mini ature&lt;/em&gt;, at 15 mm, could sit on your thumbnail with room to spare.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Don’t!) Feel the Burn–SPF moisturizer tends to be applied less effectively than traditional sunscreen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even more concerningly, a post-study questionnaire revealed that participants were unaware of their incomplete coverage. As we move into summer here in the Northern Hemisphere, don’t forget your eyes need sun protection (and sunglasses are always an option, too!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Co-author Austin McCormick adds: “Moisturiser is not as well applied as sunscreen; therefore, if planning prolonged sun exposure we advise sunscreen be used. If using moisturiser we advise one with SPF: any SPF is better than none, but it should not be considered the equal of sunscreen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climate Change May Contribute to Hay Fever Increase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/spring-_-pollen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8549 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/spring-_-pollen-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you suffer from hay fever, climate change might be contributing to your allergies. A recent study in PLOS ONE showed that areas in the USA where the onset of spring was earlier than normal–or significantly later than normal–corresponded to an increased prevalence in hay fever sufferers. Lead author Amir Sapkota and colleagues used NASA satellite data along with CDC National Health Interview data to compile this first quantitative dataset pointing to a link between spring timing and allergies. The authors speculate that early spring means a longer season for tree pollen, whereas a late spring may mean a high pollen concentration across many different species–in either case, bad news for allergy sufferers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sapkota adds: “We need to better prepare, and increase community resilience to minimize the disease burden associated with climate change.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power (or powerlessness) of parents to shape their children for good or ill continues to preoccupy psychologists and the public alike. Among evolutionary-minded developmental psychologists, one specific idea is that girls’ later attitudes to relationships is influenced by their fathers’ behaviour. For instance, US research has found that girls with disengaged, harsh, and often absent fathers are known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/sex-specific-pathways-to-early-puberty-sexual-debut-and-sexual-ri&quot;&gt;start having sex at a younger age&lt;/a&gt;, and to have more sexual partners. However many questions about these findings remain. For example: might other aspects of the girls’ childhoods be involved; what about genetic effects; and which aspects of poor-quality fathering are the most consequential? &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/dev0000741&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of pairs of sisters, published in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, provides some specific answers, particularly that it is contact with a poor-quality father, not paternal absence, that affects their daughters’ later relationships, including their expectations of men, and, in turn, their sexual behaviour. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37062&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle DelPriore at Pennsylvania State University and colleagues recruited 233 pairs of biological sisters who were all of reproductive age (18-36), born at least four years apart, and whose parents had divorced or separated before the younger sister turned 14. On average, the older sisters had spent 5.6 years longer living with their fathers than the younger sisters.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sister-pair design allowed the researchers to focus in, as much as possible, on the effects of the father’s behaviour, and his presence or absence from the home. They reasoned that, for each pair, while the younger sister would have spent less time living with their father, most other potential influences on their attitudes to men and their sexual behaviour – including childhood culture, religion, and even genes, to some extent – would be similar.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sisters all completed assessments of the quality of their childhood relationship with their father (rating his warmth or harshness, and his involvement in their daily lives, for example). They also rated levels of any paternal behavioural or mental health problems (noting drug abuse or suicide attempts, for example) while they were growing up. The women also completed assessments of their expectations for men as parents and partners, and reported on how many sexual partners they had had in the past year, and how many different sexual partners they would like to have, and expected to have, in future.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that older sisters who were exposed to poor-quality paternal behaviour (particularly in terms of behavioural or mental health problems) reported lower expectations of the investment they were likely to receive from a male partner. These women also reported having more sexual partners. (Women who don’t expect to get much support from a partner may be more likely to engage in short-term relationships, it has been suggested.) For the younger sisters, who had spent significantly less time living with their fathers, the analysis revealed no effect of paternal behaviour on these measures. The researchers also gathered ratings of maternal warmth, and in contrast to the paternal findings, these did not relate to expectations of male partners, or sexual behaviour.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It appears that the father’s behaviour while in the home rather than his absence from the home has the strongest influence on his daughter’s sexual behaviour,” DelPriore and her colleagues concluded.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly limitations to the study. An important one is that it’s based on self-reports of events and behaviour in the past, and retrospective reports are known to be vulnerable to bias and error. Also, it’s very hard to tease out the individual effects of numerous variables. But this study does go some way towards trying to isolate potential influences of a father’s behaviour on his daughter’s relationships with men, and in so doing “provides a modifiable target for interventions attempting to reduce risky sexual behavior” the researchers said.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, neuroimaging studies have provided new insights into how psychoactive drugs alter the brain’s activity. Psilocybin – the active ingredient in magic mushrooms – has been found to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/182410/magic-mushrooms-reset-brains-depressed-patients/&quot;&gt;reduce activity in brain regions involved in depression&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while MDMA seems to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345398&quot;&gt;augment brain activity for positive memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new study sheds some light into what’s going in the brain when people smoke cannabis – and it turns out that the effects can be quite different depending on the specific strain of the drug. The research, published recently in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119841568?journalCode=jopa&quot;&gt;suggests that cannabis disrupts particular brain networks&lt;/a&gt; – but some strains can buffer against this disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabis contains two major active ingredients: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is responsible for many of the drug’s psychoactive effects, such as the feeling of being stoned and the anxiety that people sometimes feel, as well as feelings of euphoria. High-THC strains of cannabis – known as skunk – are commonly consumed, with modern strains often having little CBD content, say the authors, and this has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;put smokers at higher risk of developing psychosis. CBD, which is present at varying levels in other recreational strains of cannabis, doesn’t produce intoxication but may reduce anxiety and psychotic symptoms, suggesting it could block potentially harmful effects of THC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, few neuroimaging studies have examined how brain activity is influenced by different concentrations of these two ingredients. So Matthew Wall and colleagues decided to look at the neural effects of two strains of cannabis: one high in THC but with no CBD, and the other with high levels of both compounds.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 17 participants who used cannabis fairly regularly but not heavily. All participants completed three sessions; in each session they were given one of the two strains of cannabis, or a placebo that didn’t contain either compound but still smelled like the drug. Half an hour after inhaling the vaporised drug, the participants had an MRI scan to measure their resting brain activity. After the scan they rated the intensity of the drug’s effects, scoring themselves on measures such as&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;such as how anxious they were or how dry their mouth was.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at patterns of connectivity within brain networks while participants were on the different drugs. They were particularly interested in the default mode network (DMN), which is active when we’re just resting and/or thinking about ourselves, and the salience network, which is involved in switching between this kind of internally-focused state and engaging with the outside world.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that when participants smoked either strain of cannabis, the functional connectivity within their DMN was disrupted compared to when they smoked the placebo. But the pattern of disruption was strikingly different depending on the strain. Most prominently, the THC-only strain disrupted connectivity within an area of the DMN called the posterior cingulate cortex, and the amount of disruption in this area was directly related to participants’ ratings of the intensity of the drug’s effects. When participants took the strain that also contained CBD, disruption in this brain area disappeared, suggesting that CBD was blocking this effect. Differences between the two strains were also apparent in the salience network, where the THC-only strain similarly caused much more widespread disruption than the CBD strain.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that CBD may act as a “buffer” against some of the neurological effects of THC, the researchers say, particularly those in the posterior cingulate cortex that are related to feelings of intoxication. This region also contains a high density of the receptors which THC acts upon, and other research has found that long-term use of cannabis can reduce the number of these receptors. This suggests that disruption in the posterior cingulate cortex could be related to the development of harmful long-term effects of the drug like psychosis and dependence – and that strains of cannabis that include CBD may be able to protect against these damaging effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that further evidence is needed for this theory – and it will also be important to study the effects of the strains in other populations. In this study, the researchers examined only semi-regular users who had never experienced any problems with drug-taking. The effects of cannabis in the brain could be very different in this group compared to those who have never taken the drug – or those who have had negative experiences with it.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, understanding that not all strains of cannabis are created equal is important in a time where the drug is becoming more widely accepted, the authors say. “As cannabis transitions to legal/decriminalized status in many jurisdictions, understanding the neural effects of different strains of cannabis (with different levels of THC and CBD) is now a priority for public health,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119841568?journalCode=jopa&quot;&gt;Dissociable effects of cannabis with and without cannabidiol on the human brain’s resting-state functional connectivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cesarean section is a common surgery that, like most surgical procedures, can cause stress and anxiety in patients. Stress and anxiety in women undergoing cesarean section is especially concerning due to negative effects on post-operative recovery, lactation, and newborn development. More non-pharmacological treatments are needed to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has long been considered to have stress-reducing effects, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615601696&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;numerous trials have shown&lt;/a&gt; that playing music during the surgical process reduces pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Although there have been a few studies on music during cesarean section, there is no strong evidence of an effect on validated or objective measures of stress and anxiety of patients. Therefore, Hepp &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a randomized controlled trial to examine if music during cesarean section reduces both validated patient-reported and objective measures of stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11015 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/music-300x150.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and four patients were randomized to hear music from their choice of genre or no music during standard cesarean surgery. Both groups had high self-reported anxiety before the start of the procedure, but the group that heard music reported a significantly greater reduction in anxiety at the end of the procedure. Measurement of a stress hormone at the end of the procedure showed that stress sensation during surgery was significantly lower in the group that heard music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these results show that playing music during surgery is a relatively easy way to reduce stress and anxiety in new mothers giving birth by cesarean surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1871-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Can treatment and care practices influence normal birth outcomes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that the use of medical interventions during labor and birth has slowly increased over the course of the last two decades in over 20 developed countries.  Although medical interventions can be beneficial to mothers and their newborns, they do pose additional risks.  As such, new policies and reforms have been implemented internationally in favor of normal birth, which is defined as an unassisted vaginal birth without labor induction, epidural, anesthesia, or episiotomy.  Despite the increased interest in facilitating normal birth, few studies have assessed the factors that inhibit it. This study aimed to evaluate both the modifiable and non-modifiable factors influencing the outcome of normal birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, Prosser &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, obtained data from the Having a Baby in Queensland Survey. The original survey included all women who gave birth between 2011 and 2012 in Queensland, Australia and evaluated women’s maternity care experiences. From this data, the authors determined that the non-modifiable factors that reduced the likelihood of normal birth included gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, previous cesarean section, the number of previous births, age, and later-term pregnancies. The leading modifiable factors that contributed to increased rates of normal birth included continuity of care through labor, freedom of movement, and a non-supine position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also assessed the model of care and found that midwifery-led care (both public and private), GP shared care and standard public care resulted in the highest rates of normal birth while private obstetrics care resulted in the lowest rates of normal birth within the study sample.  Interestingly, these results also account for both obstetric and social risk factors, leading the authors to argue that these disparities might be a result of the philosophical differences between the two models of perinatal care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors concluded that treatment and care practices can influence normal birth outcomes and normal birth may increase with the appropriate facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1656-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breastfeeding experience among obese women – challenges and how to overcome them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11013&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11013&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Claesson-BF-300x257.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Claesson et al., 2019&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that “breast is best” and that breastfeeding is beneficial to both mothers and infants, with increased duration of breastfeeding providing increased benefits. However, many women face challenges in initiation and/or continuation of breastfeeding for a wide variety of reasons. One group that has been shown to have a lower rate and duration of breastfeeding is mothers with obesity.  These women may face barriers which include complications during delivery delaying the initiation of breastfeeding, physical discomfort, and reduced body confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ing-Marie Claesson and colleagues conducted a qualitative study focusing on 11 obese breastfeeding women in Sweden in order to understand their points of view, which is crucial to developing effective ways to support these women. Although some women had reservations, most intended to breastfeed, viewing it as an integral and natural part of motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants identified three categories of challenges. First, there were difficulties in finding a position that worked both for their own bodily comfort and their infant’s ability to nurse. Some women felt that infants had more difficulty nursing from their larger breasts. Second, the need to expose at least some part of their bodies in order to breastfeed discouraged some of the women, especially from breastfeeding in public. This was linked to low overall self-esteem, which was affected by being obese. Lastly, the unexpected difficulties in breastfeeding led to frustration and disappointment, which in some cases led to giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women also discussed the support they did or did not receive from healthcare providers. Some participants felt that the focus on the infant’s weight gain led to a pressure to switch to formula. Other participants recalled that support from healthcare providers who did not focus on their obesity increased their confidence and strengthened them as breastfeeding mothers. These experiences highlight the need for individualized support that helps women with obesity overcome the practical difficulties of breastfeeding without the focus being on the mother’s weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1745-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eating Disorders and Pregnancy: what are the barriers for identification during the perinatal period?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders (EDs) can affect up to eight percent of pregnant women and are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.  Pregnant women suffering from Anorexia Nervosa face risks such as premature birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight, while pregnant women suffering from Binge Eating disorder face increased risk for delivering a baby with a higher birth weight. Due to these risks, early identification of EDs is necessary for tailoring antenatal care needs.  In this study, the obstacles of disclosing and identifying EDs were evaluated from the perspective of both pregnant women and health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, found that although women reported an overall reduction in eating disorder symptoms during pregnancy, over half of the participants experienced some symptoms, most commonly binge eating and restricting calories.  Despite these symptoms, only 26% disclosed to a health care professional.  The authors then developed five themes based on interviews conducted with women who did not disclose their symptoms:  stigma, lack of opportunity, preference for self-management, current ED symptomatology, and illness awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10200 alignright&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Eating-Disorders-Pregnancy-1-300x169.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After surveying pregnant women, Bye &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;conducted a focus group with healthcare students and professionals, including both midwives and health visitors.  Many of the healthcare providers felt that they lacked adequate knowledge on EDs in pregnancy because it wasn’t included in their training at all or training was limited.  Some also thought that this contributed to the lack of knowledge of the relevant policies and management guidelines for EDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the leading factor inhibiting disclosure amongst pregnant women was stigma.  Similarly, healthcare students and professionals felt they were ill-equipped to help those they had suspected might have an ED.  As a result, the authors argue that improvements in eating disorder education is needed amongst prenatal healthcare providers to give them more confidence in the identification of eating disorders, decrease stigma, and lead to better guidelines for how to address the disorder.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/05/22/better-training-could-help-health-professionals-identify-and-support-pregnant-women-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our blog post by the authors of this study&lt;/a&gt; where they discuss specific activities that could raise both professional and public awareness about eating disorders in order to improve pregnancy outcomes and patient experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your personality traits play an important part in how long you are likely to live, as much as, or even more than, other personal factors like your intelligence and your family’s economic background. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618302502&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt; has identified a key factor that mediates the personality-mortality link – sleep. Simply put, people with certain personality characteristics are more likely to sleep too little, or too much, or to experience greater sleepiness during the day, and in turn this raises their year-on-year risk of dying (too little or excess sleep, and poor quality sleep, have known links with various health risks, such as cardiovascular disease, depression and chronic inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sleep has been associated with both personality and longevity, yet [before now] no study has investigated whether sleep is a pathway linking personality to objective health outcomes,” say the researchers, led by Shantel Spears at West Virginia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-37011&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data collected from thousands of participants as part of the long-running National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, including information on their personality traits recorded in 1995-1996, and information on their sleep duration and sleep quality collected in 2004-2006. Nearly 4000 participants provided data at both these time points, and the researchers then used national records to see which of them had died and when, up to October, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, based on the known importance of sleep to health, the research showed that too little or too much sleep was associated with increased risk of dying – approximately 65 minutes more than, or under, the average nightly sleep duration (7 hours in this sample) was associated with a 10 per cent increased risk of dying over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to personality, and consistent with many prior studies, participants who scored lower on trait conscientiousness were more likely to die before the end of the research period, and Spears’ team established that this was explained in part by these people getting less sleep, on average, and feeling less rested during the day (a mark of poorer sleep quality). Although the study didn’t look into why exactly people low in conscientiousness were getting less sleep, one can imagine they engage in more &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/01/psychologists-investigate-a-major-ignored-reason-for-our-lack-of-sleep-bedtime-procrastination/&quot;&gt;bedtime procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, and generally struggle to establish &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/21/episode-11-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep/&quot;&gt;a healthy bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, high scorers on trait neuroticism were indirectly at greater risk of dying because of their lower and higher than average amounts of sleep, and their on-average greater feelings of fatigue in the daytime. Again, one can speculate that these folk, who have lower moods and more worry, might struggle to get to sleep or to get up promptly in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower scores on extraversion were indirectly linked with increased risk of death, thanks to an association with greater daytime feelings of fatigue (perhaps extraverts’ greater daytime activity levels makes it easier for them to get a satisfying night’s sleep, but this is speculation). Most surprising – given prior research findings have not identified this trait as being relevant to sleep – was the indirect link between higher trait agreeableness and risk of dying, explained by these people having less sleep and more daytime fatigue; it’s not clear why this might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research had already established that personality predicts longevity because of its association with various health behaviours, such as more conscientious people being less likely to smoke, or drink and eat to excess. However, much of the personality-linked variance in risk of dying has remained unexplained, and this study now identifies too little or too much sleep (and feeling insufficiently rested during the day) as other important factors. “Our findings suggest that short and long sleep duration and daytime dysfunction may be important pathways linking aspects of personality to reduced life expectancy,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has some important limitations including the participants being mostly white and highly educated; the reliance on a short self-report test of personality; and the subjective measure of sleep being based on time spent in bed rather being asleep per se. Nonetheless, if the results can be replicated, they raise some important implications for public health, suggesting that personality screening could be used to identify those people – especially high scorers in neuroticism and low scorers in conscientiousness – most likely to benefit from interventions aimed at improving sleep. “Alternatively,” the researchers said, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/19/a-little-discussed-effect-of-therapy-it-changes-your-personality/&quot;&gt;changing these aspects of personality&lt;/a&gt; could improve sleep for these individuals, enhancing their health and longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/PTTP-header-image_blog-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Can you believe it’s been one whole year since we launched our preprint-posting partnership with bioRxiv? This calls for a celebration! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Just last May, we began offering authors the choice of having PLOS post their manuscript to the preprint server, bioRxiv, when they submitted to a PLOS journal*. Our opt-in service has made it easier for authors to post their work early and has encouraged many authors to try preprinting their research for the first time. As of today, we’ve posted more than 2,500 preprints! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many of our authors have now seen their work go from preprint to published and it’s amazing to see the transformation their work has taken – just take a look at the examples below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 690; border-color: pink; border-style: solid; border-weight: 5px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;Published&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we preprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re an author, an editor, or just an avid science reader, preprints offer a lot of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;advantages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for how we share and consume information: they allow research to be shared openly and broadly, spark feedback and collaborations that may not have happened otherwise, enable authors to claim results and demonstrate their work for timely opportunities such as grant proposals and promotions. But if you really want to know how preprints advance science, just ask our authors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/SHawinkle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8503 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/04/SHawinkle.png&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“As statisticians, we provide analysis and data visualization methods for scientists in the field. Sharing code through GitHub and preprints through bioRxiv provides researchers with the latest methodologies as early as possible. The other benefit is that the scientific community can provide researchers with useful feedback prior to publication. This means that we can tailor new methods to scientists’ needs. These interactions were very enriching, and I recommend Open Science to everybody.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stijn Hawinkel, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We actually improved the final version of our paper not only based on the great reviews we received from the formal peer review process, but also based on the feedback we learned through Twitter, and other channels.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At submission, I believed we had a complete story that would interest researchers working on various aspects of adhesion biology. I knew that the story would likely develop further after peer review, but I wanted to share the core results with the community.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Champagne! But our work on preprints isn’t over yet. We’re experimenting with new ways to raise awareness and interaction with preprint manuscripts through events like live preprint &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/02/from-preprint-to-publication/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;journal clubs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, hosted by PREreview, and expanding our preprint offerings to include programs like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006448&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprint Editors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re also going through ALL of our data on preprints that we’ve collected over the past year to share back to you. Please join us in celebrating this month and stay tuned for more insights into our preprint program soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Facilitated posting to bioRxiv has been available on &lt;/em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS NTDs, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; PLOS Pathogens &lt;em&gt;since May 2018&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and on &lt;/em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;em&gt; since July 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
