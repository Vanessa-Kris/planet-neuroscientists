&lt;p&gt;Imagining ourselves as no longer existing is, for most of us, terrifying. Buddhism may offer some reassurance. A central tenet of the religion is that all is impermanent and the self is actually an illusion. If there is no self, then why fear the end of the self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out if the logic of the Buddhist perspective eliminates existential fear, Shaun Nichols at the University of Arizona and his colleagues surveyed hundreds of monastic Tibetan Buddhists (monks-in-training) in exile in India, as well as lay Tibetans, Tibetan Buddhists from Bhutan, Indian Hindus and American Christians and atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their astonishment, the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12590/abstract&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Science&lt;/em&gt; that fear of the annihilation of the self was most intense among the monastic Buddhists, and that the monastic Buddhists were less willing than any of the other groups to sacrifice years of their own life for a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33162&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US participants were recruited online, whereas the monastic Tibetan Buddhists and other groups were given paper surveys to complete, translated by fluent bilinguals into the appropriate language. The hundreds of monastic Tibetan Buddhists who took part were from monasteries in Byalkuppe and Mundhod in India. The researchers also surveyed 30 Buddhist scholars about how devoted Buddhists ought to answer the different survey questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the surveys addressed the permanence of the self. As expected, the monastic Buddhists showed the least belief in the continuity of the self – they thought they would be different in personality, beliefs, ambitions and other characteristics in the future. In contrast, the Americans, whether religious or not, showed the strongest belief in the continuity of the self (the other groups, including everyday, non-devout Tibetans, scored mid-way between these two extremes). Similar patterns emerged for beliefs about the existence of a “core self” that persists over time, with the monastic Buddhists again showing the least belief in the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the monastic Buddhists’ scepticism about the self have a bearing on their fear of death? More than the other groups, they said that they used the no-self doctrine to cope with the prospect of death, as the Buddhists scholars said they ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, when the researchers surveyed their participants about their fear of death and especially their fear of self-annihilation (gauged by agreement or not with items like “Dying one year from now frightens me because of the loss and destruction of the self / destruction of my personality”), to the researchers’ surprise they found that this fear was most intense among the monastic Buddhists. This was opposite to how they ought to have responded according to the Buddhist scholars. Note, the Buddhists believed just as strongly in an after-life (though not, of course, for their current “self”), so this could not explain their more intense fear compared with the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers surveyed more participants from the same groups about how much they would be willing to sacrifice years of their own life to extend the life of another person (for instance, in the most extreme version of the thought experiment, they were asked to imagine they could take a pill to extend their own life by six months or give the pill to a stranger, similar to them, for whom the pill would add an additional five years to their life). The monastic Buddhists were the least willing to make this kind of sacrifice – in fact, over 72 per cent preferred to keep the pill for themselves in the above scenario, compared with 31.2 per cent of non-religious Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on Twitter, co-author Nina Strohminger at the University of Pennsylvania said that these findings were “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NinaStrohminger/status/955443909508952065&quot;&gt;probably the most bizarre and unexpected of her career&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the paradox they have uncovered, between the Buddhists’ explicit beliefs and their fears, may be explicable by the fact that, despite their training and explicit claims, the monastic Buddhists still have a powerful sense of a continuous identity that stretches from the past and into the future. It is not easy to defy the illusion of the self even if you are taught to do so. This would seem to be borne out by notable Buddhist autobiographies that betray a keen experience of a continuous self. At the same time, Buddhists may succeed well in truly believing that the self ends at death (unlike other religious groups that preach that the soul is eternal), and this could account for the Buddhists’ exaggerated fear of self-annihilation at death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat to the findings highlighted by the researchers is that, although their monastic Buddhist participants meditated every day,  none of them were highly experienced, long-term meditators with many years of practice. Meditation is seen as one way to eliminate belief in a permanent self, so it will be interesting to repeat the research, not only with other Buddhist denominations, but specifically with highly experienced, expert Buddhist meditators, to see if they too would fear self-annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12590/abstract&quot;&gt;Death and the Self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9739&quot; style=&quot;width: 267px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9739&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fossilpic-300x286.gif&quot; width=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1861 and Hermann von Meyer, a German paleontologist, inspects a slab of Bavarian limestone depicting a single feather. He will name this specimen archaeopteryx, signifying an “ancient wing” or “feather”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, the first Archaeopteryx skeleton was discovered, depicting what was to be considered the oldest known ancestor of the modern bird for decades to come. Marking the boundary between bird and dinosaur, this iconic fossil has been pivotal to our understanding of avian evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the authors re-examined one of the least complete specimens of Archaeopteryx, currently located in the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.  After conducting anatomical analysis, they concluded the “Haarlem specimen” was more likely to have descended from the Chinese Anchiornis, a group of winged dinosaurs that predate the Archaeopteryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study has had fascinating implications for our understanding of the origins of modern birds. The authors propose a westward spread of the avian ancestors from their origins in East Asia and arriving in Bavaria, where their remains would be found 350 million years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1080-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new species of Xenoturbella from the western Pacific Ocean and the evolution of Xenoturbella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9862&quot; style=&quot;width: 144px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9862 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1080_Fig2_HTML-134x300.gif&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the extinct to the extant, we move on to the discovery of a new species of Xenoturbella; a truly bizarre marine organism. Until recently, this mysterious creature had only been collected in the seas off the coast of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not be difficult to mistake Xenoturbella for an old sock, lying abandoned on the sea bed.  Its morphology is very simple and its behavioral habits unknown.  Even its phylogenetic position has been keenly debated throughout recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Xenoturbella’s most defining characteristics are the absence of an anus and the lack of a centralized nervous system. Its mouth serves as the single opening through which food and waste can be exchanged. These remarkable traits make it an attractive choice for investigating the evolutionary origins of these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt; this year reports the identification of a new species of Xenoturbella in the Western Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan. It is relatively easily collected via marine biology dredge and thus holds a lot of promise as a research organism for the further characterization of this strange species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1025-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic variation between urban and rural populations of Darwin’s finches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9863&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9863 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1025_Fig1_HTML-300x260.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling across to the far side of the Pacific Ocean, the authors of our next paper go to the Galapagos Islands to study Darwin’s finches. These birds are best known for helping shape Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. There are 16 species native to the Galapagos islands, each most clearly identified by their differing beak sizes and shapes that are adapted to the different food sources found on each island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 160 years later, the field of epigenetics may provide an explanation for the rapid adaptation that these finches display. Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression rather than the genetic code, achieved through modifications of DNA by processes such as methylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation describes the addition of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms to a cytosine nucleotide, when followed by a guanine, in the order “CpG”. Some methylation patterns have been shown to be heritable, while methylation patterns have even displayed a mutation rate higher than that observed in the genetic code. Crucially, for this study, the environment has also been reported to influence DNA methylation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points to the possibility that epigenetics may contribute to quick phenotypic changes within each species of Darwin’s Finches. However, the process through which this could happen is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying two species of finch, the authors reported significant differences in methylation patterns between urban and rural populations of each species. Urbanization in the Galapagos Islands has happened within the last 60 years, so while the authors are careful to acknowledge the possibility of random epigenetic drift, if urbanization is the cause for these differences in methylation then these changes have occurred impressively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0936-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A genetic chronology for the Indian Subcontinent points to heavily sex-biased dispersals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9864&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/India_BMNG-289x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;Our next study examines mitochondrial DNA to determine the ancient ancestry of the modern day Indian population. Between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans were thought to have moved out of east Africa and through the Indian subcontinent, consequently making the Indian population one of the most genetically diverse on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the genetic study of the Indian population is no easy task. High levels of endogamy are common due to rigid social boundaries imposed by the caste system. The upshot of this is variation in the genetic code, known as genetic drift, between these socially isolated populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most interestingly, a movement of people from central Asia around 4000 years ago provides new evidence for the spread of the ancient Indo–European language into India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study aimed to remedy these problems by tracing the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, which is exclusively maternally inherited as well as DNA found exclusively on the Y chromosome, which is exclusively passed down the male line. This allows lineages to be traced for millennia back in time. In combination with genome wide analyses, ancient immigration patterns were able to be deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory proposing an “Indo-Aryan invasion” to India is highly controversial. It has the potential to explain the presence of Indo-European languages, spoken across the northern half of India, while some have also attributed the origins of the caste system to this hypothetical event. Previously, there had been no archaeological data or genetic data to support any claims this event may have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is proposed in this paper is a succession of migration waves from Iran, the Caucasus and Anatolia over the period of 50,000 years. Perhaps most interestingly, a movement of people from central Asia around 4000 years ago provides new evidence for the spread of the ancient Indo–European language into India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics have pointed to the lack of ancient preserved DNA in South Asia to confirm any migration occurred. This study does, however, provide an exciting new perspective on this often disputed topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1014-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going deeper in the automated identification of Herbarium specimens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9865&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9865 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1014_Fig4_HTML-300x197.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final study in our end of year selection focuses on the use of artificial intelligence to identify new species of plant. Vast numbers of preserved plant specimens have been increasingly archived in a digital format and placed online in publicly available databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As contemporary understanding of plant phylogenetics and evolution develops, our knowledge of plant species becomes outdated and data entries must be revised.  Around 350 million specimens are stored in herbaria around the world. This huge amount of data means that this is no fitting task for mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Carranza-Rojas et al designed an algorithm designed to use deep learning to identify plant species based on digital images of preserved plant specimens. The software was able to produce the correct plant species within the top 5 results 90% of the time, while the correct result was the first hit for 70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning technology shows considerable promise in the field of botany, with the potential to revolutionize plant identification. We look forward to further studies and new break-throughs, ushering in the next generation of software in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/5762479865_24980dabb0_b-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0122-6&quot;&gt;Understanding and Combating HIV/AIDS in Cambodian Transgender Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, transgender people are disproportionately vulnerable to HIV. Furthermore, a lack of specific demographic, epidemiological and behavioral information on transgender populations around the world stops the development of HIV-prevention programs that directly target such groups. Seeking to tackle this problem, Siyan Yi and colleagues worked to gain insights into the characteristics, experiences and HIV status of 1,375 transgender women in Cambodia. As well as providing insights into the diverse lives of these women, the study highlighted a number of key factors which may contribute to a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. High-risk sexual behaviors, along with low levels of HIV testing and high prevalence of sex in exchange for money, were identified as potential driving forces behind transmission. Experiences of discrimination while accessing healthcare through traditional routes and a lack of HIV education may additionally act as barriers to reducing such behavior. Any HIV intervention that seeks to target transgender people in Cambodia must address these factors, and the authors highlight the importance of community-based healthcare in providing inclusive, accessible care, as well as proposing HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as potentially effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0128-0&quot;&gt;Realizing Universal Health Coverage in East Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Health is a right for all…it is at the center of our vision of a more sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9858&quot; style=&quot;width: 352px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9858&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/35367997916_82ce73d586_k-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;342&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Kate Holt/Maternal and Child Survival Program&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words, delivered by UN Secretary General António Guterres at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unmultimedia.org/avlibrary/asset/2060/2060252/&quot;&gt;Universal Healthcare Coverage Forum in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, are reflected in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and are representative of widespread attitudes among the international community. However, this rhetoric, argue Alicia Ely Yamin and Allan Maleche, has yet to translate into action at a national level in East Africa.  In an insightful debate article, they highlight ways a human rights-based approach could be used to advance efforts to establish universal healthcare coverage. For example, treating health coverage as a universal human right means access should never be hampered by an individual’s ability to pay. The authors recommend integrating healthcare rights into wider aspects of policy and law, and ensuring meaningful participation of all citizens in setting healthcare priorities. Finally, they call for greater accountability for governments, institutions and programmes whose duty it is to see that healthcare is effective, democratic and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0115-5&quot;&gt;Women’s Attitudes Towards Intimate Partner Violence in Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9856&quot; style=&quot;width: 402px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9856&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/14707792095_f00e1e029e_k-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;392&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Jessica Lea/Department for International Development&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While intimate partner violence is one of the most widespread forms of gender-based violence globally, attitudes towards such acts can vary enormously, and the legality of “wife-beating” remains a controversial issue in many countries. Wife-beating is a socio-culturally accepted norm in many parts of Ethiopia. Eshetu Gurmy and Senait Endale at Addis Ababa University sought to assess the attitudes of Ethiopian women towards wife-beating, which they suggest has untold effects on the physical and mental health of victims and widespread downstream implications for the socio-economic status and individual freedoms of women across Ethiopian society. Using data from the countrywide Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey, the researchers identified a number of factors that might affect the extent to which women accepted wife-beating as a justified norm. Most markedly, attitudes towards intimate partner violence varied geographically, with women in rural areas being generally more accepting than those in urban areas. Factors such as household income, level of education, age, religion and access to the media may contribute to this disparity. Understanding attitudes towards intimate partner violence is vital in developing interventions that seek to change culturally ingrained behaviors and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0119-1&quot;&gt;Perceptions and experiences of female sex workers in accessing HIV services in Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You can read the health worker’s face which shows that he is looking at something very bad and it makes you feel very bad. When they see us, they see us as animals.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female sex workers (FSWs) are disproportionately susceptible to HIV contraction, yet often face a unique set of barriers when attempting to access proper care. Rhoda K. Wanyenze and colleagues conducted focus group discussions with 190 sex workers from across Uganda to identify the challenges they face when accessing HIV services. FSWs from all districts involved in the study reported discriminatory and demeaning treatment by healthcare workers, as in the above quote from a sex worker in Kamapala, as well as fears of legal reprisals when seeking care. Some interviewees expressed worries that their HIV positive status would not remain confidential and feared prejudice and reprisals from other sex workers, as well as from wider society. Interviewees highlighted a number of practical barriers to accessing treatment and contraception, such as unfavorable operation times at healthcare facilities, limited availability of condoms at such facilities, and most notably the cost of obtaining a service. HIV prevalence among FSWs in Uganda is estimated at 34%, and qualitative, interview-based studies such as this highlight the personal attitudes and experiences of individuals, informing a specific and more nuanced approach to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0114-6&quot;&gt;Informing Children of their HIV Status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9854&quot; style=&quot;width: 367px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9854&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/7948879428_0103cc8ddf_b-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: UNICEF&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you tell a child that they have HIV? This is a problem faced by millions of parents and caregivers across the globe, and one with important and widespread health-related repercussions. Only through full disclosure can access and adherence to treatment be ensured. While the WHO recommends incremental disclosure of a child’s HIV status while they are of school age, rates of disclosure prevalence vary enormously internationally. Eric Gyamfi and colleagues utilized a mixed methods approach to assess the attitudes of caregivers of children with HIV and the prevalence of disclosure in the Lower Manya-Krobo District of Ghana. They found that only 7.7% of disclosures happened before the age of 11, with many caregivers reporting they felt children would not understand their disease before that age, or would be unable to keep their diagnosis private. As a health service provider reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Telling children can be problematic because children talk a lot. They may actually disclose the diagnosis to others. This will reveal the status of the mother and the rest of the family, which can result in stigmatization towards them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant social stigma still attached to HIV/AIDS represents a powerful barrier to timely, informed disclosure, with some parents even reporting fears of rejection or blame by their child. The authors recommend development of disclosure guidelines by the Ghana Health Service, as well as improved support for both children and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yield of wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; L.), an important crop, is adversely affected by heat stress in many regions of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotolerance are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proved that &lt;em&gt;TaFER-5B&lt;/em&gt; plays an important role in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ROS scavenging.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors used a systems biology approach to elucidate the complex interacting mechanisms regulating the plasticity of sensorial traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0960-8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis of bud dormancy in grape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9843&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Abhar-iran-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Bud dormancy is an important biological phenomenon of perennial plants that enables them to survive under harsh environmental circumstances. Grape (&lt;em&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/em&gt;) is one of the most grown fruit crop worldwide; however, underlying mechanisms involved in grape bud dormancy are not yet clear. This work was aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism regulating bud dormancy in grape, which may pave the way for ultimate improvements in the grape industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0966-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genome-wide association analysis of seedling traits in diverse Sorghum germplasm under thermal stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9844&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/800px-Sorghum_bicolor03-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Climate variability due to fluctuation in temperature is a worldwide concern that imperils crop production. The need to understand how the germplasm variation in major crops can be utilized to aid in discovering and developing breeding lines that can withstand and adapt to temperature fluctuations is more necessary than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors analyzed the genetic variation associated with responses to thermal stresses in a sorghum association panel (SAP), representing major races and working groups, to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with resilience to temperature stress in a major cereal crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0990-x&quot;&gt;De novo sequencing and comparative transcriptome analysis of the male and hermaphroditic flowers provide insights into the regulation of flower formation in andromonoecious &lt;em&gt;Taihangia rupestris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9845&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/12870_2017_990_Fig1_HTML-300x160.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Taihangia rupestris&lt;/em&gt; is an andromonoecious plant species meaning it bears both male and hermaphroditic flowers within the same individual. However, the establishment and development of male and hermaphroditic flowers in andromonoecious &lt;em&gt;Taihangia&lt;/em&gt; remain poorly understood, due to the limited genetic and sequence information. To investigate the potential molecular mechanism in the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Taihangia&lt;/em&gt; flower formation, the authors used &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptome profiles of male and hermaphroditic flowers at early and late developmental stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0986-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivable gut bacteria provide a pathway for adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica&lt;/em&gt; volatiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9846&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Chrysolina_herbacea-pjt2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemical cross-talk between plants and insects is required in order to achieve a successful co-adaptation. In response to herbivory, plants produce specific compounds, and feeding insects respond adequately to molecules produced by plants. Here the authors show the role of the gut microbial community of the mint beetle &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt; in the chemical cross-talk with &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica&lt;/em&gt; (or watermint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1033-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of drought on wheat leaf cuticle properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9847&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Green_wheat-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;The plant cuticle is the outermost layer covering aerial tissues and is composed of cutin and waxes. The cuticle plays an important role in protection from environmental stresses and glaucousness, the bluish-white colouration of plant surfaces associated with cuticular waxes, has been suggested as a contributing factor in crop drought tolerance. However, the cuticle structure and composition is complex and it is not clear which aspects are important in determining a role in drought tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the authors analyzed residual transpiration rates, cuticle structure and epicuticular wax composition under well-watered conditions and drought in five Australian bread wheat genotypes with contrasting glaucousness and drought tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0971-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chloroplast proteome response to drought stress and recovery in tomato (&lt;em&gt;Solanum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lycopersicum L.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9851&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/tomatoes_red_vegetables_healthy_trusses_ripe_bush_tomatoes_tomato_plant-536819-225x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Drought is a major constraint for plant growth and crop productivity that is receiving an increased attention due to global climate changes. Chloroplasts act as environmental sensors; however, only partial information is available on stress-induced mechanisms within plastids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the authors investigated the chloroplast response to a severe drought treatment and a subsequent recovery cycle in tomato through physiological, metabolite and proteomic analyses, giving an original overview on the role of chloroplast as environmental sensor by both coordinating the expression of nuclear-encoded plastid-localized proteins and mediating plant stress response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1020-8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An integrated RNAseq-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR metabolomics approach to understand soybean primary metabolism regulation in response to &lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia foliar&lt;/em&gt; blight disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9850 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/11056-soybean-plants-growing-pv-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/em&gt; AG1-IA is a devastating phytopathogen causing Rhizoctonia foliar blight (RFB) of soybean worldwide with yield losses reaching 60%. Plant defense mechanisms are complex and information from different metabolic pathways is required to thoroughly understand plant defense regulation and function. Combining information from different “omics” levels such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is required to gain insights into plant metabolism and its regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors studied fluctuations in soybean metabolism in response to &lt;em&gt;R. solani&lt;/em&gt; infection at early and late disease stages using an integrated transcriptomics-metabolomics approach, focusing on the regulation of soybean primary metabolism and oxidative stress tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1187-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De novo transcriptome assembly from flower buds of dioecious, gynomonoecious and chemically masculinized female &lt;em&gt;Coccinia grandis&lt;/em&gt; reveals genes associated with sex expression and modification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9848 alignright&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/12870_2017_1187_Fig1_HTML-300x248.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Coccinia grandis&lt;/em&gt; (ivy gourd), is a dioecious member of Cucurbitaceae having heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Chromosome constitution of male and female plants of &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; is 22A + XY and 22A + XX respectively. Earlier it has been reported that a unique gynomonoecious form of &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; (22A + XX) also exists in nature bearing morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (GyM-H). Additionally, application of silver nitrate (AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on female plants induces stamen development leading to the formation of morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (Ag-H) despite the absence of Y-chromosome. Due to the unavailability of genome sequence and the slow pace at which sex-linked genes are identified, sex expression and modification in &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study would enable identification of new sex-biased genes for further investigation of stamen arrest, pollen fertility, and AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated sex modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids who are better at resisting unhelpful impulses and distractions go on later in life to perform better academically, professionally and socially. But how this kind of self-control develops with age has not been so clear. Teenagers’ show more self-control than children in many ways, but in other respects – think of their propensity for risk-taking – they actually seem to show less self-control than they did when they were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12491/full/&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/i&gt;, Ania Aïte at Paris Descartes University, France, led research investigating whether this might be because there are two types of impulse control – “cool” control, in which emotions are not involved, and “hot” control, in which they are – and that they might show different developmental trajectories. If so, this could have implications for educational interventions aimed at reducing teens’ sometimes dangerous behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33144&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team studied 56 children (aged about 10), 48 adolescents (aged around 13), and 56 young adults (aged about 21). They all completed two different tests of their inhibitory control. In the emotionally neutral test, a classic version of the famous Stroop task, the participants had to indicate, as quickly but accurately as possible, the ink colour of a colour-denoting word (the word “red” written in blue, for example). It requires inhibitory control to ignore word meaning when there’s a mismatch between the word and its ink colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a test of “hot” inhibitory control, the participants saw a series of faces displaying either happiness, anger, fear and sadness, each with either a congruent or incongruent emotional word written below. The participants had to indicate the emotion shown on each face, ignoring the word below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the emotionally neutral task, the adults did better than the adolescents, who did better than the younger children – there was linear improvement with age, just as you might expect. But the results for the emotion test were very different. Adults did better than the younger children, but the adolescents performed the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that the adolescents were worse at &lt;i&gt;identifying &lt;/i&gt;emotions – because when the facial expressions and emotion words matched, there was no difference between their performance and that of the adults. Rather, when there was a face-word mismatch, they found it harder to ignore the emotion word, and to focus only on the facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings appear consistent with the popular idea that adolescence represents a time of heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli, combined with immature connections between the pre-frontal cortex and emotional brain regions, making it more difficult for them to over-rule inappropriate impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If adolescence is associated specifically with poor emotional control, but mature “cool” inhibitory control, this might explain why teens can typically cope fine with exams and other situations that demand “cool control”, yet find it harder than adults to ignore emotional influences, such as friends cheering them on to drink more alcohol, for example. This could explain their characteristically poor decision-making – such as driving while drunk and getting into fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With poor decision-making being responsible for a rise in mortality during adolescence,” the researchers write, “the present findings could usefully contribute to the development of adolescent’ educational programs centered on hot inhibitory control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12491/full&quot;&gt;Adolescents’ inhibitory control: keep it cool or lose control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/table-2723873_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3546-4&quot;&gt;Active smoking and the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9807 alignright&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/smoking.jpg&quot; width=&quot;176&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco smoking is well known to cause lung cancer; however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3546-4&quot;&gt;Andersen et al.&lt;/a&gt;  explored the association between tobacco smoking and breast cancer in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline information and active tobacco smoking data of 28,731 female nurses from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/5/1241/706209&quot;&gt;Danish Nurse Cohort&lt;/a&gt; and their cancer diagnoses from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775350&quot;&gt;Danish Cancer Register&lt;/a&gt; were examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive association between active tobacco smoking and breast cancer incidence was found for women older than 44 years. In particular, women who smoked heavily and for a long time were at the most risk. There was almost a 30% increase in risk of breast cancer in smokers compared to never smokers. This study adds to the growing evidence that active smoking increases the risk of breast cancer, with increased smoking duration and smoking intensity adding to the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1&quot;&gt;Incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions in autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1&quot;&gt;Thomas and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; searched for autopsy studies using terms such as “breast neoplasms”, “autopsy” and “breast diseases”. The study aimed to provide an updated estimate of the prevalence pool of incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions. Although the incidence of breast cancer is thought to be increasing, women may decide not to undergo mammography screening as there is the chance of overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of cancers which would never declare themselves during the patient’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence pool of incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions was concluded to be large across women of all ages. A large pool of undetected cancer in-situ and atypical hyperplasia (which do not advance or do so very slowly) found in the study leads the authors to suggest caution for screening programs. Therefore, there is a need for breast cancer detection methods to be improved to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3347-9&quot;&gt;Anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors often suffer from higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3347-9&quot;&gt;Inhestern et al.&lt;/a&gt; specifically looked at anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors using self-reported questionnaires in cooperation with the regional cancer registries of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Cancer survivors between the age of 25 and 55 at the time of diagnosis were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9808 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/depression-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that around 40% of working-age cancer survivors can experience increased levels of anxiety and around 20% increased levels of depression. Higher anxiety was significantly associated with factors such as female gender, being younger in age, and poorer family functioning. Similarly, a number of factors heightened the chance of depression, for example, unemployment, no treatment being received and less social support being received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors at working-age may require psychological screening for a number of years after diagnosis so that cancer survivors at risk are identified. There may be a need for changes to survivorship programs for those at working-age to deal with the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3580-2&quot;&gt;Self-reported sexual health in breast cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9809 alignright&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/survivors.jpg&quot; width=&quot;230&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see a decrease in breast cancer mortality, there is a need for greater survivorship health care to improve quality of life. In particular, support for survivors with sexual health problems is needed. For example, breast cancer survivors face problems with body image, menopausal symptoms and satisfaction with partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3580-2&quot;&gt;Oberguggenberger and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; investigated sexual health in breast cancer survivors compared to women with no previous or current breast cancer using a patient-reported outcome assessment. This included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00435972&quot;&gt;Sexual Activity Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x/abstract;jsessionid=9D6831D2C9B77F09201C62F14FD86889.f01t03&quot;&gt;Hospital anxiety and depression scale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512208002314?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded overall breast cancer survivors reported worse sexual health than the female general population. An interesting finding was that there wasn’t an association between sexual health in breast cancer survivors and any treatment-related variables, this differs from previous studies and further research is needed. There is a need for health care providers to break the taboo and address sexual health as part of routine survivorship care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; launches new section!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; deeply recognises the prominence of the aforementioned topics, which are central for the field of cancer research. &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; would like to further highlight and promote such topics and is thus launching a new section on “supportive therapy, survivorship and psychosocial oncology” under the trusted leadership of our new Consulting Editor Prof Daniele Santini, University Campus Bio-Medico, Italy.  We would encourage submissions in the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, including management of pain, fatigue, insomnia, nausea and other GI issues, appetite, anxiety, depression and stress management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orphan symptoms in cancer patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal nutrition and physical activity during and after treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy lifestyle choices including smoking cessation, weight management and coping styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based counselling regarding botanicals, supplements and complementary therapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of control and well-being despite the diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging toxicities induced by new generation antineoplastic drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging toxicities induced by new generation immunotherapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, men and women differ psychologically in small but reliable ways, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;interests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/03/30/women-really-are-better-than-men-at-processing-faces/&quot;&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, but the basis of these differences is up for debate. Are they innate or due to how we’re socialised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists look for traction on this question by studying sex differences in the brain, premised on the idea that these might contribute to the observed psychological differences. However, studying the brains of adults, or even teenagers, still leads to spinning wheels, because culturally produced differences will show up in the brain too. But how about one-month old infants, the subjects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00429-017-1600-2&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Brain Structure and Function&lt;/i&gt;?  Since birth, babies at this age have spent most of their time sleeping and suckling with limited eyesight, so profound socialisation effects aren’t going to be a factor. And yet, the new findings reveal that sex differences in a number of brain areas are already apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33129&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Wisconsin-Madison team led by Douglas Dean III recruited 149 expectant mothers who brought in their infants – 77 girls and 72 boys – for brain scanning one month after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember doing MRI scans, and it was awfully noisy. So kudos to the infant neuroimaging community for developing a top-rate comfy environment for the little ones. They were popped into a vacuum immobilisation bag, surrounded with foam for comfort and sound insulation, and issued with ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones. These conditions allowed the scans to be performed while the infants slept, which was vital because even minor movements could have distorted the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean’s team found that the boys’ brains were 8.3 per cent bigger, in line with the sex difference in brain volume found in adults and the few other available infant studies. Also as seen in adults, male brains had relatively more white matter (connecting tissue) and female brains more grey matter, relative to total brain size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of specific neural areas were larger in males, also relative to total brain volume, such as parts of the limbic system involved in emotions, including the amygdala, insula, thalamus and putamen. The researchers also found evidence for relatively larger hippocampi, an area involved in memory, which has more commonly been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818549/&quot;&gt;found to be larger in females&lt;/a&gt;, although not universally so. Meanwhile female brains were relatively larger in other limbic areas such as parts of the cingulate gyrus, caudate and parahippocampal gyrus, and they had a few white-matter structures that were relatively larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sex differences were smaller than has been observed in adults, which suggests that maturation continues this differentiation, likely through the high volume of sex steroid receptors in these brain areas. The alternative suggestion is that the subsequent differentiation is due to socialisation, but for the forces of socialisation to work along the same lines as pre-existing biological forces would suggest that socialisation is at most a feedback loop between biology and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of brain areas that differed structurally between the sexes, but it would be irresponsible to draw any firm conclusions about what they might mean for function and behaviour. For instance, what could differences in overall insula size possibly mean psychologically when the area is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex&quot;&gt;“compassion and empathy, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning”, “interpersonal experience” and “psychopathology”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the new research is helpful is because it informs the interpretation of more focused studies that uncover psychological differences between the sexes. Imagine that researchers studying the treatment of anxiety find a sex-related difference in the stress response (as has happened in reality). If this difference is due entirely to sexist social structures that we’re already attempting to tear down, then the finding is not so important. But if that sex-linked difference in stress response is shown to be associated with sex-linked variation in amygdala size/structure, then the fact these anatomical differences exist so early – as shown by the current paper – makes it more plausible that the different ways men and women respond to stress is going to be hard to shake, even after social reform. Attempts to make society fairer are more likely to succeed with these facts in mind, rather than hoping they will go away.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5225</id>
		<updated>2018-01-30T23:24:39+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-5226&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/people-2567826_1280-1024x657.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interest in meditation and mindfulness as ways to reduce stress have exploded in popularity, and they’re great tools to have in your mental health toolkit. But what if these techniques don’t work for you? Here are some practical alternatives to switching off your stress response and finding peace of mind.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all stress is bad. We need an optimum level of stress to function effectively. Positive or beneficial stress is called ‘eustress’ and is defined by how you perceive that stressor. For example, what may be a negative threat to one person (e.g. sitting a test) may be perceived as a  positive challenge to another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, excessive or chronic levels of stress or ‘distress’ negatively affect both our physical and mental health. Too much distress is associated with autoimmune diseases, migraines, obesity, muscle tension and backache, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t avoid all sources of stress in our lives, nor would we want to. But we can develop healthier ways of responding. Learning to ‘switch off’ your stress response and ‘switch on’ your relaxation response is key to promoting mental health and physical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people practise meditation to reduce psychological stress and stress-related health problems. Popular meditation techniques include transcendental meditation, which emphasises the use of a mantra; or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which emphasises training in present-focused awareness or ‘mindfulness’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence to support MBSR as a stress-reduction tool. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine &lt;/em&gt;pooled data from 47 trials of the health effects of meditation programs on over 3,500 people. After carefully controlling for the placebo effect, the authors found that MBSR resulted in moderate improvements in anxiety, depression and pain. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 2668 healthy individuals in 29 different studies found large buffering effects of MBSR against stress, moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life, and small effects on burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its lauded benefits, meditation is not everyone’s cup of tea. Perhaps you don’t have the time or resources to attend an eight-week MBSR course, or you’re in need of immediate mental health first aid. Or, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/does-meditation-stress-you-out-heres-what-i-do-instead/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like me&lt;/a&gt;, you struggle with the practice thereby inadvertently&lt;em&gt; increasing&lt;/em&gt; your distress? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/default-source/psychological-toolkit/relaxationtechniques.pdf?sfvrsn=10&quot;&gt;Black Dog Insitute&lt;/a&gt; recognises some people also encounter problems with ‘letting go’ and can become panicky when they try and relax. Because different stress management techniques appeal to different people, here are five simple evidence-based alternatives to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify your triggers.&lt;/strong&gt; Make a list of events that leave you emotionally drained, with one or two ways to reduce the stress for each. When they occur, use them as an opportunity to practise your stress reduction techniques, then, keep notes on what works for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk in nature.&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle repetitive exercise such as walking, swimming, and cycling are good to relieve stress and can be thought of like &lt;em&gt;meditation in motion&lt;/em&gt;. Exercise works most effectively to reduce stress when done away from urban settings in natural environments such as forests. Exposure to natural environments can also improve mood, reduce blood pressure and heart activity and improve your ability to concentrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathe in a box.&lt;/strong&gt; Slow, deep-breathing exercises evoke the relaxation response. One useful way to practice deep breathing is to use the ‘box breathing’ technique: &lt;em&gt;Breath in for four seconds. Hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds. Then pause for four seconds before taking your next breath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax, muscle by muscle.&lt;/strong&gt; In progressive muscle relaxation, you tense up particular muscles and then relax them. Starting with the muscles in your legs and gradually work your way up your body. Tense each muscle group in turn. Make sure you can feel the tension, but not so much that you feel a great deal of pain. Keep the muscle tensed for about five seconds. Relax the muscles and keep them relaxed for approximately 10 seconds. It may be helpful to say something like “Relax” as you relax the muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to music.&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to music can have a tremendously relaxing effect on the mind and body. Slow, quiet classical music can slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and decrease levels of stress hormones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/shutterstock-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0388-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in people living with HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of pain in women living with HIV/AIDS may differ from that of men as many chronic pain conditions are more prevalent in women than in men. This higher prevalence rate may be a reflection of cultural acceptance for women to report pain, but it may also be a consequence of differences in physiology between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9832&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9832&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/parker-300x213.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure taken from Parker, Jelsma and Stein, 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker, Jelsma and Stein investigated pain prevalence, characteristics and management in 229 amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS. Almost 75% of the women interviewed reported pain, with the most frequently reported regions being the head/neck, followed by the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that pain risk is not purely due to the fact that being female increases risk for developing pain. Research finds that socio-economic status has also been identified as a risk factor for pain. More than half of the women in the study were unemployed (66%), while other studies have identified low levels of education as increasing risk for pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is a common problem for amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS, but routine pain assessments could aid the management of pain and the psychiatric comorbidities that accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0377-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to live with osteoporosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a chronic condition that can lead to bone fractures and become debilitating if left untreated, but it is highly treatable in healthy individuals. A diagnosis of osteoporosis allows initiation of treatment before bone fractures occur, but the diagnosis itself can lead to difficulties for patients, who therefore may not follow the prescribed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hansen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; conducted a longitudinal qualitative study to explore patients’ experience of osteoporosis in the first year after diagnosis in order to understand where improvements in treatment could be helpful. The longitudinal nature of the study allowed for an in-depth understanding of the evolving process of learning to live with new life circumstances after a diagnosis of osteoporosis. They found that the decision to initiate, continue, or discontinue medication was a key theme of the women’s experiences. The results highlight the need for shared decision-making to increase compliance and improve outcomes for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0370-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How hormone therapy affects quality of life and breast cancer risk after surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a systematic review conducted by Siyam &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;investigated the effect of hormone therapy on quality of life and breast cancer risk after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), a surgery involving the removal of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that several studies show the benefits of hormone therapy improving menopause-specific quality of life in symptomatic women who have gone through natural or surgical menopause. However, they were unable to draw conclusions relating to the safety of hormone therapy in relating to breast cancer risk, due to the lack of long-term studies available from which to draw conclusions. The authors urge the implementation of more well-designed randomized control trials in order to inform the use of hormone therapy post-RRSO, and in the interim, clinicians and patients must carefully discuss the potential benefits of hormone therapy in improving quality of life, in the context of the unknown risk of breast cancer in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0479-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male attitudes and experiences towards conflict-related sexual violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9834&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9834&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/shutterstock2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image from Shutterstock, by MikeDotta&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the female survivors of sexual violence, the consequences of are not purely physical; many survivors face negative social outcomes, such as rejection by their family or community. Survivors of sexual violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (where this study took place) have stated that the stigma and shame they feel after rape can be more traumatic than the attack itself, due to these adverse societal results. Recent research has found that male relatives play a critical role in how the community responds to the survivor of this violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;investigated, through the use of focus groups, the sensitive questions surrounding spousal acceptance and rejection after an instance of sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results highlight the complexity of the topic, and how an interaction of factors affects the acceptance/rejection of a survivor of sexual violence. One the topic of “love and affection”, two contradictory views can be seen. The first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As I was in deep love with her, my decision came easily to keep her”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Even if you love your wife, if you see her be raped, the love vanishes” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the drivers of rejection included the fear of sexually transmitted infections, the personal stigmatization and social isolation of men and the financial or logistical inability to provide adequate healthcare for survivors. Love and affection, financial contributions by the survivors, and children in the home were described as pathways to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0406-y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of male circumcision for women in Papua New Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been found that male circumcision has the potential to reduce the risk of female-to-male transmission of HIV, and as such, is now being investigated as a possible HIV prevention technique in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a three-phase study conducted by Redman-MacLaren &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;the researchers first investigated women’s understanding of and experience of male circumcision. In the second part of the study, focus groups with women were employed to understand the processes women use to manage the outcomes of male circumcision. Lastly, participants helped identify local-level actions that could assist in HIV policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the focus group, the researchers found higher educational level was associated with women having more choice relating to whether a man’s circumcision would influence with whom they will have intimate relationships, as well as whether they will push for their sons to be circumcised. Regarding the latter, one woman interviewed said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “I wasn’t aware of that, now that I’m aware, believe me, I’m going to have all my boys in my family, I will do it and I’m gonna do it. I will have to get them circumcised, that’s it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research found that women in Papua New Guinea are very knowledgeable on the topic of male circumcision, despite the idea of it being “men’s business.” However, women’s opinions regarding male circumcision is often related to a lack of safety, a consequence of a lack of opportunities for education and gender inequality in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;Rouault et al&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers hope that focusing on the cognitive, neural, genetic and social processes that contribute to symptom dimensions – like anxiety-depression or social withdrawal – may be more fruitful than trying to understand the causes of different diagnostic categories, like “schizophrenia” or “major depression”. It’s in this vein that a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; has used a simple perceptual task to investigate how judgment confidence, judgment accuracy and metacognition (judgment insight) are related to various trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions in the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33131&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across two experiments, Marion Rouault at UCL and her colleagues asked nearly a thousand participants recruited online to complete surveys about their experience of various psychiatric symptoms, from impulsivity to anxiety to schizotypy. The researchers looked for correlations between different symptoms and found that they grouped into three key dimensions: anxiety and depression, compulsive behaviour and intrusive thoughts, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants all performed the same perceptual judgment many dozens of times: decide which of two adjacent boxes contained the most dots, and they rated their confidence in each decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they judged each pair of boxes, the participants weren’t given any feedback on their performance. However, in the second experiment, the task difficulty was continually adjusted for each participant so that their accuracy was kept constant and comparable to other participants (this was so the researchers could examine participants’ confidence and insight into their own judgment accuracy independent of their actual perceptual ability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants’ experience of different mental health symptoms was not related to their accuracy at the perceptual task (unlike older age and lower IQ, which were both related to poorer accuracy, as you might expect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, however,  participants who scored higher on the anxiety-depression symptom dimension showed a consistent tendency towards being less confident in their judgments, and yet they showed more accurate metacognition – that is, their confidence more appropriately tracked their actual accuracy from one trial to the next. Perhaps in everyday life this blend of bias and insight might manifest as pessimism and harshly honest self-evaluation (which could contribute to problems in everyday life when you consider that sometimes a little over-confidence can give us the impetus to tackle important challenges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants who scored higher on the “compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought” symptom dimension showed the opposite pattern – they were consistently more confident in their judgments, yet showed less accurate metacognition. This symptom dimension is shared by people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia, OCD and eating disorders, and one can imagine the mix of over-confidence and lack of insight playing out in everyday life in terms of jumping to conclusions and holding harmful convictions about the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reveal that shifts in metacognitive evaluation represent a specific and pervasive behavioral correlate of subclinical psychopathology,” the researchers said, adding that, “…The anxiety-depression and compulsive behaviour-intrusive thought dimensions show equal and opposite relationships between two key aspects of metacognition – confidence and meta-cognitive accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a methodological perspective, it’s notable that these patterns would have remained hidden if, rather than looking at symptom dimensions, the researchers had used participants’ scores on questionnaires tapping specific symptoms and diagnostic categories in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study should be considered preliminary. The sample was from the general public and the researchers relied on the participants’ reports of their own symptoms. The findings might be different with clinical samples. It also remains to be seen if the symptom-related patterns of confidence and insight uncovered here would apply to other contexts beyond the specific perceptual task that was used. The researchers predict they will: “Recent evidence points towards metacognition relying in part on domain-general resources, suggesting that the findings from the current study are likely to generalise to other scenarios,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;Psychiatric symptom dimensions are associated with dissociable shifts in metacognition but not task performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are words written by Dyche Mullins and Peter Walter, in 2016. Walter is one of this year’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/12/409186/biochemist-peter-walter-receives-2018-breakthrough-prize-life-sciences&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Life Sciences &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/01/life-science-breakthrough-prize-2018/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recipients&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and a leader in the scientific community not only for his scientific investigations but also for his continuous dedication to mentoring and teaching younger scientists, and for taking a progressive but circumspect stand on issues that impact the quality of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2016/12/09/non-model-models-pre-print-servers-fruit-translational-tree/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scientific life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As a follow-up to last month’s Breakthrough Prize overview, PLOS interviewed Walter on some of the broader issues surrounding his work and publishing in general. Walter has strong opinions related to impact factors and Open Access; he remains open minded regarding preprints. His valuable and modest insights are below, with minimal editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS: &lt;/strong&gt;Which of your &lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Walter_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were most impactful for your work related to the prize, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The Brickner and Walter paper [“&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020342&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gene Recruitment of the Activated &lt;em&gt;INO1&lt;/em&gt; Locus to the Nuclear Membrane&lt;/a&gt;”] stands out, in my view, as this story organically grew out of our ongoing work on the unfolded protein response, yet opened an entirely new field: that the physical location of a genetic locus inside the nucleus can be dynamic and affect gene regulation. This paper also served to seed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/jason-brickner.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Brickner’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; independent career: Shortly after this publication, he was recruited to Northwestern University. Since then, his lab has vastly expanded upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050081&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he is now internationally recognized as one of the very leaders of cell biological mechanisms that control &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001524&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;transcriptional memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have a personal favorite among your PLOS publications? Perhaps one that was either controversial or that sparked scientific debate/conversation at time of publication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The Pincus et al. paper [“&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000415&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BiP Binding to the ER-Stress Sensor Ire1 Tunes the Homeostatic Behavior of the Unfolded Protein Response&lt;/a&gt;”] is one of my all-time favorites: It demonstrates the power of computational modeling for generating new hypotheses and then experimentally testing them. In this case, modeling suggested experiments that we would not have thought of otherwise, and the results showed beyond reasonable doubt that BiP dissociation from the ER-resident stress sensor Ire1 is not the regulatory switch that activates the UPR. The work inspired rethinking, and it is now clear that in both, yeast and metazoans, unfolded proteins per se are agonists that bind directly to the stress sensors Ire1 (and PERK). Despite the seminal insights provided in this publication, the field remains attached to the notion that BiP dissociation is causal for Ire1 activation—providing an important insight into the surprisingly inflexible thinking of established scientists (including myself, at times…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; In your experience speaking with the public or non-scientists in general, what concept(s) about the unfolded protein response pathway do they typically find most interesting or resonates strongly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; Trained as a chemist, I personally cherish the many unorthodox molecular mechanisms by which the unfolded protein response regulates ER [endoplasmic reticulum] homeostasis. However, beauty at a molecular scale is mostly appreciated by aficionados and only rarely resonates with the public and non-scientists. We are now in a most fortunate era where our work tangibly links to a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, where our knowledge has become foundational to the exploration of new treatment strategies. &lt;strong&gt;As such, our work provides a wonderful platform on which to demonstrate the power and value to society of curiosity-driven research in which we seek understanding of how healthy cells work in disease-agnostic approaches and then use that knowledge to learn what goes wrong in disease and how to fix it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Our readers span the range of career stages. What is your opinion of the value or challenge to publishing in Open Access journals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The challenge for the next generation of researchers is to break out of the stranglehold that the for-profit publishing industry has put on our community. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/06/impact-factor-genie-back-in-the-box/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;misguided emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on abstruse metrics, e.g., impact factor, in addition to the poorly transparent review procedures by our “vanity journals” and their hand-me-down cousins distort our most fundamental values. My colleagues and I have clearly laid out our views on this topic [in addition to the ASCB Newsletter referenced in the opening quote see the commentary co-authored with Martin Raff and Alexander Johnson, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5885/36.1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Painful Publishing&lt;/a&gt;”].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with scientific models, old patterns are hard to break. We need our young scientists to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2017/09/01/bullied-into-going-national-early-career-researchers-are-taking-initiative/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recapture control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The myth that one can only get a job/grant/promotion with [high impact factor journal] papers has been debunked internationally (e.g., Jason Brickner and &lt;a href=&quot;http://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/faculty/faculty/4161.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liang Ge in China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The challenge ahead is to spread the word and make sure that no young scientist who made an important discovery will ever be held back by the name of the journal where &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/ecrs-and-forbes-30-under-30/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ground breaking findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-access and publishing (to “make public”) are synonymous in my view, and scientist-run non-profit open-access journals that manage to deliver consistently customer-friendly, transparent, and constructive reviews and timely feedback are destined to lead the movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, have you or collaborator ever posted a preprint? If not, would you consider doing so, and why/why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; To date, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/24/222257&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;posted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/04/239830&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—I consider them experiments with the new forum. For now, I remain agnostic to the process. Science is moving fast enough for my taste (if not too fast sometimes), and I remain unsure whether an invitation to put un-reviewed stories out there will be that beneficial overall. Many things will need to be worked out: Does a preprint establish priority for a discovery? How will “better-first-and-sloppy-than-second-and-who-cares” science be regarded by the community? How will we deal with predatory scientists who appropriate ideas and results from our students or postdocs and then race to scoop them? Also, personally, I read most papers only once, and it is the first impression that sticks. The concept of looking at evolving versions rather than a final, best-as-can-be product is rather vulnerable in my opinion. We’ll see; I remain open-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Newly minted scientists are encouraged to use preprints as a way of, as Walter recommends, recapturing control. The cartoon above on use ideas for preprints from the group &lt;a href=&quot;https://prereview.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREreview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5807478.v1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;download on figshare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the last 5 years have seen a rapid growth of a variety of openly available resources for neuronal modelling, with a particular focus on open access to software, models and simulation and experimental data. I will give an overview of resources that are currently available and present a selection of simulators for neuronal modelling at different levels of detail, computational and experimental databases, tools for the generation and analysis of neuronal morphologies and interoperability frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego depletion is the notion that willpower is a fuel that gets burned away by effort, and once it burns low we lose our focus and bow to our immediate desires. However, this once dominant theory has recently come into question, thanks in part to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-12718-004&quot;&gt;large-scale replication&lt;/a&gt; that failed to find an ego-depletion effect and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4115664/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that argued that the size of the effect is minimal. Complicating the picture, other &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&quot;&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; have provided a strong demonstration of the effect. But now researchers from Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz have released &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pvefx/&quot;&gt;a pre-print at PsyArxiv&lt;/a&gt; in which they suggest the debates over the size of the ego-depletion effect are missing the point because when you look over the long-term, ego depletion becomes meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33123&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Mario Wenzel, built experiments around the classic ego-depletion design: some participants performed an initial mentally demanding task designed to make them ego-depleted whereas others acted as controls and performed a low-effort version. Next, all participants performed a second mentally demanding task. Poorer performance on this second task by the ego-depleted group, as compared with the controls, was taken as evidence of ego depletion. However, unlike in most previous research, Wenzel and his colleagues had their participants repeat these pairs of tasks several times, to see if any effects of ego depletion would accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first experiment, the researchers asked their participants to start by completing a difficult or easy version of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). This involved quickly responding to simple stimuli on a computer screen by pressing the button corresponding to the odd one out. The 18 student participants in the control group started with a dead easy version that involved displays like “xx1” with an obvious odd-one-out, whereas the 46 students in the ego-depletion condition completed a harder version that involved responding to whichever digit was the odd-one-out based purely on its colour, while ignoring the uniqueness or not of its numerical value (such as the red “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” in arrays like “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;42”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, all the participants completed the same second task, which was another colour version of the MSIT – only this time colours had to be ignored entirely, just focusing on the odd number out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once participants had done the initial and second tasks, they started again, completing another pair of MSIT tasks – and then repeated this in a third “block” of tasks, then again in a fourth. If willpower was being used up by these tasks, you would expect performance to deteriorate even more in the later blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if anything, the results were the other way around. Wenzel’s team found that the ego-depletion effect was largest in the first block and then diminished (across the four blocks, in statistical terms the effect sizes were very small, from .065 to .001, and mostly non-significant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second experiment with 93 students, the researchers pushed the time horizon further, to see if the fuel needle would finally hit empty. This time there were 12 “blocks” involving various pairs of tasks, with the second task always the classic Stroop test (in which participants must identify the font colour of colour-denoting words, such as “red” written in blue ink). For instance, participants might do one of the MSITs paired with the the Stroop, then a version of the &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:http%25253A//www.impulsivity.org/measurement/cued_Go_NoGo&quot;&gt;Go-No-Go task&lt;/a&gt; paired with the Stroop, then a copying task paired with the Stroop, and so on. When participants were being hit with the harder versions of the initial tasks, how did their Stroop performance fare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed (as they did in the first experiment) that the hard versions of the preliminary tasks required more self-control. But again, over the course of the blocks, any evidence of ego depletion, in terms of greater declining performance among the participants completing the harder initial tasks, turned out to be small and statistically non-significant – this despite the fact that mild ego depletion often did show up during the very first block. In other words, the ego-depletion effect did the opposite of what we might expect – if anything, participants’ willpower replenished over time (a finding that’s similar to the recently documented example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/12/reverse-ego-depletion-people-in-india-find-mental-effort-energising/&quot;&gt;reverse ego depletion&lt;/a&gt; in India).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conceded that part of the explanation may be an effect of practice (even in the second experiment that used a mix of tasks to counteract this possibility). Maybe tackling a mix of effortful tasks that occasionally repeat is something you ease into after a bit. But this doesn’t really let ego depletion off the hook: if it only adds up to anything in the narrow window between starting a task and getting to grips with it, it can’t be all that important – and would seem to have little bearing on the domains that it has been associated with, such as keeping up the willpower to get in shape, pass your finals, or stay off the cigarettes. In this pre-print paper, which has been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, the researchers recommend that we focus a little more attention on the mechanisms that matter for life-sized timespans, and less on laboratory-induced blips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pvefx/&quot;&gt;Practice conquers it all: Even if the ego depletion effect is genuine, it may not be relevant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Cancer-cells-red_iStock-Photoresized-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights in 2017 was a review written by one of our own Consulting Editors, Prof. Steve Povoski: ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3444-9&quot;&gt;A comprehensive overview on the surgical management of secondary lymphedema of the upper and lower extremities related to prior oncologic therapies&lt;/a&gt;’. Oncologic therapies including surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may lead to secondary lymphedema, a major factor in long term morbidity in cancer sufferers. Lymphodema arises from a collection of ‘protein rich extracellular fluid within the interstitial compartment of tissues that arises from an imbalance of lymph production and lymph transport to the systemic circulation’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologic therapies for Gynaecologic, urologic cancers, melanoma and lymphoma are mostly associated with lymphedema of the lower extremities, those for breast cancer with the upper extremities. This is a side effect which is currently being addressed by both surgical and non-surgical techniques. Further research aims to find solutions for lymphedema which is understood to affect 90 million people worldwide from a variety of causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific gene involvement in cancers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3134-7&quot;&gt;Testis specific Y-like 5: gene expression, methylation and implications for drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; was published in February and described Testis specific Y-like 5 (TSPYL5), a putative tumor suppressor gene, belonging to the nucleosome assembly protein family. The gene is located at 8Q22.1 though its exact role in prostate cancer disease is not fully defined. The study investigated gene expression and methylation levels of TSPYL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Methylation of this gene in tumor tissues correlated inversely with its mRNA and protein expression.’ The authors proposed that this gene could be an indicator of more advanced prostate cancer as its gene product is seen in reduced amounts in tumors with high &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/prostate-pathology/prostate-cancer-pathology.html&quot;&gt;Gleason Scores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9801 alignright&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Cancer-cell-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use the immune system for treatment and cure of disease is a dream of many physicians. In December, the authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3854-8&quot;&gt;Expitope 2.0: a tool to assess immunotherapeutic antigens for their potential cross-reactivity against naturally expressed proteins in human tissues&lt;/a&gt; published a new and improved version of their tool, which aims to help immunotherapy develop. This web tool provides prediction of cross reactivity of T cell epitopes, ‘based on experimental protein abundance and expression data obtained from a growing number of publicly available databases.’ See &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3854-8#Sec3&quot;&gt;Table 1 included here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frishman group shows the variability of cross reactivity to presented peptides appears to depend on different health states. Cross reactivity is approximately 5-fold higher in individuals with cancer than those of good health. The similarity of presented peptides to self –antigens ‘is an obstacle for disease elimination both for the organism itself and for immunotherapy.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New compounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3085-z&quot;&gt;Dyshlovoy et al.&lt;/a&gt; illustrates well the diversity of topics covered in &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer. &lt;/em&gt;Urothelial cancers are hard to treat but these authors discovered that&lt;em&gt; ‘&lt;/em&gt;The marine triterpene glycoside frondoside A induces p53-independent apoptosis and inhibits autophagy in urothelial carcinoma cells’. The compound frondoside A (FrA), isolated from the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa induces apoptosis without the need for active caspases and p53; inhibits pro-survival autophagy; and demonstrates increased activity when used in combination with classical cytotoxic agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final article included here has been very popular. Having  an Altmetric attention score of 425, ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3375-5&quot;&gt;Calretinin as a blood-based biomarker for mesothelioma’&lt;/a&gt; was published in May 2017. The authors used a case-control design to ask their specific questions regarding the usefulness of calretinin as a biomarker for malignant mesothelioma (MM) which is a deadly cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. They concluded that calretinin has a similar performance in detecting MM (except the sarcomoid subtype) as Mesothelin, the gold standard. They propose that Calretinin be added to a panel of biomarkers with mesothelin for validation of these markers in a prospective cohort study. The hopes would be that a panel of biomarkers would be developed and used in surveillance programmes of workers with former exposure to asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have launched a cross-journal thematic series. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/collections/call-for-papers-car-immunotherapy&quot;&gt;Call for papers&lt;/a&gt; introduces Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, already important in haematological malignancies and hoped to become standard therapies in the clinic. The series is entitled ’The Advances of CAR Immunotherapy within Oncology Clinics’ and is accepting submissions until the end of June 2018. The three guest editors are: Profs Marko Radic, Djordje Atanackovic and Tim Luetkens.&lt;/p&gt;

Twelve years! During this time, I've managed to remain a mysterious pseudonym to almost everyone. Very few people know who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a lot has changed since then. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Center for Open Science&quot;&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt; movement, the rise of multiple platforms for critique, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612465253&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Editors' Introduction to the Special Section on Replicability in Psychological Science: A Crisis of Confidence?&quot;&gt;Replication Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in social psychology, the emergence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/9zubbn9fyi1xjcu/Fiske%20presidential%20guest%20column_APS%20Observer_copy-edited.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Susan Fiske APS presidential guest column&quot;&gt;methodological terrorists, data police, and destructo-critics&lt;/a&gt;. Assertive psychologists and statisticians with large social media presences have openly criticized flawed studies using much harsher language than I do. Using their own names. It's hard to stay relevant... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a pseudonym now seems quaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most famous neuro-pseudonym of all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt;, interviewed me 2 years ago in a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/2016/03/21/pseudonyms-in-science-neuroskeptic-speaks-to-neurocritic-dr-primestein-and-neurobonkers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Pseudonyms in Science: Neuroskeptic speaks to Neurocritic, Dr Primestein and Neurobonkers&quot;&gt;Pseudonyms in Science&lt;/a&gt;. He asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What led you to choose to blog under a pseudonym?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My answer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;It was for exactly the same reason that reviewers of papers and grants are anonymous: it gives you the ability to provide an honest critique without fear of retaliation. If peer review ever becomes completely open and transparent, then I’d have no need for a pseudonym any more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an ideal world, reviewers should be identified and held accountable for what they write. Then shoddy reviews and nasty comments would (presumably) become less common. We’ve all seen anonymous reviews that are incredibly insulting, mean, and unprofessional. So it’s hypocritical to say that bloggers are cowardly for hiding under pseudonyms, while staunchly upholding the institution of anonymous peer review. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroskeptic also interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurobonkers.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Simon Oxenham&quot;&gt;Neurobonkers&lt;/a&gt; (who went public) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psi-chology.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Primestein&lt;/a&gt; (who has not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you ever been tempted to drop the pseudonym and use your real name? What do you think would happen (positive and negative if you did?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My answer: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to drop the pseudonym, it might be good (and bad) for my career as a neuroscientist. I could finally take credit for my writing, but then I’d have to take all the blame too! But overall, it’s likely that less would happen than I currently imagine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{At this point, most people probably don't care who I am.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what has changed? Have I left the field? No. But some serious and tragic life events have rendered my anonymity irrelevant. I just don't care any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September, my closest childhood friend died from cancer (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-adI_yfXIYgo/Wm1CWFvZlPI/AAAAAAAAMbI/ITTpau4x-TkoDyD042Vj-iunx7nucqyjwCLcBGAs/s1600/carrowinds.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;244&quot; data-original-width=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-adI_yfXIYgo/Wm1CWFvZlPI/AAAAAAAAMbI/ITTpau4x-TkoDyD042Vj-iunx7nucqyjwCLcBGAs/s1600/carrowinds.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm on the right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a month later, my wife was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.

 &quot;Social priming&quot; has recently been one of the most controversial topics in psychological science. With failures to replicate proliferating, the field has been called a train-wreck. But what exactly is it?





Here's how I defined social priming in a 2016 post:
“Social priming” has been the punching-bag of psychology for the past few years.

The term “social priming” refers to the idea that subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on human behaviour. The classic example of a</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9814 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Previous studies have investigated the life expectancy of elite athletes compared to that of the general population. These studies have found that, while the majority of elite athletes to live longer than the general public, this is not the case in all sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study by Lee-Heidenreich and colleagues attempted to identify any variations in life expectancy within athletics events. They analyzed the death dates of the top 20 males and females in various track and field athletics events such as: the Olympic high jump, discus, marathon and 100m sprint from the years 1928–1948. Their results revealed that life expectancy did vary by event, with high-jumpers and marathon runners living longer than discus throwers and sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Olympic medalists were found to have a higher life expectancy than the general population regardless of country, whereas 100m runners did not live longer than the general population. The authors suggest that future studies are needed to determine if there are differences in cause-specific mortality (e.g. cardiovascular disease) between different types of elite athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9815&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;There are many ways that an athlete can recover after exercise, but what methods are the most popular? A study carried out by Fiona Crowther and colleagues from James Cook University in Australia surveyed the preferred recovery methods of 331 athletes from levels ranging from local to international. They found that all international athletes used massage as a form of recovery, whereas the most popular method of recovery overall was stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the majority of participants did undertake recovery techniques, these did not always align with scientific evidence on the most efficient recovery technique. Consequently, it is important that athletes and coaching staff are informed about the effects of different techniques to ensure recovery strategies are selected and implemented for the correct reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0076-y&quot;&gt;The influence of a Healthy Welcoming Environment on participation in club sport by adolescent girls: a longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9817&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-4-300x214.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Currently, four out of five adolescents do not achieve the recommended levels of physical activity per day, particularly adolescent girls, who are significantly less active than their male counterparts. Why is this? And how do you increase adolescent participation in sport?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and address these questions, Casey and co-workers investigated the role that a healthy welcoming environment had on the participation in sports clubs of two groups of secondary school girls. They collected information on the sports membership of female students in years 7 (aged 11-13 years) and 11 (aged 16-18 years) and recorded the factors that influenced their decision to take part in sport. The results indicated that 80% of participants rated the welcoming atmosphere of the club (knowing someone at the club/friendliness of the coach) as an important factor, whereas the healthy environment of the club was found to be significantly less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some welcoming strategies suggested by the authors include: a designated club ambassador who is responsible for meeting new members, a club induction, club events, and linking new members with a peer mentor. Consequently sporting bodies should consider prioritizing the social environment within sports clubs in order to increase sports participation in adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0084-y&quot;&gt;Are we missing opportunities? Physiotherapy and physical activity promotion: a cross-sectional survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9820&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-7-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Physiotherapists are in an ideal position to promote physical activity (PA); however, there is little evidence that this occurs. To investigate this, Nicole Freene, Sophie Cools and Bernie Bissett from the University of Canberra (Australia) surveyed a total of 257 Australian physiotherapists to determine how frequently they promoted PA and to assess their knowledge of the Australian physical activity and sedentary behavior (PASB) guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of participants agreed that the promotion of PA was part of their role, the results found that only half of the participants promoted PA beyond therapeutic exercise to 10 or more patients per month. Furthermore, male physiotherapists were significantly more likely to promote PA than female physiotherapists. The study also found that the participants generally had a poor knowledge of the Australian (PASB) guidelines, with only a small percentage being able to accurately state all four components of the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these findings, it is apparent that that further education on the Australian PASB guidelines may allow physiotherapists to promote PA more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0075-z&quot;&gt;Are there two forms of isometric muscle action? Results of the experimental study support a distinction between a holding and a pushing isometric muscle function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9819&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-5-300x281.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current research regarding isometric (static) muscle action is limited, but it has been suggested that two forms of isometric action could exist: (i) holding isometric muscle action (HIMA), where an applied external load is held in a static position, and (ii) pushing isometric muscle action (PIMA), where the subject pushes against or pulls at a resistance that equals the force exerted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, Laura Schaefer and Frank Bittmann (University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany) measured various parameters in the triceps brachii muscle of 10 healthy participants while they performed both a pushing and a holding exercise. Their study found a variation between the two muscle actions in regards to force endurance, the power at particular frequencies and time to exhaustion (as HIMA was found to cause the muscle to exhaust more rapidly than PIMA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for this variation is that the neuronal control strategies and muscle physiological aspects in HIMA more closely resemble an eccentric muscle action, while PIMA could be more similar to a concentric muscle action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results partially support the theory that there are two types of isometric muscle action; however, further research is required regarding the cause of variation between the two muscle actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9821&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-6-300x177.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Some people may believe that intense exercising every day is the best way to get fit; however, excessive training and insufficient recovery in sport can lead to overtraining syndrome (OTS). OTS causes acute feelings of fatigue and decreased performance, but can be hard to diagnose as it can be triggered by a variety of factors including hormonal, metabolic and immune dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using PRISMA guidelines, Cadegiani and Kater performed a systematic review to investigate the hormonal aspects of OTS as a potential diagnostic tool. They found that basal levels of hormones were not a good indicator of overtraining, whereas growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) responses were blunted during stimulation tests undertaken by the affected individuals. Further research is required, but the study indicates that GH and ACTH responses may be useful predictors in the diagnosis of OTS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A pharmacy journal has retracted a 2017 cancer paper after determining that the lead author forged her co-author’s signature. Alain Li Wan Po, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics, told Retraction Watch that, after discovering the forgery, the journal lost confidence in “the integrity of the whole report,” and decided to retract […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are examples of extremely intelligent individuals with strong religious convictions. But various studies have found that, on average, belief in God is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Relation-Between-Intelligence-and-Religiosity-A-Meta-Analysis-and-Some-Proposed-Explanations.pdf&quot;&gt;lower scores on IQ tests&lt;/a&gt;. “It is well established that religiosity correlates inversely with intelligence,” note Richard Daws and Adam Hampshire at Imperial College London, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, which seeks to explore why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a question with some urgency – the proportion of people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/&quot;&gt;with a religious belief is growing&lt;/a&gt;: by 2050, if current trends continue, people who say they are not religious will make up only 13 per cent of the global population. Based on the low-IQ-religiosity link, it could be argued that humanity is on course to become collectively less smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33084&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion is that perhaps religious people tend to rely more on intuition. So, rather than having impaired general intelligence, they might be comparatively poor only on tasks in which intuition and logic come into conflict – and this might explain the lower overall IQ test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, Daws and Hampshire surveyed more than 63,000 people online, and had them complete a 30-minute set of 12 cognitive tasks that measured planning, reasoning, attention and working memory. The participants also indicated whether they were religious, agnostic or atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the atheists performed better overall than the religious participants, even after controlling for demographic factors like age and education. Agnostics tended to place between atheists and believers on all tasks. In fact, strength of religious conviction correlated with poorer cognitive performance. However, while the religious respondents performed worse overall on tasks that required reasoning, there were only very small differences in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, some of the reasoning tasks, such as an extra-hard version of the Stroop Task known as “colour-word remapping”, had been designed to create maximum conflict between an intuitive response and a logical one, and the biggest group differences emerged on these tasks, consistent with the idea that religious people rely more on their intuition. In contrast, for a complex reasoning task – “deductive reasoning” – for which there were no obviously intuitive answers, there was much less of a group difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daws and Hampshire concluded: “These findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the religiosity effect relates to conflict [between reasoning and intuition] as opposed to reasoning ability or intelligence more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as this work suggests, religious belief predisposes people to rely more heavily on intuition in decision-making – and the stronger their belief, the more pronounced the impact – how much of a difference does this make to actual achievement in the real world? At the moment, there’s no data on this. But in theory, perhaps cognitive training could allow religious people to maintain their beliefs without over-relying on intuition when it conflicts with logic in day to day decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191/full&quot;&gt;The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the difficulties they have liking themselves, people with low self-esteem also tend to have poorer relationships. Previous investigations into why this may be haven’t made easy reading for the self-doubters. For instance, while they tend to claim that their partners have more negative views of them and love them less (than do people with more typical self-esteem), studies of their partners simply haven’t backed this up. This suggests that the neurotic and needy are projecting their insecurities and imperilling their relationships in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not the end of the story. People with low self-esteem also tend to report that, when they need them most, their partners are poor at responding and being supportive. Is this all in their heads too? Not according to a series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12370/abstract&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;, by Kassandra Cortes and Joanne Wood at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until this point, researchers have pointed the finger at LSEs [those with low self-esteem] as the likely cause for their lower quality relationships … However, our data suggest that LSEs may not be the only culprits,” Cortes and Wood conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33075&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers started by recruiting 122 romantic student couples and had everyone complete a self-esteem questionnaire. Next, the couples were divided in two. One partner from each pair was asked about times they’d disclosed bad news to their partner and how their partner had responded. The other partners – the “listeners” – were asked to recall times that they’d listened and responded to their partner’s bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, among the participants who recalled their past disclosures, those with low self-esteem tended to describe having less responsive partners. Crucially, this seemed to be corroborated by the participants in the listener role, who recalled times they’d listened. Those listeners with a lower self-esteem partner described themselves as having been less understanding and attentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many problems with that first study – not least the possibility that people with low self-esteem tend to share bad news that is harder to sympathise with. To get around this, Cortes and Wood next invited dozens more romantic couples to the psych lab, measured their self-esteem, and then contrived a situation whereby one partner in each couple had the same bad experience – they were excluded in a simple video game called cyber ball (no one passed the ball to them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the rejected participants were reunited with their partners and secretly videoed telling them what had happened. When the researchers watched back the videos they found that the rejected participants with lower self-esteem received less support and understanding from their partners, again seeming to corroborate the claims of low self-esteem individuals that they don’t get much support or sympathy from their partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of why this should be, the researchers surveyed 99 more people online. They were asked to rate their partners’ self-esteem, to imagine that their partner had had a big fall out with a friend, and then to say how much support their partner would typically want in this kind of situation, and how their partner would typically go about sharing their bad news. The researchers compared the participants’ answers depending on whether they rated their partner as low or higher self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study asks us to place a lot of trust in the memories and interpretations of these participants, but if we take their answers at face value, they suggest that partners with low self-esteem want as much support and understanding, but that they go about sharing their bad news and their distress in a rather counter-productive way – for instance, they’ll be inconsistent, sometimes downplaying their feelings, sometimes exaggerating them. Or they’ll be indirect, acting as if something is wrong, but not saying why, as if expecting their partner to be a mind reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the findings from all three studies suggest that the consistent claim of people with low self-esteem that their partners are rather unresponsive has at least a grain of truth to it. However, it takes two to tango, and it seems those folk who are less assertive and self-confident probably don’t make it very easy for their partners to be responsive and supportive. Sometimes if you’re hurting and you want a shoulder to lean on, the best strategy is be transparent and to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortes and Wood believe their findings may have some practical implications: “Perhaps this research could lead to dyadic level interventions,” they said, “in which LSEs [low self-esteem people] are trained to improve their expression (making it easier for their partners to be responsive), and partners of LSEs are trained to be more responsive (so that LSEs may feel more secure in expressing openly in the future)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12370/abstract&quot;&gt;Is it really “all in their heads”? How self-esteem predicts partner responsiveness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/dna-1811955_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1632-x&quot;&gt;Sounding out the properties of DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many researchers are used to viewing DNA visually, in April researcher Mark D Temple presented a new way of identifying mutations by converting the code into musical notes. The sonification algorithms that converted the DNA code into music could very well represent a whole new way of finding mutations that would otherwise be missed. These algorithms represented DNA features using different sounds so that, for example, binding sites, restriction endonucleases sites and SNPs are each highlighted in their own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A song made from DNA may not be topping the charts any time soon but it could lead to new ways of exploring sequences and discovering features that would otherwise be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z&quot;&gt;ImageJ2: The next generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ImageJ has long been an immensely popular bioinformatics tool used in a wide variety of fields in both the biological and physical sciences. A huge, engaged community has developed to support and develop the software over the years but there comes a time when such successful software needs to be updated to be ready for the trials ahead. Curtis T. Rueden and his colleagues published ImageJ2 in November ready to meet the challenges posed by increasingly complex new datasets and to ensure that the software is capable of adapting to the future needs of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9794&quot; style=&quot;width: 344px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9794 &quot; height=&quot;237&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/12859_2017_1934_Fig1_HTML-300x213.gif&quot; width=&quot;334&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Examples of image processing algorithms in ImageJ&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Figure 1, Rueden et al, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software has been re-built from the ground up and expands upon the original ImageJ. It aims to continue to support the community while making sure it is free to develop and grow, exploring new avenues to work with other existing image processing tools. With the support and feedback of their enthusiastic community there’s no reason to think that ImageJ2 won’t continue to go from strength to strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1941-0&quot;&gt;Decontaminating DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years improving techniques and technology have allowed researchers to assemble a vast number of genomes. The first eukaryotic genome was published in 2000 and since then the speed with which genomes are assembled and published has greatly increased. However with such speed must also come some caution; how sure can we be that the target DNA is not contaminated with foreign DNA? In December 2017 Janna L. Fierst and Duncan A. Murdock presented a novel methodology using machine learning to help ensure that &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; assembled genome sequences are free of unwanted extraneous sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guaranteeing a sterile DNA sample is a major challenge in modern sequencing efforts. Foreign DNA can be acquired from microbiota, endosymbionts or even from laboratory tools or reagents. In order to ensure that we can draw solid conclusions from sequencing data we have to be sure that the data is what we think it is. A number of contamination errors have already been found in assembled sequences. Existing methods to reduce contamination errors do exist but can be prone to being too aggressive in removing sequences or only removing a number of potential sequences. The machine learning approach – using a decision tree – demonstrated in this research showed great potential for removing foreign sequences whilst maintaining the target DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1653-5&quot;&gt;Visualizing microbial dark matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICoVeR is a software tool than can visualise genomic fragment “bins” that can be reassembled to create draft microbial genomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-throughput sequencing has really come to the fore in recent years allowing for further exploration of so-called “microbial dark matter”: microbial communities which have proved resistant to attempts to cultivate them. Analyses of these communities have created large numbers of genomics fragments that need to be grouped together, or binned, in order to reassemble draft microbial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICoVeR is a software tool than can visualise genomic fragment “bins” that can be reassembled to create draft microbial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICoVeR (Interactive Contig-bin Verification and Refinement tool) is a new interactive visualisation software tool than can visualise these bins and perform further clustering as necessary. Its open design also means that it is easily updated with new algorithms and solutions to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1730-9&quot;&gt;Bioinformatics: indispensable, yet hidden in plain sight?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we highlight some correspondence by Bartett &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; exploring the relationship between bioinformatics and life sciences. Bioinformatics is seen as increasingly important in life sciences but the work is often not given due credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioinformatics is multidisciplinary in nature – it can be considered a service, a collection of tools and/or methods and a field of study in its own right. And it has become integral to life sciences, complimenting the work of the wet lab. Having  studied the bioinformatics community, and the work bioinformaticians perform, Bartlett and colleagues discuss whether bioinformatics is now a victim of “black boxing” – that it has become so successful that the focus has switched from the process itself, for example the creation of an algorithm or software,  to only the results of that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a mostly impressive ability to identify people we know based on the sound of their voice, but prior research has uncovered an intriguing exception – we’re not very good at discerning identity from laughter. Now Nadine Lavan and her colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513817301319&quot;&gt;published research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Evolution and Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt; that looks into why this might be and what it says about our evolutionary past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33086&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons why laughter may be hard to read. It might be because when you laugh for real, your vocal apparatus and lungs act in an involuntary way, unlike in many other vocalisations, and this difference in production might block the identity cues normally found in the voice. Alternatively, listeners of genuine laughter might get distracted by it’s contagious emotional content, meaning they don’t pick up on the identity cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test these possibilities, Lavan’s team recruited helpers to produce fake laughs (while trying to sound natural) and genuine laughs, provoked by playing them amusing sound and video clips. A team of judges then listened back and rated all the laughs as highly authentic sounding genuine laughs, unauthentic sounding fake ones, and also genuine and fake laughs that sounded somewhat authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers categorised the laughs this way is because genuine laughs can sometimes sound flat, whereas a forced laugh can sound remarkably authentic (as you’d know if you’ve ever been around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_yoga&quot;&gt;laughter yoga&lt;/a&gt; – or participated, as I did this month, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-smoke.org/2018-programme/the-best-medicine/&quot;&gt;a live-action game session&lt;/a&gt; where you could use gestures to command people to laugh at anything you said).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, 37 participants, around 24 years old, completed hundreds of trials, in which they listened to two of the recorded laughs, each a few seconds long, and had to decide whether they came from the same individual or not. As in prior research, the participants’ accuracy was poorest when judging the identity of two spontaneous laughs, rather than deliberate laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about authentic sounding fake laughs? If fact, participants were just as good at discerning identity from authentic sounding fake laughs as from non-authentic sounding fake laughs (and the degree to which spontaneous laughs appeared authentic also made no difference to performance). It was only the fact of being spontaneously produced that made laughs harder to identify, which suggests the difficulty reading identity isn’t due to listeners getting distracted, but by the fact the sounds are squeezed out in an involuntary way that is so different from human intentional speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings fit with an evolutionary account that is speculative but intriguing. It goes like this: animal vocalisations evolved primarily to signal information about threats or food, not identity, and even today our evolutionarily old, spontaneous vocalisations, including laughter, remain as personally undifferentiated as those of animals (which would explain why can’t distinguish slowed-down spontaneous laughter from slowed-down animal calls). However, as humans became increasingly comfortable with making voluntary sounds through developing speech, we began to lean towards peppering those sounds with elements that are distinctive. In ever-larger social groups, it became important for us to signal identity, a prerequisite for developing trust and reciprocity over time. According to this story, the distinctive voice is a hallmark of our species that we acquired on the road to becoming savvy social beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513817301319&quot;&gt;Impoverished encoding of speaker identity in spontaneous laughter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;A cortex by any other name&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*q5dqA14b5EAhZlfAZm7KzQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do love naming things. Nouns are the first words we learn: mummy; daddy. Or if you’re my kids: “digger” and “Bob” (the cat) — because who needs parents when there’s a big ginger cat to play with? That love for tagging an object with a label never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are no different. In large brains, like ours or rats or ferrets, we give hundreds of names to their constituent parts. Some name vast swathes of brain tissue: cortex, brainstem, midbrain. Some name tiny subdivisions of those swathes, like the almond shaped subthalamic nucleus (literally, the cluster of neurons underneath the thalamus). In tiny brains, like maggots or roundworms, even individual neurons have names. (Boring ones like “P4”; sadly, there is no neuron in &lt;em&gt;C Elegans&lt;/em&gt; called Boris).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By naming these bits of brain, we can communicate effectively, we can talk about brains and know we are talking about the same bit. We can navigate where we are in the brain by knowing the names of the brain regions. We can even identify ourselves by the bit of brain we study: “I work on cortex”; “I work on hippocampus”; “I couldn’t decide what I wanted to do when I left school; now I work on the nucleus ambiguus”. Naming bits of brain greases the wheels of scientific communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also a dangerous game. If we confuse the convenience of naming with the reality of the brain, we end up in deep trouble. Because evolution does not give a crap what we call a brain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger is that naming a bit of brain makes us think it is a discrete thing, a bit that just lifts right out, which we can study and marvel at in isolation. But how evolution (and development) conspire to disperse and wire together neurons pays no attention to these names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider primary motor and somatosensory cortex. They sit next to each other. But they appear in different chapters in textbooks. Entirely separate fields of research have grown up around them. Work on primary somatosensory cortex looks at how the activity of its neurons represent touch. Work on motor cortex looks how the activity of its neurons represent movement. These are starkly different: work on somatosensory cortex focuses on its inputs; work on motor cortex focuses on its outputs. They are treated so separately that papers merely showing the flow of activity from one to the other end up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/80903/&quot;&gt;in high-profile journals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these bits of cortex are next to each other. Either we believe that there are border guards who turn away the motor cortex neuron axons at the crossing with somatosensory cortex, and the same from the other direction. Or we have to assume that these two names loosely delineate a continuous network of neurons by the fact that a small set of neurons in somatosensory cortex get direct sensory input, and small set of neurons in motor cortex connect to the spinal cord. Most of the neurons in these bits of cortex neither get sensory input from the thalamus nor project to the spinal cord. They are wired to other neurons all over cortex, and very much to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at this nutter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZK8WIcZ8-EMeYtr1AphZbg.png&quot; /&gt;The projections of the axon of a single neuron in rodent motor cortex. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.85&quot;&gt;Zeng &amp;amp; Hanes 2017&lt;/a&gt; (Nature Neurosci Reviews)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution has deemed it necessary for this neuron in motor cortex to send its output wires, its axons, all over the shop. To the somatosensory cortex. To prefrontal cortex, so that the apparent seat of “executive function” — cogitating, planning, turning things over in your mind — apparently needs to know what your foot will be doing shortly. To the ectorhinal cortex (no, me neither). All over the striatum. And to the other side of the brain — yes, the brain has two sides. We call it a motor cortex neuron; it is studied for how it represents simple movements; but it is not a neuron that sits neatly tucked up in one neatly labelled part of the brain — it is part of the the brain’s sprawling, tangled network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortex is divided up into many different areas. Old schemes for dividing up the areas just used numbering. These numbers have been handed down to us from epic studies by unfathomably dedicated neuroanatomists in the early twentieth century. They finely sliced up brains, stained the slices to pick out the neurons, and then minutely examined the changes in the density, size, and shape of neurons across the brains. Each place where there was a change in one of those things got a number. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The temptation is to then think that these subtle differences in neurons correspond to different functions. We followed that temptation by turning many of those numbers into names: primary motor cortex; secondary motor cortex; primary somatosensory cortex; visual cortex. But in the human cortex Brodmann found 52 areas. von Economo and Koskinas found 107. Hmmm. One may reasonably ask: if just dividing up the cortex by changes in the shape, size, or density of neurons actually tells us something about what the different areas do, how come the numbers of areas were so different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18933&quot;&gt;massive fMRI study&lt;/a&gt; used a bunch of ways to isolate different parts of cortex, and ended up with 180 different regions. Far more then the slice-and-stain guys. Which is right? None of them. Those lovely differences in cells are immaterial to actual function. Any given function we care to name — seeing, jumping, talking, putting our DVDs in thematic order because we’re not culturally illiterate barbarians — engages many areas of cortex, and many areas of the brain, at the same time. The names and numbers are misleading, are irrelevant to how evolution has driven the wiring of the brain to perform a function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortex has names for its layers too. Names straight out of a Dan Brown novel: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and — wait for it — 6. In rodents, some areas have six layers, and some have five because they are missing layer 4. And as the textbooks will tell you, it stands to reason that motor cortex and somatosensory cortex have different functions because motor cortex doesn’t have a layer 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an object lesson in the problems of naming: we could not name a clear cell “layer 4” in motor cortex, because we couldn’t see one. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05422&quot;&gt;there is one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/9/2435&quot;&gt;it’s&lt;/a&gt; been there all along. What would you bet me that it will turn out the rat prefrontal cortex does have a “layer 4” after all — a set of neurons that are specifically targeted by input from thalamus and then connect to other neurons in the cortex without projecting outwards — just not in a distinct layer we can see by colouring in neurons? Evolution doesn’t care that we can name five layers in one region, or six in another. In only cares what they do to keep the animal alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evolution, the brain is just a gigantic bag of cells, wired together. The purpose of that gigantic bag of cells is to contribute to the survival of the organism in which it resides, to surviving long enough to reproduce. Those that reproduce, win; those that don’t, don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a random mutation causes or changes the wiring of some neurons to another group of neurons, and that mutation improves the chances of having offspring, it will likely spread through the population. If that random mutation adds connections from prefrontal cortex to visual cortex; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.024&quot;&gt;cortical interneurons to a structure outside cortex&lt;/a&gt;; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3-rPFu-7YAhVRSsAKHc88AqkQFgg0MAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fneuron%2Fabstract%2FS0896-6273%252812%252900281-4&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2p6o-v_lthY7HSWHGFWdUe&quot;&gt;motor cortex to midbrain dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt;, then it will happen. Evolution will not feel sorry that it’s just ruined another set of textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is just a giant bag of cells wired together. Our best evidence that it is not — that we can cling to our names of all the bits — come from studies where we cut a bit out or turn a bit off. When we cut out area X and we see a “deficit” in behaviour Y of an animal (like tying its shoelaces), then we think “aha! Area X is for tying shoelaces”. No. For starters, we never see a complete and permanent end to behaviour Y. We normally see that the animal is simply worse at doing or learning Y — not that it cannot do Y at all. The brain can carry on doing Y just fine, thanks, just not as well — there is massive redundancy in the brain. Like what you’d find if it was a giant bag of cells, wired together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, seeing that behaviour Y gets worse logically tells us little about what area X is actually doing. It just tells us that damaging area X causes problems. Which on reflection isn’t surprising as you just ripped a chunk out of the brain. The logical fallacy is simple to demonstrate. I am right now going to make a new startling new prediction of how the mouse brain works: the ventrolateral medulla is necessary for mice to learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food. Cut out the ventrolateral medulla, and a mouse will not learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it will be dead. The ventrolateral medulla contains the neurons which control the rhythm of breathing. Cut it out: no breathing. Ergo, no learning. Is the ventrolateral medulla a crucial brain area for learning? No. But by damaging it, we damage something vital to the process of learning. Thus, cutting a bit that we’ve given a name can have an effect on that named thing, and we learn nothing at all. Except that we have damaged a big bag of cells, wired together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more remarkable is when cutting bits out has &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; effect. If we cut some bits of brain out before learning we see an effect — learning is made slower or worse or both; but when we cut them out after learning, it has no apparent effect whatsoever. These bits of brain have become completely redundant. Again: giant bag of cells, wired together — there are many ways within that bag of cells to solve the problem at hand, enough for the brain to just stop using a bit of itself altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people get hyper-excited about finding odd signals where they were utterly unexpected. Like finding that reward changes activity in primary visual cortex. Or finding that sound is encoded in the hippocampus. These are great, interesting studies. But to be surprised by them is to fall into the naming fallacy. Evolution does not know nor care that we called this chunk of neurons the “hippocampus”. It is just another bag of neurons, connected to many other bags of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names. Names are vital. Names mean we can all be sure we’re talking about the same thing. They identify whopping great phalanxes of neural tissue; they identify individual neurons; they let us compare brains of different creatures. But we have to handle them with care, less we confuse the label with the contents. Evolution only cares about the contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And development doesn’t give a damn what we call a brain region either. But that’s a tale for another time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=1c9c5f80ab89&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/evolution-doesnt-give-a-damn-what-you-think-a-brain-region-is-called-1c9c5f80ab89&quot;&gt;Evolution doesn’t give a damn what you think a brain region is called&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Early in 2018, the default reaction to encountering someone who disagrees with you is to place your fingers in your ears. The US government went into shut down following an impasse in Congress. Meanwhile, the UK remains bitterly divided over Brexit. We could all benefit from a dose of intellectual humility, according to the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt;. People with this trait are open to other viewpoints and see disagreement as an opportunity to learn. Promisingly, early findings suggest that it may be possible to foster intellectual humility relatively easily, as least over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33080&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenelle Porter and Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh created a new intellectual humility questionnaire that asks participants to rate their agreement with 9 items like “I am willing to admit if I don’t know something”. The questionnaire is based on their conception of intellectual humility as recognising your own fallibility and the value and intellectual competence of others. Find the full list of items below (the letter R at the end of a statement means that greater agreement is a sign of &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; humility):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, nearly 200 students completed this questionnaire, as well as other personality measures, and then they were asked to imagine various scenarios at college that involved a classmate disagreeing with them, for example over the causes of World War I in history class, or a passage of text in English class. Finally, the students stated what they would think of the person who disagreed with them and how they would respond. A second study was similar, but this time nearly 200 more participants, recruited online, imagined a disagreement with another person over more hot-button issues, such as gun control and same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, even after accounting for the influence of many other factors such as a person’s self-esteem, narcissism, and overall agreeableness, openness and humility, the students who scored higher on intellectual humility tended to think about the person who disagreed with them in more constructive ways – for instance, believing the other person has their own unique perspective and experiences to draw on – rather than dismissing their views as due to low intelligence or lack of understanding. Moreover, those participants with greater intellectual humility were more likely to say that, given the chance, they would try to learn more about the other person’s views, rather than simply argue with them or try to change their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to how much we can read into participants’ responses to hypothetical scenarios. To test actual behaviour, Porter and Schumann turned to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website and asked nearly 200 people to complete the intellectual humility questionnaire before revealing their position on gun control or capital punishment. Next, the participants had the chance to read opinions (written by the researchers but made to look like the opinions of other survey participants) that either agreed with their stance or took the opposite view. The researchers counted the in-survey links the participants chose to click on to read the different views. Higher scorers in intellectual humility held views that were just as strong as those low in intellectual humility, but they spent a greater proportion of time reading views that were opposed to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if we all had a little more intellectual humility? The researchers tested an intervention that they hoped would increase intellectual humility via the promotion of a “growth mindset” – that is, belief in the malleability of intelligence. It makes sense that if you see intelligence as malleable, then you will be less worried about finding out you are wrong or that you don’t know the full story. After all, with this perspective, just because you are wrong or ignorant about something doesn’t mean you are forever condemned to being stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study showed that participants who read a popular magazine article about the malleability of intelligence (designed to foster a “growth mindset”) subsequently scored higher on intellectual humility than another group who read an article about intelligence being fixed. What’s more, those in the growth mindset condition went on to display a more positive approach when imagining dealing with someone with opposing views, and this seemed to be driven by their increased intellectual humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world in which we seem to find it harder than ever to listen to the other side, this research is welcome. On the other hand, it’s sure to attract accusations of demonstrating the obvious. For their part, the researchers claim this is the first attempt to show there is a relation between intellectual humility and openness to opposing views. Another problem is the studies relied rather too much on hypothetical scenarios and all involved participants resident in the US. Hopefully, though, this paper will serve as a launch pad for future research that will overcome these shortcomings, and discover more about the roots of intellectual humility and how to nurture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Promoting intellectual humility may offer one path to making disagreements more constructive,” the researchers concluded, “and our research suggests that teaching people a malleable view of intelligence may be one promising way to foster intellectual humility and its associated benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Mathematics-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9590&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Mathematics-e1509098029578.jpg&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal journey to biostatistics has been quite unorthodox and convoluted; funnily, many colleagues around the world share my non-linear experience. After I received my degree in pharmacology, I spent some years in different post graduate courses, while working for a small pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story suddenly changed when I fell in love with clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK). After a training course at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, I got a Ph.D. dedicated to PK trials in oncology and then a post-doctoral position at University of Southern California, PK Lab in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very quickly realised that it would be impossible to manage complex PK studies without a good training in statistics; PK was more and more becoming a critical add-on to many oncology studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I qualified as a clinical epidemiologist/biostatistician, I found that the leap from PK models to biostatistics for oncology clinical trials was almost immediate. I could directly take part in the development of new chemotherapeutics regimens, even without the dependence on the facilities of a classical drug monitoring lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to share my ideas, interact with the study’s physicians and to support their inferences with my biostatistics models (or sometimes denying them too!) has been very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, I have been closely collaborating with oncologists, planning, performing and reporting more than a hundred human trials: hospital life has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life, not to mention its didactics value. The opportunity to share my ideas, interact with the study’s physicians and to support their inferences with my biostatistics models (or sometimes denying them too!) has been very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, I have been focusing on my editorial responsibilities, particularly with the &lt;em&gt;BMC-s&lt;/em&gt;eries journals. I have been given the opportunity to serve as Associate Editor in three different &lt;em&gt;BMC-&lt;/em&gt;series journals, &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes.&lt;/em&gt; I also serve as an Editorial Advisor for the &lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series. My collaboration with the &lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series has been highly rewarding, as I have been driven by two main motivations; my curiosity to continuously learn new and emerging topics from our international authorship and the opportunity to stay updated on established ones: both of them have been satisfied. Naturally, this has translated into a notable improvement in my research career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to be a very humble and open minded assessor, but the chances to be critical have not been lacking: new manuscripts in the field of cancer research show a widespread level of quality with regards to biostatistics. Why does this happen? There could be several different reasons. So here is some advice for potential authors on getting biostatistics right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for the support of statistical advisers not only before but even during the peer-review process, since it’s not always solicited by default from the single editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the minimum acceptable criteria for basic statistical reporting in biomedical journals, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sampl/&quot;&gt;SAMPL&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the minimum acceptable criteria for the standardization of clinical protocol items, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/spirit-2013-statement-defining-standard-protocol-items-for-clinical-trials/&quot;&gt;SPIRIT&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses might not meet the classical standards; in that case, you should properly consider the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/&quot;&gt;PRISMA&lt;/a&gt; guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A formal sample size estimation is not always present in the manuscripts. Don’t forget that this information is critical for your reviewers and readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is a myriad of considerations and arguments that deserve to be covered. I look forward to working with the esteemed editorial and statistical advisory boards of &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; and I warmly encourage the respectable reader to share their ideas or insights on the intersection of biostatistics with the field of cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/22/self-control-and-cognitive-control-are-not-the-same-thing/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s common for psychologists to use the terms “self-control” and “cognitive control” interchangeably. Consider the introduction to a review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661313002945&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt; on whether our &lt;em&gt;self-control&lt;/em&gt; is limited or not (I’ve added the emphases): “Whereas &lt;em&gt;cognitive control&lt;/em&gt; relies on at least three separate (yet related) executive functions – task switching, working-memory, and inhibition – at its heart, &lt;em&gt;self-control&lt;/em&gt; is most clearly related to inhibitory &lt;em&gt;cognitive control&lt;/em&gt; …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scholars do make a distinction, they mostly use self-control to refer to the ability to delay immediate gratification in the service of a longer-term goal, whereas they use the term cognitive control to refer to the related ability to ignore distracting information or stimuli. Defined this way, do self-control and cognitive control essentially involve the same mental processes? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691816303870#bb0115&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by Stefan Scherbaum at Technische Universität Dresden and his colleagues in &lt;em&gt;Acta Psychologica&lt;/em&gt;, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33047&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight student participants completed alternating trials of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_effect&quot;&gt;Simon Test&lt;/a&gt; and “inter-temporal” decision making (i.e. deciding between immediate or more distant rewards). This was a mash up of a well-established cognitive control test and an established self-control test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Simon task, which taps cognitive control, required the participants to indicate as fast as possible the direction of an on-screen arrow, while ignoring the arrow’s screen location. On incongruent trials where the arrow’s direction and screen location are in opposition (e.g. a left-ward pointing arrow on the right side of the screen), it takes cognitive control to perform well at the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the inter-temporal decisions, the students had to choose between smaller cash rewards now or larger cash rewards later (they were asked to pretend these were real decisions). It takes self-control to resist smaller immediate rewards for longer-term larger gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical phenomenon that occurs during the Simon Task is that while people are generally slower on incongruent trials, completing one incongruent trial leads to improved performance on a subsequent incongruent trial, as if one’s powers of cognitive control have been activated or engaged. Scherbaum and his colleagues’ ingenious idea was to see if this effect would spill over into the decision making trials. Would participants, after having their cognitive control activated by an incongruent Simon Task trial, show more self-control when making a financial decision immediately afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cognitive control and self-control essentially involve the same cognitive processes, then the researchers should have found this spill-over effect between the two types of trial, but in fact there was no evidence for this in the results, not a hint of it. In a further analysis the researchers also couldn’t see any evidence of self-control processes, as measured by participants’ making more patient financial decisions, having any effect on their cognitive control, as measured by their subsequent Simon Task performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this study isn’t conclusive. It’s possible that different measures of cognitive control and self-control might in future uncover some overlap. However, what the new findings do suggest is that, at least to a degree, the two constructs depend on different mental processes that operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded: “While both cognitive control and self-control may be observed when we control and steer our behavior toward the pursuit of long-term goals, they may depend on different underlying processes such as the avoidance of distraction – in the case of cognitive control – or resisting short-term temptations – in the case of self-control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most contentious areas in psychology at present is the question of whether our willpower or self-control is a limited resource or not, as proposed by the theory of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=ego-depletion&quot;&gt;ego-depletion&lt;/a&gt;“. This new paper may lead us to wonder whether confusion around the related concepts of self-control and cognitive control has contributed to disagreements and inconsistencies in the research into ego-depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A greater understanding of the different mental processes that contribute to self-control and cognitive control might also contribute to better designed interventions for improving people’s focus, goal-planning and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691816303870#bb0130&quot;&gt;No evidence for common processes of cognitive control and self-control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Conferences on psychedelics are popping up everywhere, like mushrooms!” said Jakobien van der Weijden, of the Psychedelic Society of the Netherlands, when I met her in Amsterdam last week. Indeed, research into the use of psychedelic (mind-altering) drugs as tools in the treatment of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and end-of-life angst, is on the increase. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, may help to alleviate symptoms of depression by altering brain activity in key areas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-1-2018-14-13-41&quot;&gt;involved in emotional processing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/i&gt;, led by Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins University, has found that for mentally and physically healthy volunteers, two doses of psilocybin in conjunction with a programme of meditation and other “spiritual” practices was enough to bring about lasting, positive changes to traits including altruism, gratitude, forgiveness and feeling close to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 75 healthy adults, with an average age of 42, from the general population, and allocated them at random to one of three groups. The first group enrolled in “standard-level” support for spiritual practice, which consisted of a meditation book plus five hours meditation and spiritual training with an experienced “guide”. These participants then took two very low doses of psilocybin (just 1mg per 70kg – intended to act as a placebo), spaced one month apart, with each dose followed by a discussion of the experience with their spiritual guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of participants had the same level of spiritual practice support, but they were given higher doses of psilocybin – 20 mg/70kg for the first dose, and 30mg/70kg for the second (both fit into the range of dosages likely from recreational use of magic mushrooms.). Earlier studies have shown that psilocybin has various effects on the brain. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7&quot;&gt;reduces blood flow in the amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in emotional responses, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third group took the higher doses of psilocybin but also had far more extensive support and face-to-face time with their guides, and this continued for four months after their second dose of psilocybin. This included taking part in twice-monthly, 90-minute group dialogue sessions, in which they were encouraged to focus on discussing their successes and challenges in sustaining the regular spiritual practices of meditation, awareness and journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the participants nor the guides knew which psilocybin doses they had received. Six months after the start of the study, both of the high-dose groups showed large, statistically significant positive changes on measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning or purpose, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, and religious faith and coping, whereas the placebo group did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-dose, high-support group scored highest on all the scales. In some cases, such as life meaning and a rating of life “strivings” as being sacred or spiritual, they scored much higher. Unlike the high dose/standard support group, they also showed a big increase in trait forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, “Strikingly, more than half of participants in the high spiritual support condition rated their experience in one or both psilocybin sessions as the single most spiritually significant experience of their life, with 96 per cent rating it as among the top five most spiritually significant experiences.” In contrast, the percentages for the high-dose, standard support group were 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the differences in their perception of the sessions, and their rates of engagement with meditation and other spiritual practices, that explained why the high-support, high-dose group showed larger trait changes and more intense spiritual experiences than the modest-support high-dose group, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the people recruited for the study all responded to an advert for volunteers who were interested in “developing their spiritual lives by participating in a study of the combined effects of meditation and psilocybin”. It’s not clear, then, whether this kind of programme could help people who aren’t particularly interested in developing their spiritual lives. Since there was no low-dose, high-support group, it’s also hard to be sure how important psilocybin was to the observed effects – perhaps the intensive “spiritual practices” and support were the more critical ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work does suggest that further investigation of the effects of psilocybin may in theory lead to new interventions, not only to help people with a mental health disorder, but to create positive changes in attitudes and behaviour in healthy people. But there would have to be a change in the law. At the moment, in the UK, as in many other countries, psilocybin can only be consumed legally as part of an approved academic research programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other researchers involved in studies of psychedelic drugs have stressed that this work is still experimental, and have warned against self-medication. Magic mushrooms and closely-related psilocybin-containing truffles (which are legal in the Netherlands), contain varying levels of the drug, so it’s impossible to be sure of the dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;Psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience in combination with meditation and other spiritual practices produces enduring positive changes in psychological functioning and in trait measures of prosocial attitudes and behaviors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
