 &lt;p&gt;Suing the government is difficult. And because public universities often function as an arm of state governments, that makes them hard to sue, too, a fact reiterated in a whistleblower case decided earlier this year. In January, Judge David Hale of the Western District of Kentucky dismissed a lawsuit filed by former employees of the […]&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2017-07-07T14:00:27+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Zamenis_longissimus_Aesculapian_snake_user_cpratte_via-roadkill.at_-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide many terrestrial vertebrate populations are declining due to several reasons. Among them are habitat loss, climate change, illegal hunting and roads. The influences of roads on animal biodiversity are manifold, ranging from various pollutions to the most direct impact of road-kill. Our new research article focuses on the effects of land-cover on road-killed amphibians and reptiles and the feasibility of a large scale citizen science approach to elucidate underlying patterns and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen science is the active participation of laymen/amateurs in scientific projects. Currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/articles/10.5334/cstp.96/&quot;&gt;a discussion is going on&lt;/a&gt; regarding the terminology in citizen science. What is ‘citizen science’, who is a ‘citizen’ and who is allowed to do ‘science’. However, the participation of amateurs in scientific projects has many benefits, including the collection of data on different objects covering a wide geographic area, and at the same time it raises awareness for a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of our citizen science project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadkill.at/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadkill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to get an overview of numbers and patterns of road-killed vertebrates. In the last 3 years over 500 participants collected data of more than 5000 road-kills all over the world with a focus on Austria. The workload of the project is completely covered by volunteers (professional scientists and amateurs), ranging from website and app development to data collection, verification and publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9267&quot; style=&quot;width: 856px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9267&quot; height=&quot;843&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/European_green_toad_-user_JGZ_via_roadkill.at_.png&quot; width=&quot;846&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;European green toad killed on a road&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;User JGZ via roadkill.at&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2013 we regularly improved our method of data collection, published three peer reviewed articles, and did a lot of public relations in order to increase the number of project participants. Only then was it possible to cover the large and diverse geographic area of Austria and to increase data quantity. If you are interested in our work, please follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/project.roadkill&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProjektRoadkill&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/projectroadkill/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of our study was to examine the applicability of open-access remote sensing data for a large-scale citizen science approach to describe spatial patterns of road-killed amphibians and reptiles on tertiary roads. Using our citizen science app &lt;em&gt;Roadkill&lt;/em&gt; we monitored road-kills of amphibians and reptiles along 97.5 km of tertiary roads covering agricultural, municipal and interurban roads as well as cycling paths in eastern Austria over two seasons. Surrounding landscape was assessed using open access land cover classes for the region (Coordination of Information on the Environment, CORINE). We also estimated the potential cost-efficiency of a large scale citizen science monitoring project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recorded 180 amphibian and 72 reptile road-kills comprising eight species mainly occurring on agricultural roads. We found a significant clustering of road-killed amphibians and reptiles, which is important information for authorities aiming to mitigate road-kills. Our analyses identified road-kills especially next to preferred habitats of green toads, common toads, and grass snakes. It was encouraging to see that land cover classes based on a rather coarse 500-m grid matched well with the most preferred habitats of the most abundant amphibian species in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9268&quot; style=&quot;width: 857px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9268&quot; height=&quot;844&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Lacerta_viridis_European_green_lizard_user_JGZ_via-_roadkill.at_.png&quot; width=&quot;847&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Remains of a road-killed European green lizard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;User JGZ via roadkill.at&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We concluded that citizen science would be an appropriate method to monitor road-kills of amphibians and reptiles on a regular basis and on a larger scale when investigating the influence of land cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans for the future are to (I) continue the long-term citizen observatory system for road-killed vertebrates in Austria including the presence-only data collection and additionally establish a monitoring approach in coordination with already existing European systems, (II) enhance awareness-raising for the topic of road-killed animals among the general public and (III) develop a monitoring system involving various stakeholders aiming to reduce the number of road-killed animals in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, a select cohort of underrepresented minority STEM students will begin their path to leadership. Science Exchange will be represented with the participation of Dr. Gabriel Roybal-Jungemann, Senior Scientist, Research and Development Specialist, as a Career Panel Speaker for the &lt;strong&gt;inaugural SACNAS Chapter Leadership Institute (CLI).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI is led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sacnas.org/&quot;&gt;Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics &amp;amp; Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)&lt;/a&gt; and funded by the Genentech Foundation. Dr. Roybal-Jungemann has been involved with SACNAS since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institute, held July 7 – 8 at San Jose City College, is two full days of small group exercises, keynote speakers, leadership development workshops, networking opportunities, and extensive community building among selected participants from colleges and universities across California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SACNAS Director of Programs, Mr. Rolando Madrid says the Genentech Foundation is the ideal partner to nurture a new generation of leaders. He notes, “We are proud to partner with the Genentech Foundation to launch our inaugural Chapter Leadership Institute. Genentech understands the importance of investing in our next generation of underrepresented minority scientists and is doing their part to ensure that the future is well developed and prepared to tackle the issues of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants of the CLI are all part of the SACNAS chapter program, a national network of 115 student and professional chapters that work to strengthen community and peer support for minority scientists at the local and regional levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Tanya Beat, manager of the SACNAS Chapter Program, says, “The CLI will equip students with critical take-away tools including individual leadership plans, mentor-mentee relationships, and a rich network of peers and STEM leaders from California.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2009, SACNAS leadership initiatives have trained a cohort of 30 PhD-level scientists each year, making it the largest group of emerging STEM leaders of color in the country. With the introduction of CLI, SACNAS is expanding leadership training to the undergraduate and graduate student levels, nurturing leaders earlier in their educational and career trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Mischel’s Marshmallow Test of self-control is one of psychology’s iconic experimental set-ups. First conducted in the 1960s, Mischel told the kids he tested that if they managed to resist eating the marshmallow in front of them until he returned (usually about 15 minutes later), they would be rewarded with a second marshmallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children varied greatly in their powers of restraint and those who performed better displayed some cute distraction strategies, such as singing to themselves and covering their eyes. Perhaps most important, those kids who performed well at the test tended to do well in later life too, in terms of their health, education and career success. Given the huge impact this research has had, it’s amazing that it’s never been exported to a non-Western setting. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12847/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;, Bettina Lamm and her colleagues have compared the performance of 125 4-year-olds from urban middle-class Germany with the performance of dozens of 4-year-olds from the Nso farming families of rural Cameroon. The Cameroonian kids aced the test, performing much better than their German peers. What’s more, their success seemed to be tied to the traditional, strict, hierarchical culture in which they’d been raised. The results challenge Western assumptions about what constitutes an ideal parenting style, and they provide another powerful demonstration of the urgent need for psychology to conduct more research outside of its usual Western focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26323&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task faced by the German and Cameroonian children was very similar to the original version of the Marshmallow Test except the source of temptation for the German kids was either a lollipop or a chocolate bar (no one treat is equally liked in Germany so the researchers used whichever was the more desirable for each child), and for the Cameroonians it was a puff-puff, which is a kind of doughnut. On first seeing whichever treat was used, the children’s initial outward behavior in both cultures made it clear that they found it extremely tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children sat at a table on which either the lollipop, chocolate bar or puff-puff was placed within their reach. Before leaving the room, the researcher told them that they could eat the treat now, or if they waited until the researcher came back (which he or she did 10 minutes later), they would get the first treat plus a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70 per cent of the Cameroonian children succeeded in waiting for the researcher to return without eating the first treat, compared with fewer than 30 per cent of the German children. Furthermore, the emotions the children displayed and the strategies they used differed depending on their cultural background. Whereas the German children showed more frustration and used a lot of distraction techniques, such as turning away, talking and singing, the Cameroonians showed little emotion or activity, in fact eight of them fell asleep! Also several of the German kids who couldn’t wait actually left the room to go and look for the researcher, but only one Cameroonian kid did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the contrast in behavior between the children in the two cultures has to do with the very different social milieu and parenting styles they have experienced. The Cameroonian kids are raised in multi-generational family groups with many siblings and they are taught to contain their emotions, obey their elders and to recognise the importance of group solidarity and social responsibility. In contrast, and as in most rich Western countries, the German kids are mostly raised in small family groups and they are taught the importance of self-expression, individuality and freedom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamm and her team think this manifests in the way the kids from the two cultures handle the Marshmallow Test: the German kids sought to impose their will on the situation, such as by districting themselves or leaving the room to go look for the researcher. By contrast, the Cameroonian kids adopted what the researchers call “holistic self-regulation”, that is they seemed to be better able to control their own emotions from within, perhaps through all the practice they’d had in their upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is conjecture, of course. There are other ways to interpret the findings – for instance, we don’t know for sure that the Cameroonian kids really were as tempted by the treats as the Germans. Perhaps they found the whole set-up more intimidating and they were more subdued (though there was no evidence that they displayed more negative emotion). As the researchers admitted, “it remains unclear whether [the Cameroonian kids’ success] is the result of effective emotion regulation in this specific situation or whether emotional socialisation [their strict upbringing] produces a completely different experience of the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their theory that children’s self-control develops differently across the cultures due to different social values and parenting styles, Lamm and her colleagues performed a follow up study using data they’d collected from a sub-set of the kids in both cultures when they were just 9-month-old babies. This involved videoing the babies and their mothers in a free play session and coding the mothers’ behavior. The mothers also completed questionnaires about the social values they most cherished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the researchers found that the Cameroonian mothers placed more value on conservative goals (loyalty, obedience, solidarity etc) and they were more directive in their play, creating a highly structured play situation and continually engaging their infants. The German mothers said they valued encouraging psychological autonomy (freedom of preference, individuality etc) and in their play they were less hands on, tending to let their babies take the lead and letting them have more unstructured breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these distinctive parenting patterns correlated with the children’s Marshmallow test performance at age 4. Across groups, kids with mothers who particularly emphasized autononomy and freedom and allowed more unstructured play particularly struggled to resist the treat – this was mostly the German kids. In contrast, kids with mothers who particularly emphasized traditional hiercharchial goals and structured play tended to excel at showing self-restraint – this was mostly the Cameroonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are group-level correlations so causal effects of parenting and values have not been established (among other things, the genetic inheritance of self-control is an important confound). But one credible interpretation of the findings is that children’s self-control is shaped by the culture of their upbringing, and that there are different ways to find success in the Marshmallow test – the less effective “external” approach of the Western kids, which is based on exerting control over the environment, versus the more social, self-disciplined approach of the Cameroonian kids quite likely based on their having learnt greater control of their emotions in the service of obedience and group solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, this picture clashes somewhat with popular Western findings and theory around parenting, which stated crudely have suggested that authoritative parenting (in which children are given boundaries but are also supported and encouraged to pursue their own interests and desires) is the ideal way to foster a conscientious child whereas authoritarian parenting (strict and limiting parenting that emphasises obedience, arguably similar in some ways to the Cameroonian approach) should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating possibility is the developmental consequences of different parenting styles is culture-dependent: for instance, perhaps a more authoritarian style is beneficial to children raised in rural Cameroon in large families with many generations under one roof and strict social hierarchies. If nothing else, this research is a reminder that we must study a broader range of humanity else we might find our most cherished theories are built on foundations of Western sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0167-7&quot;&gt;Results-free review&lt;/a&gt; is a new model of peer review aiming to reduce publication bias, and prevent impressive ends from justifying poor means. &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt; first launched results-free review in December 2016, and the first article to have undergone the full results-free review process has been published and is featured below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2&quot;&gt;Consumption of wine and glass size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few studies have explored the psychology of what influences how much alcohol is consumed in a social setting, and this study focuses on what can be done to change drinking behaviors based solely on how the alcohol is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study tested the effects changing the size of the wine glass had on the drinking rate, sip number, and sip duration of wine in young women. The same amount of wine was provided in either a small or large wine glass, and participates’ behavior was observed. Surprisingly, it was found that larger cup size resulted in women drinking alcohol much slower, and with shorter sip durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the study, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/12/results-free-review-impressions-from-the-first-published-article/&quot;&gt;a Q&amp;amp;A from the authors and editors&lt;/a&gt; discussing what the new peer-review process means for authors, reviewers, editors and readers. To learn more about how the size of a drinking glass can influence alcohol consumption the authors of this study have written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/12/micro-drinking-behaviors-responsible-increased-wine-consumption-served-larger-glass/&quot;&gt;blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of life decisions have become an increasingly common medical choice among terminally ill and suffering patients.  In Belgium, the right to die extends beyond just the terminally ill, and includes patients suffering from psychiatric disorders and dementia.  This study analyzes the anonymous databases of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee Euthanasia from the implementation of the euthanasia law in Belgium in 2002 until the end of 2013, and found that the prevalence of euthanize has increased in this vulnerable population since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more in depth discussion on this topic, please read the&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/23/euthanasia-for-people-with-psychiatric-disorders-or-dementia/&quot;&gt; author blog&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ArticleTitle&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Microbiology:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-017-1044-0&quot;&gt;Gut microbial colonization and asthma development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ArticleTitle&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The authors of this study explored the effects of environmental exposure and asthma development in developing mice. In this study mice were kept in a controlled, germ-free environment at various stages of development to investigate the effect of early-life diverse microbial exposures on gut microbial colonization in an OVA-induced asthma model in BALB/c mice.  The researchers found that exposure to the non-germ free environment lead to the greatest diversity in intestinal flora in the mice, and mice with increased intestinal flora diversity had lower pathological scores of OVA-induced asthma.  The results also suggest that exposure in early life to a diversity of the intestinal flora may prevent airway inflammation in asthma by regulating the Th1/Th2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ArticleTitle&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This study seeks to quantify if older adults can increase their daily activity by owning a pet dog. This longitudinal case-controlled study explores if owning a dog can lead to changes in exercise and behavior amount elderly adults in the UK.  Researchers compared a dog-owning population to a non-dog owning populations, of groups comprised of adults over the age of 65, and measured time spent walking, steps taken, and sedentary time. Results showed that owning a dog did lead to significant changes of behavior, specifically increased walking times, and increased step numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ArticleTitle&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;It is well known that drinking soda in excess can lead to severe health problems, namely obesity and diabetes.  This study explored the relationship between a diet with drinks containing high levels of high fructose corn syrup and likelihood to develop coronary heart disease in adults in the United States.  The researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between the years 2003–2006, and discovered a significant correlation between intake of any combination of HFCS sweetened soft drinks, fruit drinks, and apple juice with CHD.  The correlation may be due to the high ratio of fructose to glucose in these highly sweetened beverages, and a possible mechanism of action would be an underlying inability to absorb fructose contributing to the intestinal in situ formation of pro-inflammatory enFruAGEs, that are eventually absorbed and induce inflammation of the coronary arteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ArticleTitle&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Monitoring the health of in vitro spheroids is a difficult to asses, due to the physical nature of spheroids. In this methods paper the authors have constructed a monitoring system in which cytotoxicity in the same 3D spheroids was continuously and sensitively monitored over a long term using a non-destructive bioluminescence derived from Emerald Luc (ELuc), a green-emitting beetle luciferase from &lt;em class=&quot;EmphasisTypeItalic&quot;&gt;P. termitilluminans&lt;/em&gt;. This system can be applied to other cell models, such as human primary cells or stem cells, and is expected to serve as the preferred platform for simple and cost-effective long-term monitoring of cellular events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron oxide nanoparticles studies have been ongoing in several fields of medical research, most of which target the central nervous system.  These nanoparticles have a wide variety of uses, including to deliver medication, clarify MRI images, and target amyloid beta plaques.  The authors of this study performed a systematic review of the toxic effects of iron oxide nanoparticles, and the results suggest that depending on the type of nano-particles involved, their use can lead to iron accumulation, oxidative stress and protein aggregation in the neural cells.  Awareness of these results would be important for scientists performing future studies with iron oxide nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;

 A strange new paper reports &quot;abnormal&quot; brain activity in 10 patients with electrohypersensitivity (EHS) - a controversial condition allegedly triggered by electromagnetic fields from devices such as phones and power-lines.



But the methods used in this study were very odd.

According to the authors, Gunnar Heuser and Sylvia A. Heuser, the ten patients all suffered from symptoms such as

 &lt;p&gt;Are there a limited number of ways to describe the the background and methods of an experiment? Once something has been written well, and vetted by editors, is it a waste of time to rewrite it ? And if text has been reused, how should that be indicated — if at all? These are questions […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we screw up the good impressions we mean to make? In the extensive scientific literature on self-presentation, the most popular theory is that failures are due to a loss of control. We snap at someone, allow our voice to falter, or let our unlikeable side slip out from underneath the managed veneer. According to this theory, we know how we should behave, and only fall short because we’re distracted or drained of self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spc3.12321/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&lt;/i&gt; argues that people often make bad impressions, not because of a lack of self-control, but because they adopt counterproductive presentational tactics. Utrecht University’s Janina Steinmetz and her colleagues unpack several such tactics that many of us believe to be likely to impress but which psychology research shows are big mistakes. Their paper makes for a handy guide on how not to come across as a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26290&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, hold back from &lt;i&gt;back-handed compliments&lt;/i&gt;. Telling someone “you are very smart for an intern” might seem a clever manoeuvre to ensure admiration: encouraging the other person to like you, while reminding them of their place in the hierarchy. But it rarely pans out this way, as we’re quick to see these compliments for what they are: put-downs. What’s more, their calculated nature can betray how much you care about where you are ranked – which comes across as needy and actually lowers your status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, quit the &lt;i&gt;humblebragging&lt;/i&gt;. Though a newly coined word, the meaning should be familiar to most of us: an attempt at self-promotion cloaked in humility. Whether tweeted at you or brayed at you over a glass of wine, statements like “Paris, Milan AND Tel Aviv in four days? I must figure out how to pace myself…” typically come across as insincere, with a strong sense of manipulation to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinmetz’ team also discuss &lt;i&gt;hypocrisy, &lt;/i&gt;which admittedly is more an outcome than a tactic. But some people are more willing to skirt into this area, denouncing behaviours or attitudes when they think it will score them points, regardless of whether they’re just as guilty. Sometimes this is going to pay off, but being caught out as a hypocrite is going to have a far greater negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, avoid &lt;i&gt;hubris.&lt;/i&gt; Research shows that we really don’t like people who big themselves up in comparison to other people. “I’m better than others at X” is more poorly received than “I’m good at” or “I’m better at X than I was”. Such downward social comparisons are seen as hostile, and even if they aren’t directed negatively at the audience, the audience tends to read it as an indirect poke at their own ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that in a social media-focused world where people benefit from seeming larger than life, these tactics can provide benefits of a sort, through creating a divisive but memorable persona. Certainly, many contemporary media figures trade on self-promotion and a blow-hard demeanor, and arguably Donald Trump propelled himself to the White House by drawing on these methods. But the evidence base suggests that the impact of these behaviours on our personal relationships, in real, everyday interactions, is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasise that there are other, well-documented ways of making a bad impression, such as extreme shyness making it hard to engage. But what’s interesting about the four self-sabotaging tactics they’ve identified is that a lot of us choose them freely – especially when we fail to think how something might look from the other person’s point of view – and hence we should be able to address them at source. After all, sharing an event that makes you proud (but also has an embarrassing aspect) may be received as a humblebrag, or as a fun anecdote, depending on the conversational context and the receiver’s state of mind. The good news here is that perspective-taking is something that we can all practice and become more mindful about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know someone who is habitually prone to the bad tactics highlighted here, it’s possible they score higher than average in trait narcissism. Such individuals usually enjoy making downward comparisons, back-handed compliments, and hubristic statements – seeing such tactics as a way to keep others in their place in order to protect their own high status. They also tend towards manipulation, using tactics to manipulate others. They typically take risks, which makes them liable to humblebrag and act hypocritically and assume that these tricks won’t be caught. Finally, they rarely go in for perspective-taking, which further compounds their predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a narcissist or not, it’s best to cut out these tactics sooner rather than later, because they may produce a vicious cycle. If you use them, people tend not to want to be close to you – but it’s precisely those closest to you that may give you honest feedback, like “that feels like humblebragging”. After shedding close friends, you could end up with a circle of acquaintances happy enough to nod along in public… and roll their eyes when your back is turned. Perhaps, then, the worst impression is the one you don’t even know you are making.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Sequencing the genomes of every individual kākāpō in the entire species&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kakapo bird&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1095 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Kakapo-final-300x193.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kākāpō is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family Strigopoidea endemic to New Zealand. With only 154 living individuals remaining, it’s one of the world’s rarest birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geneticrescue.science&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Genetic Rescue Foundation&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1096 &quot; height=&quot;75&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/genetic-rescue-logo-a550e39dc25e0d839fc6df0653bdfa2e.png&quot; width=&quot;439&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since early 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geneticrescue.science&quot;&gt;The Genetic Rescue Foundation,&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with The Department of Conservation (DOC), The University of Otago, Duke University, New Zealand Genomics Ltd (NZGL), Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, and Science Exchange, has funded and managed the effort to sequence the genomes of every individual in this quirky, critically endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.geneticrescue.science&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DNA Portraits&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/portraits.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genetic Rescue Foundation’s fundraising has come in the form of generous private donations, kākāpō &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.geneticrescue.science&quot;&gt;DNA portrait sales&lt;/a&gt; and a successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.experiment.com/kakapo&quot;&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; on Experiment.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the project has successfully sequenced 80 kākāpō. Part of the work was made possible by collaborating with DNA sequencing service providers on the Science Exchange network of 2,500+ service providers. Today we’re thrilled to announce that Science Exchange will be funding the remainder of the project in order to bring it to completion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kinghorn-centre-for-clinical-genomics&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kinghorn Centre and Garvan Institute Logos&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1098&quot; height=&quot;189&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kinghorn-garvan-logos--1024x402.png&quot; width=&quot;482&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining sequencing will be performed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kinghorn-centre-for-clinical-genomics&quot;&gt;The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/garvan-institute-of-medical-research&quot;&gt;The Garvan Institute of Medical Research&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney, Australia. The Kinghorn Centre is a frequently used provider of DNA sequencing services on the Science Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed genetic data for every individual in an entire species is a world first and represents a genomics-focused paradigm shift in modern conservation efforts. The possible discoveries that will come from this rich dataset are limitless. Scientists’ immediate efforts will be focused on finding genetic links to dwarfism, infertility and other diseases and conditions hampering kākāpō population recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset will be controlled by the New Zealand government but will be made available for all non-profit researchers to use. All sequencing will be completed by the end of 2017, with the full dataset available for researchers in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Science Exchange has made completing this project possible. They’ve achieved that by providing The Genetic Rescue Foundation with unrivaled access to the world’s best scientific service providers and by stepping in to fund the remainder of the project. This data will steer kākāpō conservation decisions for years and decades to come. It may prove to be the deciding factor in saving this species.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are retro-translocated through the membrane into the cytosol, where they are poly-ubiquitinated, extracted from the ER membrane, and degraded by the proteasome1–4, a pathway termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Proteins with misfolded domains in the ER lumen or membrane are discarded through the ERAD-L and -M pathways, respectively. In S. cerevisiae, both pathways require the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a multi-spanning membrane protein with a cytosolic RING finger domain5,6. Hrd1 is the crucial membrane component for retro-translocation7,8, but whether it forms a protein-conducting channel is unclear. Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of S. cerevisiae Hrd1 in complex with its ER luminal binding partner Hrd3. Hrd1 forms a dimer within the membrane with one or two Hrd3 molecules associated at its luminal side. Each Hrd1 molecule has eight trans-membrane segments, five of which form an aqueous cavity extending from the cytosol almost to the ER lumen, while a segment of the neighboring Hrd1 molecule forms a lateral seal. The aqueous cavity and lateral gate are reminiscent of features in protein-conducting conduits that facilitate polypeptide movement in the opposite direction, that is, from the cytosol into or across membranes9–11. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a retro-translocation channel for the movement of misfolded polypeptides through the ER membrane.

 &lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over 20% of children will experience some problems with learning during their schooling that can have a negative impact on their academic attainment, wellbeing, and longer-term prospects. Traditionally difficulties are grouped in diagnostic categories like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, or conduct disorder. Each diagnostic category is associated with certain behaviours that need to be present for the label to be applied. However, children’s difficulties often span multiple domains. For instance, a child could have difficulties with paying attention in the classroom (ADHD) and could also have a deficit in reading (dyslexia). This makes it difficult to decide which diagnostic label is the most appropriate and, consequently, what support to provide. Further, there can be a mixture of difficulties within a diagnostic category. For instance, children with ADHD can have mostly deficits with inattention or hyperactivity, or both. This heterogeneity makes research on the mechanisms behind these disorders very difficult as each subtype may be associated with specific mechanisms. However, there is currently no agreement about the presence, number, or nature of subtypes in most developmental disorders.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our latest study, we applied a new approach to group behavioural difficulties in a large sample of children who attended the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory (CALM). This sample is a mixed group of children who were referred because of any difficulty relating to attention, learning, and/or memory. The parents of the children filled in a questionnaire that is often part of the assessment that informs the advice of education specialists on the most appropriate support for a child. The questionnaire contained questions like “Forgets to turn in completed work”, “Does not understand what he/she reads”, or “Does not get invited to play or go out with others”. In our analysis, we grouped children by the similarity of ratings on this questionnaire using a data-driven algorithm. The algorithm had two aims: a) form groups that are maximally different b) groups should contain cases that are as similar as possible. The results suggested that there were three groups of children with: 1) primary difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and self-management 2) primary difficulties with school learning, e.g. reading and maths deficits 3) primary difficulties with making and maintaining friendships.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, we investigated if the behavioural profiles identified through the algorithm also show differences in brain anatomy. We found that white matter connections of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex mostly strongly distinguished the groups. These areas are implicated in cognitive control, decision making, and behavioural regulation. This indicates that the data-driven grouping aligns well with biological differences that we can investigate in more detail in future studies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The preprint of the study can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/158949&quot;&gt;http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/158949&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Human Brain Project (HBP) is a 10-year &quot;flagship research initiative&quot; funded
by the EU. Last September, the University of Hertfordshire has joined this
initiative as one of over 120 international partners. The goal of HBP is to
&quot;accelerate the fields of neuroscience, computing and brain-related medicine&quot;
[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my presentation I will give an overview on the science that is done in HBP,
with a special focus on our specific role within this huge project.  The HBP
provides 6 &quot;research platforms&quot; that are potentially highly relevant to ongoing
projects in the Biocomputation group. I will introduce two of those platforms in
more detail, i.e. the neuromorphic computing platform and the neurorobotics
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/05/mental-health-drug-approval-and-biomedical-research-in-the-21st-century/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22561</id>
		<updated>2017-07-05T15:00:58+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A few weeks before the end of 2016, which was also a few weeks before the end of a congressional session and the end of President Barack Obama’s time in office, the 21st Century Cures Act became law. It had been passed with overwhelming support in the House of Representatives and the Senate and it was signed in to law by President Obama in December. The law makes sweeping, if not controversial, changes to many of the most important issues facing health care today, but we must wait to see how – and if – the law will be funded under a new President and future Congresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally introduced in 2015, the Act was proposed with the goal of promoting development and speeding approval of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;new drugs&lt;/a&gt; and medical devices, and, in its final form, it offers broad incentives and funding opportunities for many areas of health care research, development, and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law directs increasing the budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and creating an NIH fund to promote innovation in research and support opportunities for young researchers. NIH-funded research plays a crucial role in supporting the approval of many new drugs, so this is a welcome addition for many drug developers and researchers. The bill also commits billions of dollars to research precision medicine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/05/a-virtual-brain-the-benefits-of-brain-modelling/&quot;&gt;map the human brain&lt;/a&gt;, and cure cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of the Act is devoted to accelerating the drug approval process. The U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/04/15/fda-supports-compounding-of-off-label-drug-to-prevent-preterm-labor/&quot;&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;—the gatekeeper of all drugs and devices in the United States—is now instructed by the Act to consider nontraditional study designs and methods when evaluating approvals of new drugs and indications. While most people, especially those in the health care industry, view the approval of new safe and effective drugs as a laudable goal, the willingness to rely on shorter or smaller clinical trials or observational studies or registries to evaluate safety and effectiveness may prove to be problematic. Such approaches are not as rigorous as randomized, controlled trials, that have been, until now, the gold standard of drug approval data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act also encourages the FDA to rely on biomarkers instead of clinical outcomes to assess effectiveness. However, biomarkers are not always accurate representations or predictors of disease risks and endpoints. The Act does not change FDA approval standards, but it allows the FDA more discretion and leniency in how it approves drugs. Critics argue that the less-than-one-year average approval time does not really need accelerating and the strict research requirements do not need adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Act, the FDA can also incentivize hospitals for administering new antimicrobial drugs that have not received confirmatory approval. The Act also incentivizes &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/27/a-desire-for-an-ethical-resurrection/&quot;&gt;drugmakers&lt;/a&gt; by removing regulatory hurdles that lengthen their approval processes and make them more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to drug approvals, the Act addresses mental health care in this country: it established provisions for fighting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/21/the-epidemic-of-prescription-drug-abuse/&quot;&gt;opioid epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, strengthened laws guaranteeing access to mental health care, and provided grants to increase the number of psychologists and psychiatrists. The Act pushes society ahead in our goal of preventing devastating consequences of mental health such as homelessness, incarceration, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act has, for the most part, good motives, and it includes a little bit for a lot of people. However, it aims to fix problems that may or may not really exist and offers incentives to groups that may or may not benefit from incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the future of health care in this country is uncertain. The new administration could unwind many of the changes established by the Act and, while the Act provides a framework for authorizing these programs, future Congresses would actually need to vote on and approve the budgets that pay for the provisions in the Act. The benefits and drawbacks of the Act in the real world remain to be seen. Our lawmakers are probably looking in the right direction and trying hard to choose the right path, but just how many obstacles and speed traps we hit along the way will influence just how fast this Act can get us to safe, effective, and accessible health care.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Zebrafish-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality is one of the most complex and variable traits and describes an individual’s behaviour and habits. In order to measure personality, behavioural traits can be put on a scale, which can range for example from shy to bold, active to passive, or social to non-social; taken together the scores on each scale describe a wide variety of personality phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that personality defines organisms at the individual level it is generally assumed to be stable across different environments and circumstances, and certain personality traits are inherited from parents to their offspring. An individual’s personality will directly affect its social interactions and is likely to influence its social status. Nevertheless, social rank and dominance are also known to be context-dependent and hence can change rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study we were particularly interested in understanding how such a complex trait as personality is transmitted across generations and how much is actually determined by the parent’s genes and how much is affected by the social status and hence inherited through non-genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9248&quot; style=&quot;width: 2730px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9248&quot; height=&quot;2048&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/20141031-LarveAlive-BFDAPI-10X-0014.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2720&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Zebrafish larva&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Roy Francis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of non-genetic factors in transmitting environmental conditions experienced by the parents to their offspring has gained increasing attention over the past few years. Environmental stressors such as dietary restriction or toxins experienced by males have been of particular interest due to their mostly negative transgenerational effects on a wide range of offspring phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, much less is known about the influence of social factors on offspring behaviour and phenotype as these are often experienced during a limited amount of time. In addition, the role of the father in this context has traditionally been marginalized, especially in situations without paternal care, where males seemingly contribute nothing else but sperm and hence their genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with the recent discoveries of non-genetic factors such as different types of RNAs and modifications of the DNA that regulate gene expression also in the zygote, this stand has been overruled. Now is the time to look into the consequences of short-term variation in the paternal environment for offspring fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9247&quot; style=&quot;width: 970px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9247&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/zebrafish-experiment.jpg&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Susi Zajitschek and some of the experiments used in the study.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Susanne Zajitschek&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested male personality of zebrafish in repeated assays to create an accurate personality measurement and manipulated the social rank among males by forcing dominant males to become subordinate and vice versa. The offspring sired by the males after each of the two rounds of manipulation were found to be significantly affected by their father’s personality as well as his current social status. There was no indication for a predictive relationship between personality traits and initial dominance status, but personality traits were relatively stable across time and across manipulation periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used in vitro fertilization assays and a split-clutch design to account for paternal and maternal individual differences. The most marked differences occurred in offspring sired by fathers that were forced to change from a dominant to a subordinate status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that we found a significant influence of the father’s social environment as well as his intrinsic personality on offspring performance supports the idea that an individual’s behaviour is determined by a complex interaction between its father’s genes and his social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9249&quot; style=&quot;width: 1610px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9249&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Embryos1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Zebrafish embryos&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Roy Francis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with the idea that nature can be psychologically uplifting. But for some people, a single, brief “peak experience” in a natural setting, lasting mere seconds or minutes, changes their view of themselves or their relationships with others so profoundly that their lives are positively transformed as a result. A &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167817714692%3FjournalCode=jhpa&quot;&gt;new study &lt;/a&gt;in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&lt;/i&gt; explores exactly how and why this happens. The researchers LIa Naor and Ofra Mayseless at the University of Haifa, Israel, advertised on the internet for people who felt they’d had a transformative experience in nature to get in touch for an interview. “It was not difficult to find participants; in fact many people replied and were eager to share their experience,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26259&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volunteers – five men and ten women, aged 28 to 70 – came from a range of lifestyles, from farms, cities and communal settlements, and different countries, including Argentina, America and Israel. Naor asked them to describe their transformative experience in detail, and to focus on their perceptions and interpretations of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all participants said they’d had a profound experience in nature, for three participants, it was not life-changing. Naor and Mayseless contrasted these three with the others to tease out four factors that seemed to be important for a transformation to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the natural setting reflected and even embodied a lifelong, significant and challenging personal issue. Second, it was psychologically uncomfortable or painful to recognise this issue. Third, the experience shed new light on ways of dealing with it. And finally, the individual made a conscious choice to embed this new realisation into her identity and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the case of Hadar, aged 36, who described herself as having been a people-pleaser, always putting others’ needs before her own and not really connected to her own needs. On a hiking trip in the desert, she was resting with her group on a ledge. She’d agreed to continue climbing. But “I had this inner conflict because I really didn’t want to… but I told everybody I would. I felt so distraught, didn’t know what to do….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concrete challenge, which she had to confront, led her to realise there was a new way of dealing with this kind of issue. Hadar explains: “All of a sudden I heard myself say enough! This was so new to me because I always did what was expected of me…. I turned my head and saw the view, it was so amazing and I knew I did not have to move…it was that moment of understanding in which I knew that I could change my thinking and understanding of myself and my surroundings….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she made a conscious choice to embrace this insight: “That moment was one of the most liberating moments in my life… From that moment on, I was concerned and connected to my needs more than to others. I let go of what people were expecting and was filled with such happiness, unbelievable… this wheel started to turn…I guess the divorce was part of that… I left my job….I took control of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this challenge, realisation and transformation have happened in an office instead of a desert? Perhaps it could, but Naor and Mayseless argue that the study reveals the “process elicited by nature as embodying, mirroring, confronting and even pushing one to discover as yet unknown aspects of self.” The varied kinds of physical challenges provided in nature call for complete bodily and emotional involvement, so increasing the likelihood of this type of experience, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the challenges described in the paper were not necessarily objectively dramatic; Hadar’s story would not make for a Hollywood movie. Neither would the story of Tamar, a 48-year-old mother who said she’d always been unable to ask for help – until she found herself stuck, afraid, on a steep descent on a group hike, and realised: “Why do you always think you need to overcome everything on your own…that’s it and it’s a major issue in my life….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really mattered was the meaning of the situation to the individual. While there’s plenty of research finding that psychological resilience can be improved by getting people to just-about cope with natural challenges – such as ascending to a mountain peak – the challenges reported in this paper, while triggered by nature, weren’t necessarily extreme – and yet they carried huge significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are general lessons, they’re probably these: try to spend time in varied natural settings, be alert to what you’re thinking and how you’re feeling – and hold on to any insights that you gain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the principal target of the psychoactive constituent of marijuana, the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841) at 2.80 Å and 2.95 Å resolution, respectively. The two CB1–agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure, relative to the antagonist-bound state, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G-protein-binding region. In addition, a ‘twin toggle switch’ of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (superscripts denote Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering) is experimentally observed and appears to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G-protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The lifestyle of intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, is intimately connected to that of their host, primarily for nutrient supply. Nutrients act not only as primary sources of energy but also as regulators of gene expression, metabolism and growth, through various signalling networks that enable cells to sense and adapt to varying environmental conditions. Canonical nutrient-sensing pathways are presumed to be absent from the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, thus raising the question of whether these parasites can sense and cope with fluctuations in host nutrient levels. Here we show that Plasmodium blood-stage parasites actively respond to host dietary calorie alterations through rearrangement of their transcriptome accompanied by substantial adjustment of their multiplication rate. A kinome analysis combined with chemical and genetic approaches identified KIN as a critical regulator that mediates sensing of nutrients and controls a transcriptional response to the host nutritional status. KIN shares homology with SNF1/AMPKα, and yeast complementation studies suggest that it is part of a functionally conserved cellular energy-sensing pathway. Overall, these findings reveal a key parasite nutrient-sensing mechanism that is critical for modulating parasite replication and virulence.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Despite the wide variety of adaptive modifications in the oral and facial regions of vertebrates, their early oropharyngeal development is considered strictly uniform. It involves sequential formation of the mouth and pharyngeal pouches, with ectoderm outlining the outer surface and endoderm the inner surface, as a rule. At the extreme anterior domain of vertebrate embryos, the ectoderm and endoderm directly juxtapose and initial development of this earliest ecto–endoderm interface, the primary mouth, typically involves ectodermal stomodeal invagination that limits the anterior expansion of the foregut endoderm. Here we present evidence that in embryos of extant non-teleost fishes, oral (stomodeal) formation is preceded by the development of prominent pre-oral gut diverticula (POGD) between the forebrain and roof of the forming mouth. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging of bichir, sturgeon and gar embryos revealed that foregut outpocketing at the pre-oral domain begins even before the sequential formation of pharyngeal pouches. The presence of foregut-derived cells in the front of the mouth was further confirmed by in vivo experiments that allowed specific tracing of the early endodermal lining. We show that POGD in sturgeons contribute to the orofacial surface of their larvae, comprising oral teeth, lips, and sensory barbels. To our knowledge, this is the first thorough evidence for endodermal origin of external craniofacial structures in any vertebrate. In bichir and gar embryos, POGD form prominent cranial adhesive organs that are characteristic of the ancient bauplan of free-living chordate larvae. POGD hence seem arguably to be ancestral for all ray-finned fishes, and their topology, pharyngeal-like morphogenesis and gene expression suggest that they are evolutionarily related to the foregut-derived diverticula of early chordate and hemichordate embryos. The formation of POGD might thus represent an ancestral developmental module with deep deuterostome origins.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Plasticity of the cell state has been proposed to drive resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapies, thereby limiting their effectiveness. A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGFβ-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin. We identify vulnerability to ferroptic cell death induced by inhibition of a lipid peroxidase pathway as a feature of therapy-resistant cancer cells across diverse mesenchymal cell-state contexts.

 T cells directed against mutant neo-epitopes drive cancer immunity. However, spontaneous immune recognition of mutations is inefficient. We recently introduced the concept of individualized mutanome vaccines and implemented an RNA-based poly-neo-epitope approach to mobilize immunity against a spectrum of cancer mutations. Here we report the first-in-human application of this concept in melanoma. We set up a process comprising comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. All patients developed T cell responses against multiple vaccine neo-epitopes at up to high single-digit percentages. Vaccine-induced T cell infiltration and neo-epitope-specific killing of autologous tumour cells were shown in post-vaccination resected metastases from two patients. The cumulative rate of metastatic events was highly significantly reduced after the start of vaccination, resulting in a sustained progression-free survival. Two of the five patients with metastatic disease experienced vaccine-related objective responses. One of these patients had a late relapse owing to outgrowth of β2-microglobulin-deficient melanoma cells as an acquired resistance mechanism. A third patient developed a complete response to vaccination in combination with PD-1 blockade therapy. Our study demonstrates that individual mutations can be exploited, thereby opening a path to personalized immunotherapy for patients with cancer.

 Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are no mechanism-based therapies. The disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments, whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4–3.5 Å resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer’s disease. Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306–378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a range of neurodegenerative diseases.

 Chromosomes in proliferating metazoan cells undergo marked structural metamorphoses every cell cycle, alternating between highly condensed mitotic structures that facilitate chromosome segregation, and decondensed interphase structures that accommodate transcription, gene silencing and DNA replication. Here we use single-cell Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) analysis to study chromosome conformations in thousands of individual cells, and discover a continuum of cis-interaction profiles that finely position individual cells along the cell cycle. We show that chromosomal compartments, topological-associated domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops, all defined by bulk Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell-cycle dynamics. In particular, DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments and a reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 to S and G2 phase. Whole-genome three-dimensional structural models reveal a radial architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our single-cell data therefore allow re-interpretation of chromosome conformation maps through the prism of the cell cycle.

 Glioblastoma is a universally lethal cancer with a median survival time of approximately 15 months. Despite substantial efforts to define druggable targets, there are no therapeutic options that notably extend the lifespan of patients with glioblastoma. While previous work has largely focused on in vitro cellular models, here we demonstrate a more physiologically relevant approach to target discovery in glioblastoma. We adapted pooled RNA interference (RNAi) screening technology for use in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models, creating a high-throughput negative-selection screening platform in a functional in vivo tumour microenvironment. Using this approach, we performed parallel in vivo and in vitro screens and discovered that the chromatin and transcriptional regulators needed for cell survival in vivo are non-overlapping with those required in vitro. We identified transcription pause–release and elongation factors as one set of in vivo-specific cancer dependencies, and determined that these factors are necessary for enhancer-mediated transcriptional adaptations that enable cells to survive the tumour microenvironment. Our lead hit, JMJD6, mediates the upregulation of in vivo stress and stimulus response pathways through enhancer-mediated transcriptional pause–release, promoting cell survival specifically in vivo. Targeting JMJD6 or other identified elongation factors extends survival in orthotopic xenograft mouse models, suggesting that targeting transcription elongation machinery may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma. More broadly, this study demonstrates the power of in vivo phenotypic screening to identify new classes of ‘cancer dependencies’ not identified by previous in vitro approaches, and could supply new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune response, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies.

&lt;p&gt;In the lab, psychologists have shown how generosity propagates and spreads. If someone is kind to us, we tend to “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20364907&quot;&gt;pay it forward&lt;/a&gt;” and act more generously to someone else when given the chance. But it’s not clear if these findings are realistic. For example, when we’re juggling priorities on a busy work day, might receiving an act of kindness actually be a nuisance, leaving us feeling indebted to return the favour when we’ve got more important things to do? An uplifting &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24716-001/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Emotion&lt;/i&gt; looks at acts of altruism within a real-life working environment, and shows how kindness really does ripple outwards from a good deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26238&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of California headed by Joseph Chancellor studied workers from Coca Cola’s Madrid site, a group of mostly female employees from a range of departments. Participants were told they were part of a happiness study, and once a week for four weeks they checked in to report how they were feeling, in terms of mood and life satisfaction, and their experience of positive and negative behaviours, including how many they had carried out towards others, and how many others had made towards them. Four weeks later, the participants completed further measures, such as of their happiness and job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most of the group, 19 of the participants were in cahoots with the researchers: they were “givers” whose task each week was to perform acts of kindness towards some of their co-workers (they were to refrain from showing kindness to other co-workers who served as a control group). It was up to the givers what generous acts they performed – Chancellor’s team wanted to make sure these participants had autonomy in what they did, rather than obeying an injunction (we know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/11/pressuring-employees-to-be-do-gooders-can-backfire-badly/&quot;&gt;this can turn out badly&lt;/a&gt;) – examples of the favours they performed included bringing someone a drink, and emailing a thank-you note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did a month of extra kindness mean for the workers who were on the receiving end, for the givers, and for the organisation as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acts of kindness don’t go unnoticed. The receivers observed more prosocial behaviours in the office and by the end of the study, they were reporting ten times more prosocial behaviours than the controls. In addition, receivers’ level of “felt autonomy” – essentially how much they felt in control of their days at work – were higher than controls over the course of the study, although it’s worth noting that this was because autonomy dropped in controls while it held steady in the receivers (Seth Margolis, a co-author on the paper, told me that work conditions were likely getting harder over the study period, with the acts of kindness acting as a buffer). One month after the study ended, the receivers were also enjoying significantly higher levels of happiness than controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving was itself rewarding, and on some indicators more rewarding than receiving. The givers saw the same preserved autonomy enjoyed by receivers, and additionally saw benefit to their sense of competency (again relative to declining control scores) – presumably decorating Nuria’s monitor with a smiley face made of post-its reminds you of your creative potential. The givers’ one-month followup measures were also more impressive than the receivers’: they enjoyed higher levels of life satisfaction and job satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms. This suggests that in this context, giving had a more durable effect than receiving.  This shouldn’t be so surprising, as evidence suggests &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5870/1687&quot;&gt;we feel happier when spending money on others than ourselves&lt;/a&gt;, and acts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2014.983959&quot;&gt;kindness increase autonomy and competence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and consistent with past lab studies, the research showed that receivers didn’t just enjoy acts of kindness – they paid them forward. By the end of the study, the receivers reported engaging in nearly three times more prosocial behaviours than did the controls. If this were direct reciprocity – Nuria figuring out who got busy with the smiley stickies on her monitor and fetching them a coffee as a thank you – then we would expect to see the givers reporting many more positive behaviours by study end. But they didn’t, suggesting that the acts were paid forward to someone other than the original giver, due to a sense of elevation and desire to participate in an organisation that was treating them in an ideal way. This contributes to the idea that while there are individual origins of prosociality, there is also a strong contagious quality to it, moving socially through groups, in much the way that phenomena such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/11/when-and-why-does-rudeness-sometimes-spread-round-the-office/&quot;&gt;rudeness&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652652&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So workplace acts of kindness – freely chosen – appear to be a way to create virtuous cycles within organisations, benefiting the recipients, the givers, and the climate at large. Just get the goodness started, and enjoy its growth all around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24716-001/&quot;&gt;Everyday Prosociality in the Workplace: The Reinforcing Benefits of Giving, Getting, and Glimpsing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 The medical journal Prenatal Diagnosis recently played host to a vigorous debate over whether a male fetus was spotted engaging in masturbation on ultrasound.





The alleged case of antenatal autoeroticism was reported by Spanish gynecologists Vanesa Rodríguez Fernández and Carlos López Ramón y Cajal in September last year. Their paper was called In utero gratification behaviour in male fetus. Here's the ultrasonic evidence of the act:

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The brain shows a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental stimuli that is critical to the process of learning and memory. This flexibility is attributable in part to rapid modifications of neuronal structure and function. A recent study has illuminated how these rapid changes take place, involving the storage of a readily releasable pool of RNA transcripts in the nucleus of neurons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is a plastic organ that undergoes frequent structural and functional modifications in response to input from the environment. Neuronal activity produces changes in the expression of proteins at &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2006/09/17/the-synapse-volume-1-issue-7/&quot;&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt; and in the connections between neurons. This plasticity relies on the transcription of different genes, which involves the production of messenger (mRNA) from DNA. The level of specific mRNA transcripts can be measured to determine when a gene is turned on or off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to neuronal activity, two waves of mRNA are produced: immediate early genes, and activity-regulated transcripts. The first set of transcripts are made in approximately 30-60 minutes in response to neuronal activity.  Some of these mRNAs encode transcription factors that activate another transcription cascade to produce proteins involved in growth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/05/could-targeting-mitochondria-be-the-key-to-treating-psychosis/&quot;&gt;cell signaling&lt;/a&gt;, and synaptic function. Neuronal activity can also modify transcription through alternative splicing, whereby a single gene can encode multiple proteins. Each gene contains multiple introns and exons. Introns are excised before the final RNA sequence is translated to protein. Different combinations of exons can remain following intron removal, and each combination will produce a different protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that neuronal cells express a large number of long genes (&amp;gt;100 kilobases) that encode proteins important for synaptic function. Since genes of this length would require several hours to transcribe, this raised the question of how plastic changes occur so rapidly. This is the question Oriane Mauger and colleagues sought to answer in their recent study, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(16)30900-X&quot;&gt;Targeted Intron Retention and Excision for Rapid Gene Regulation in Response to Neuronal Activity&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Peter Scheiffele from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, investigated whether alternative splicing is involved in rapid &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/28/neuronal-transplantation-may-restore-brain-functionality/&quot;&gt;neuronal plasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Alternative splicing takes only seconds to a few minutes, and occurs during transcription. One type of alternative splicing is intron retention, where introns are retained in fully transcribed, mature transcripts. These transcripts are identified by the presence of a stretch of adenine bases, called the polyA+ tail, at the end of the mRNA sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of intron retention in plasticity, the researchers first isolated and sequenced mature polyadenylated RNA sequences from &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/02/26/the-chattering-brain-how-chronic-pain-throws-our-cortex-out-of-sync/&quot;&gt;brain cortex&lt;/a&gt; samples. The samples were isolated from mice on postnatal day 10 (juvenile) and day 50 (adult), and from 16.5-day-old mouse embryos that had been cultured for 2 weeks. They calculated the number of transcripts that were spliced and the number that retained introns. The intron-retaining (IR) transcripts made up 5-6% of all of the isolated transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then treated cells with transcription inhibitors and found that the majority (84%) of intron retention events persisted. They theorized that these retained introns might be excised in response to neuronal activity in order to rapidly modify gene expression. They tested this hypothesis by treating cells with bicuculline, a drug that increases neuronal network activity. Some introns showed increased retention, while others were excised in response to neuronal stimulation. These results were validated for several specific transcripts, showing that the excision of &lt;em&gt;Clk1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fnbp11&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tia1&lt;/em&gt; occurred rapidly in response to bicuculline. Using drug treatments, the researchers  were also able to show that activity-dependent intron excision is triggered by calcium signaling downstream of synaptic glutamate receptors, called NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gene ontology analysis was performed to see what categories of genes were modified by activity-dependent intron excision. In instances where an intron was excised in response to neuronal activity, these genes were shown to be involved in cell signaling and cellular architecture, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/&quot;&gt;microtubule&lt;/a&gt; proteins, actin cytoskeleton proteins, phosphoisositide 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and Rho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell fractionation experiments were performed to determine where in the cell the intron-containing transcripts were located. These experiments showed the presence of these transcripts in the cell nucleus. Neuronal stimulation caused an increase in the number of spliced transcripts in the cytosol, suggesting that they were exported. These cytosolic transcripts were found to be associated with ribosomes, indicating that they were being translated, or turned into protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these experiments showed that a pool of mature DNA transcripts retain their introns. These introns are rapidly excised in response to neuronal activity, and the spliced RNA is transported to the cytoplasm for translation to protein. This mechanism allows new proteins to be rapidly generated in response to neuronal activity, modifying cellular architecture and supporting plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/Aerial_view_of_the_Amazon_Rainforest-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tropical forests are the richest terrestrial ecosystems on earth and home to millions of different plant and animal species. At the same time, these regions are the most endangered terrestrial habitats worldwide. They harbour the highest percentage of endemic species and many of them are thus listed as biodiversity hotspots (exceptionally rich but threatened ecosystems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pristine tropical forests are decreasing with dramatic speed and often only mosaics of small remnants remain, embedded within agricultural areas and human settlements. This dramatic conversion of pristine forest habitats is a worldwide phenomenon and notably the most important driver of the current biodiversity crisis. Many species of different taxa are declining or even went extinct during the last decades. However, not all species are declining, and some survive successfully or even increase in abundance in these strongly disturbed habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9235&quot; style=&quot;width: 2010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9235&quot; height=&quot;1500&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/fig1_ricefields_reduced.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The loss of pristine tropical forests is mostly caused by the conversion of habitat to e.g. agricultural landscapes like rice fields.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Mark-Oliver Rödel&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their semi-permeable skin and mostly biphasic life-cycle with aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults, amphibians are particularly influenced by their environment. Thus the loss and alteration of their natural habitats, but also the on-going global climate change, are making them highly vulnerable. Although the most threatened class of vertebrates, not all amphibians disappear in human-altered landscapes. The question is, why do different species respond to environmental change so differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies target the threatened species, the losers, but usually nobody cares about the winners, although it is most likely these species which will dominate the globes’ future ecosystems. We were therefore interested to uncover the reasons for being a successful species in degraded habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a unique pantropical data set, comprising published records and our own data on frog species occurrences in tropical forests, forest fragments, and more intensely altered landscapes such as plantations or settlements. For these species we gathered life-history (e.g. body size, clutch size) and ecological traits (e.g. preferred habitat) as well as distribution data, all of which might influence the response of a species to forest degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9236&quot; style=&quot;width: 591px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9236 size-full&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/fig2_frogs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;581&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Frog species with different forest dependencies. The Variable Squeaker Frog (&lt;em&gt;Arthroleptis variabilis&lt;/em&gt;, left) is widely distributed, does not depend on streams due its direct development, prefers the leaf litter, and is thus according to our results not dependent on pristine forests; Mertens Egg Frog (&lt;em&gt;Leptodactylodon mertensi&lt;/em&gt;, right) is in comparison more limited in its distribution, its tadpoles develop in streams, adults live in the leaf litter, and might thus tolerate forest disturbance to some extent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Mareike Hirschfeld&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a combination of different statistical approaches, we revealed that those species with indirect development (species with tadpoles), that occur over large ranges and wide elevational distribution, being further independent of streams, and inhabiting the leaf litter, cope best with modifications of their natural habitats. Species sharing these traits will likely persist in altered tropical forest systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings will help to predict future frog communities and thus identify the species with an increasing effect on ecosystems and their functioning in our human-dominated world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up and down the land parents and teenagers are engaged in tense negotiation and diplomacy in an effort to maintain domestic peace. Some households are finding more success than others. Their secret, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191730191X?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, is a literal meeting of minds – synchronisation of brain cell firing seems to foster emotional harmony. Moreover, when parents and their teenagers display this “neural similarity”, write Tae-Ho Lee and his colleagues, “this promotes youths’ psychological adjustment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are intriguing findings – in the fact the researchers claim this is the first time that anyone has compared the brain activity of parent-child dyads with their interpersonal relations. However, sceptics will baulk at the rampant neuro-reductionism and at the paper’s repeated claims of brain-based causation on the basis of purely correlational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26110&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 31 teens and their primary caregiver. The latter was always either the teen’s mother or father, genetically related to them. The average age of the parents was 43 years and just under 90 per cent were mothers. The teens were a roughly 50-50 mix of boys and girls, with an average age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each parent and teen participant underwent a 6-minute brain scan in which they lay still and looked at a cross on a screen. From this, the researchers identified each person’s resting state “connectome” showing the patterns of neural firing across the brain and the functional connectivity between 13 different brain networks (the researchers described this as showing each participant’s “unique brain fingerprint”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, every teen and parent also kept a daily diary, reporting their positive and negative moods. The teens also completed an “emotional competence” questionnaire about their ability to identify and describe their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho Lee and his team looked at the emotional synchrony between each parent-child dyad – whether they tended to report the same kinds of emotions each night or not – and found plenty of variability. Some dyads showed a lot of similarity, others were completely out of kilter. The researchers also looked at the level of similarity in the brain connectomes of each parent-teen pair, finding that some were more “neurally in-tune” than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two measures correlated, as in the parent-teen pairs who showed greater emotional synchrony also tended to show greater neural synchrony. “We propose that children’s neural connectome is a psychological representation at the neural systems level, resulting from shared experiences with their primary caregiver,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a correlation between greater neural synchrony between parent and teen and the teen’s level’s of emotional competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers conducted a mediation analysis, which is a statistical technique for testing how factors might be associated. This showed that neural synchrony was linked to greater emotional competence via emotional synchrony (consistent with the possibility that neural similarity fosters emotional synchrony, which leads to greater emotional competence). In contrast, the analysis suggested that neural synchrony did not  mediate the association between parent-teen emotional synchrony and teens’ emotional competence (in other words, this is not consistent with the idea that emotional synchrony breeds neural synchrony, which fosters greater emotional competence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the researchers made repeated causal claims, such as: “dyadic brain similarity plays an important role in children’s emotional competence &lt;em&gt;by contributing to&lt;/em&gt; more synchronised emotional mood fluctuations”; and “We provide the first empirical evidence unpacking how the brain’s functional organisation is shared between individuals and influences emotional synchrony, ultimately &lt;em&gt;conferring benefits&lt;/em&gt; for youths’ development”; and “the degree of neural similarity in parent-child dyads &lt;em&gt;promotes&lt;/em&gt; youths’ psychological adjustment” (all emphases added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a purely correlational study so there’s no way to know if any of the factors – parent-teen emotional synchrony, parent-teen neural synchrony, teen emotional competence – are causally related. Mediation analysis is no substitute for data derived from longitudinal and/or experimental methods. Yes, it is fascinating to see how complex emotional relations between parents and their teens may manifest at a neural level, but it seems overly reductionist and simplistic to claim that brain activity is the root cause of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even assuming that neural synchrony between parents and teens really is an important influence on parent-teen harmony and teens’ psychological adjustment, it’s hard to imagine, from a clinical or everyday perspective, that this is a particularly useful or practical level at which to think about or intervene in family life.&lt;/p&gt;

 Five years ago I blogged about the debate over whether the blue-for-boys, pink-for-girls color convention used to be the other way around. My post focused on a 2012 paper by psychologist Marco Del Giudice arguing that the idea of a cultural &quot;pink–blue reversal&quot; in the English-speaking world in the early 20th century is a myth.



Now, Del Giudice has published an 'update' revisiting the issue. Based on text data from late 19th and early 20th century American newspapers and magazines, Del Giu</content>
